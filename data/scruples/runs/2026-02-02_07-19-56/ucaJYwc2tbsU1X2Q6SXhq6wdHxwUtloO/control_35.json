I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The situation is that they got a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial issues, they had to return it to the shelter. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers too because the dog was returned twice before. The person feels guilty but couldn't afford to take care of it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Financial hardship is a real issue. The person lost their job and is paying off student loans. Taking on a pet's expenses might be irresponsible if they can't afford it. But pets are a long-term commitment, so giving up a pet could be seen as not responsible too.\n\nThe dad gave the dog as a gift, expecting the person to take care of it. The stepmom's allergies add another layer\u2014maybe the dad knew about the allergies but gave the dog anyway. The person couldn't give the dog back to their dad, so returning it to the shelter was the only option. The shelter workers were judgmental, but the dog's well-being is important. The person didn't want to neglect the dog, so returning it might be the right call.\n\nHowever, the dad's reaction is harsh, but the person's decision might be justified due to circumstances. The key points are responsibility to the pet vs. personal financial constraints. Since the person couldn't adequately care for the dog, returning it might be the more ethical choice to prevent neglect. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
