I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe person got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but they lost their job and have financial issues. They couldn't afford the dog's expenses, tried for a day, then returned it. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is furious, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, the person's reasons: they can't afford the dog's needs, which are significant. Pets require ongoing costs like food, vet bills, toys, etc. If they can't cover these, keeping the dog would be irresponsible. They also mention their stepmom's allergies, so returning it to their dad isn't an option. The shelter is the only viable place left.\n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh, calling them selfish and implying they should have used credit cards. That's a heavy judgment. But from the person's perspective, using credit cards could lead to more debt, which isn't helpful when they're already struggling with student loans and unemployment. They might not want to take on more debt, especially if job prospects are uncertain.\n\nThe shelter workers felt the dog deserves a forever home, but if they can't provide that, returning the dog is better than neglect or abandonment. The dog might be rehomed by someone else. The person is also dealing with guilt, which shows they care about the dog's well-being.\n\nSo, is the person wrong? They made a difficult decision based on their current financial instability. They didn't want to neglect the dog, so returning it was responsible. The dad's anger seems misplaced, as it's not the person's fault they lost their job. The stepmom's allergies also prevent the dog from going back home. The person is prioritizing practicality over an emotional gift they can't support.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a tough choice considering their circumstances and the dog's needs.\n"
