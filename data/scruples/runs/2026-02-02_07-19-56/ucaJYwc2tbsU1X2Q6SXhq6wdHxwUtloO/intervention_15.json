I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who returned a shelter dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received the dog as a birthday gift from their dad. Their financial situation is bad\u2014they lost their job and have student loans. They couldn't afford the dog's expenses and ended up returning it to the shelter. The shelter workers were judgmental because the dog had been returned twice before, and the dad is upset, even accusing them of selfishness and cruelty. The person feels guilty and is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's reasons. Financial instability is a significant factor here. They lost their job and are struggling to pay bills, let alone cover pet expenses. The person didn't want to take on the responsibility they couldn't afford. That seems responsible because not everyone can take on pet ownership if they can't provide proper care. However, the dog was from a shelter and had been returned twice, which might mean it's a vulnerable animal already. The shelter workers' judgment adds another layer\u2014maybe they feel the dog isn't getting a fair chance.\n\nOn the other hand, the person didn't keep the dog for long\u2014just a day while trying to figure out finances. They couldn't give it back to their dad because of allergies. The dad's reaction is harsh, calling them selfish and bad, but maybe the dad's approach is also problematic. The person didn't want to leave the dog in a bad situation, so returning it to the shelter might be the only option left.\n\nI should weigh financial responsibility against the dog's well-being. If someone can't afford a pet, it's irresponsible to keep it. But the dog's situation is also important. However, the person acted quickly, didn't keep the dog long, and tried to find a solution. The guilt they feel suggests they care about the dog. The shelter workers' comments might be valid, but the person's circumstances are real. The dad's reaction is harsh and doesn't consider the financial struggles. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they made a tough decision based on their limitations. But some might argue that they should have found another way, hence the debate. I think the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
