I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The person's situation is that they got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but they lost their job and can't afford the dog's expenses. They returned the dog to the shelter, which has returned the dog twice before. The dad is upset, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the factors here. The person is in a financial crisis, unemployed, and has student loans. They love dogs but can't afford the vet bills, food, etc. They tried for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. The stepmom is allergic, so they can't give the dog back to their dad. The shelter workers criticized them, and the dad is angry, suggesting they should have used credit cards.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. On one hand, they did return the dog quickly, which might seem harsh, especially if the dog has been returned before. The dad's anger and the potential for the dog being euthanized adds to the guilt. But on the other hand, the person is in a tough financial situation. They might be making a responsible decision to avoid neglecting the dog in the future.\n\nIs there an obligation to keep a gifted pet? Legally, maybe not, but emotionally and ethically, it's complex. The person might feel they're doing the right thing by not taking on a responsibility they can't handle. However, the shelter's position that the dog deserves a forever home complicates it. Maybe there was a way to find another solution, like fostering until they could afford it or finding a new home through the shelter's resources.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also part of the equation. He might not be considering the financial realities, suggesting credit cards which could lead to more debt. The person's guilt shows they care, but the conflict with their dad is real.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the person made a decision based on their inability to care for the dog properly, then maybe not. But the quick return and the dog's history might make some argue they should have tried harder. However, considering the financial situation and the stepmom's allergy, maybe they didn't have other options. The answer might depend on whether they had alternatives before returning. If they tried to find another home or contacted the shelter for options, they might be in the right. If they just returned it without trying other avenues, maybe not. The prompt says they kept the dog for a day while figuring it out, then returned. That seems rushed. Maybe they should have given it more time or sought help from the shelter first. But given the circumstances, it's a tough call. I think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they made a responsible decision given their situation, even if it's a hard one.\n"
