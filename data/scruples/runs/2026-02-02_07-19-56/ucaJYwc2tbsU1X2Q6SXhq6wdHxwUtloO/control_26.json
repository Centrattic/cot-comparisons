I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they got a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but they couldn't afford it due to financial issues like losing their job and student loan payments. They returned the dog to the shelter, and now they're feeling guilty, plus their dad is angry, saying they're selfish and that the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author received a living being as a gift, which they didn't ask for. They have a responsibility to care for the dog if they accept it. But they had financial constraints. The key point is whether they had the means to take care of the dog before accepting it. If they knew their financial situation was bad, maybe they should have declined or discussed it immediately. However, it was a surprise, so they might have initially thought they could manage, then realized it wasn't possible.\n\nThe shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The author might feel guilty because the dog is now at risk of being euthanized. But is it their fault? They tried to return the dog as soon as they realized they couldn't care for it. If they had kept the dog and couldn't afford it, the dog might have ended up in worse conditions. So, maybe returning it was the responsible choice, even though it's emotionally difficult.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also important. He's upset and is pressuring the author to figure it out financially, even suggesting credit cards. But the author is in a real financial bind. It's not fair to expect them to take on more debt if they can't afford it. The author's responsibility is to themselves and their financial stability, especially if they can't provide for the dog properly.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as responsible because they recognized their inability to care for the dog and returned it to the shelter instead of neglecting it. However, the dad's perspective is that the author should have found a way, which is a common family dynamic where expectations clash with reality.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They made a tough decision based on their circumstances. The shelter's judgment might not be fair either, but the main issue is the author's responsibility versus their financial limitations. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
