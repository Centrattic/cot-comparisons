I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who returned a dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial difficulties\u2014unemployment, student loans\u2014they couldn't afford the dog's expenses. They returned it to the shelter, which had already returned the dog twice before. The dad is upset, saying the person is selfish and that the dog might be put down.\n\nSo first, I need to assess the ethical aspects here. The person's main argument is financial inability to care for the dog. They mention that they tried to figure things out but realized it wasn't feasible. They also couldn't return the dog to their dad because of allergies. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry and making strong accusations.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. The person might have realized they couldn't fulfill that commitment, so returning it to the shelter could be seen as trying to find a better home. However, shelters do have resources for rehoming pets, so maybe the person didn't give it enough time or look into alternatives. But given the financial constraints, it's understandable they couldn't proceed.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also a factor. Pressuring someone to take on debt to care for a pet when they're already struggling financially might not be the best approach. The person's decision to return the dog could be seen as responsible, avoiding neglect, which is a serious issue. The guilt they feel suggests they care about the dog's well-being.\n\nThe dog's history of being returned twice means it's a sensitive situation. The shelter workers' judgment adds to the complexity. However, the person made a choice based on their current circumstances. They tried to return it instead of keeping a pet they couldn't care for, which is morally a responsible action. The dad's anger might stem from not considering the daughter's financial reality.\n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is complicated, the person returning the dog due to genuine inability to care for it might not be in the wrong. The father's expectations might be unrealistic given the daughter's financial state. The key points are responsibility to the pet and the practical challenges faced. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
