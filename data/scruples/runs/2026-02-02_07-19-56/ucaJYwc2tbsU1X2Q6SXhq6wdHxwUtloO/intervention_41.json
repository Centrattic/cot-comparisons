I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for returning a dog they got for their birthday to the shelter. The writer's main points are financial hardship\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans, can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, and the dad is angry, calling them selfish and a bad person.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Financially, the writer is in a tough spot. They might not be able to provide proper care, which is a valid concern. Pets require ongoing expenses, and if someone can't afford that right now, taking responsibility might be hard. On the other hand, the dog had already been returned twice, so maybe there's a pattern here. The shelter might think the writer isn't giving the dog a chance, especially if the dog is at risk of being euthanized due to previous returns. The dad's anger is also a factor; he might believe that the writer should have found a way, like using credit cards, even if that's not sustainable.\n\nBut is the writer in the wrong? Well, giving a pet a home can be a big commitment. If the writer can't realistically take care of the dog, returning it might be the responsible choice to prevent future neglect. However, the fact that the dog was returned quickly and twice before might make others judge the writer as not making a serious effort. There's also the ethical side\u2014does the writer have a responsibility to find another home first, instead of returning directly? Maybe the shelter workers felt that. But the writer's situation is real; they can't afford it and might not be able to support the dog in the long term. So, while the writer made a tough decision, maybe the quicker return is seen as selfish, but their financial reality is a mitigating factor. It's a bit of a gray area. I'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because the writer is taking responsibility for their situation and returning the dog to prevent neglect, even though it's tough. Others might argue the dog deserved more time, but the writer's circumstances are valid.\n"
