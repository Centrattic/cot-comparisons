I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about returning a dog they got for their birthday to a shelter because of financial issues. The person lost their job, has student loans, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They returned the dog after a day, but the shelter workers and their dad are upset. The person feels guilty and is seeking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The person's reasoning is that they can't take care of the dog financially. The dad is upset and thinks they should have used credit cards, but the person is in a tough financial spot. The stepmom is allergic, so returning to the dad isn't an option. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is unsure. \n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. The author received a dog as a gift but couldn't afford to care for it. They tried to keep it for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. The main points are financial inability and the dog's welfare. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. If you can't afford it, taking one on might be irresponsible. However, the situation is complicated by the author's current financial crisis. They had good intentions but couldn't follow through. The shelter workers were judgmental because the dog has been returned twice before, which adds another layer. The dad's anger is about the dog possibly being put down, but the author's decision was to prevent neglect. \n\nIs the author at fault? On one hand, they accepted the dog as a gift, then returned it quickly. On the other hand, they made a difficult decision because they couldn't afford it. Maybe the dad should have considered the financial situation before giving the dog. The author isn't malicious; they're in a tough spot. The key is whether the author is responsible for the dog's welfare despite their circumstances. \n\nIn some views, once you take a pet, you're responsible until you can find a proper home. However, the author returned it to the shelter, which is better than keeping it and neglecting it. So maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. The dad's expectation of using credit cards might not be realistic if the person is already struggling. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong. They made a tough call based on their situation. The responsibility also lies with the dad for not considering the financial aspect before gifting the dog. The author's guilt shows they care, so they're not intentionally cruel. Their actions, while causing upset, were to prevent further harm to the dog if they couldn't care for it properly.\n"
