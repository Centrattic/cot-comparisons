I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for returning a dog they got from their dad's shelter adoption. Their financial situation is bad\u2014unemployed, student loans, can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is mad, calling them selfish and a bad person, saying the dog might get put down.\n\nSo, the key points here are the person's circumstances versus the dog's well-being. On one hand, the person is in a tough financial spot and can't provide proper care, which is a valid concern. It's better not to have a pet if you can't afford it. On the other hand, the dad is upset and the shelter workers feel the dog deserves a forever home. The person returned the dog quickly, which might show they didn't want to keep it despite knowing the risks.\n\nBut the person didn't have other options. The stepmom is allergic, so giving the dog back to the dad wasn't possible. They tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't feasible. Returning to the shelter might have been the only responsible choice to prevent neglect. However, the dog having been returned twice before complicates things. The shelter might have limited resources, and rehoming a dog multiple times isn't ideal. \n\nThe person's guilt suggests they care about the dog's welfare, but they had to prioritize their own financial stability. The dad's reaction is harsh, but his expectation that the person should have taken on more debt (credit cards) to keep the dog might not be realistic. \n\nSo, considering all factors, is the person in the wrong? They made a tough decision based on their inability to care for the dog properly. The alternative would be to keep a dog they can't afford, which could lead to neglect later. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
