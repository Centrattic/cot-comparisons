I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they got a dog for their birthday from their dad, but due to financial issues, they returned the dog to the shelter after a day. They feel guilty and are getting backlash from both the shelter and their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author lost their job, is paying off student loans, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They tried to keep it for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. The stepmom is allergic, so they couldn't give it back to their dad. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, implying the dog is at risk of being euthanized now. The dad is angry, calling the author selfish and a bad person, suggesting they should have used credit cards to manage.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's decision was wrong. On one hand, giving up a pet is a big decision, and the shelter's concern about the dog's future is valid. The dad's argument is that the author should have found a way to \"figure it out,\" maybe by taking on debt. On the other hand, the author is in a tough financial situation and might not be able to provide proper care, which is a responsible concern. The stepmom's allergy also complicates returning the dog to the original home.\n\nI think the author's main responsibility is to ensure the dog is well cared for. If they couldn't afford it and couldn't find another home, maybe they should have tried to rehome the dog first. But given the stepmom's allergy, that wasn't an option. The shelter's judgment might be because the dog is at higher risk of euthanasia due to multiple returns. However, the author's decision was based on their own financial constraints, which they can't control. \n\nThe dad's reaction seems harsh, implying the author should prioritize the dog over their financial health, but that's not always feasible. The author might not be in the wrong if they made a responsible decision despite the guilt. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong), as they acted based on their circumstances, even if it's a tough choice.\n"
