I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person got a dog for their birthday from their dad, but they can't afford to take care of it right now. They returned the dog to the shelter because of financial issues. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's job loss and financial struggles are real. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. The stepmom is allergic, so returning it to the dad isn't an option. They returned the dog to the shelter, which had returned twice before. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is angry, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down.\n\nThe key points here are the person's responsibility and the context. Was there another option? The person couldn't keep the dog due to financial constraints and the stepmom's allergies. They didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford. The shelter might have other alternatives, but the person made a decision based on their current situation. \n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh, suggesting they should've used credit cards, which isn't practical advice if they're already struggling with student loans. The person's intention wasn't to abandon the dog but to make a tough choice for the dog's and their own well-being. \n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the person made a difficult decision out of necessity. They didn't ignore the problem; they acted quickly but faced judgment from others. The shelter's comment about the dog being returned twice might imply the dog is hard to place, but the person didn't know that. \n\nIn conclusion, the person isn't in the wrong because they made a responsible decision based on their financial reality and the dog's environment. The guilt they feel is valid, but the decision itself was necessary for both parties.\n"
