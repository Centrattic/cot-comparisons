I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person got a dog from a shelter as a birthday present from their dad. They love dogs but are in a tough financial spot\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans, and can't afford the dog's needs. They kept the dog for a day, then returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and saying the dog might be put down. The person feels guilty but didn't want to neglect the animal.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether returning the dog was wrong. Let's break down the factors. The person's financial situation is a key point. They can't afford to take care of the dog, which is a legitimate reason. They tried to find a solution for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. They didn't want to keep the dog if they couldn't provide proper care. On the other hand, the dad's reaction is harsh, and the shelter workers were judgmental. But the person acted to prevent neglect, which is responsible.\n\nAnother angle: the dog was from a shelter, so shelters often have resources to rehome pets. Even though it's been returned twice, being returned again doesn't necessarily mean the dog will be euthanized immediately. Shelters usually try to find new homes. The person's decision might have been hard but necessary given their circumstances. Also, they felt guilty, showing they care about the dog's well-being.\n\nThe dad's criticism about using credit cards seems impractical. Opening new credit cards might not solve the financial problem and could lead to more debt. The person is trying to pay off loans and find a job, so taking on more debt isn't advisable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. The person recognized they couldn't fulfill that commitment and made a difficult decision to return the dog rather than neglecting it. That's responsible. The guilt indicates they care, which is a positive sign.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person isn't in the wrong. They made a tough choice based on their situation to avoid neglect. The answer should be B.\n"
