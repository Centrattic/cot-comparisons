I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to a shelter. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author got a dog from their dad as a birthday present. The dog was adopted from a shelter. The author is currently facing financial difficulties: they lost their job, are paying off student loans, and can't afford the dog's needs. They kept the dog for a day before returning it because they couldn't financially support it. They couldn't return it to their dad due to a stepmom's allergies. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is upset, calling the author selfish and saying the dog might be put down. The author feels guilty and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether the author made the wrong decision by returning the dog. The author's reasoning is about financial inability to care for the dog. The dad's argument is that the author should have found a way, maybe through credit cards, to take responsibility. The shelter workers feel the dog deserves a forever home and the author's action was harsh.\n\nLegally, when you adopt a pet, there's usually an agreement to care for it. Giving it back might violate that agreement, but shelters sometimes allow returns if the situation is dire. However, ethically, the author is trying to make a responsible decision by not taking on a responsibility they can't handle. On the other hand, the dog might have been better off with the author if they could have found a solution.\n\nThe author's actions were based on their current inability to provide for the dog's needs. They didn't keep it for personal gain or cruelty but because of financial constraints. However, maybe they could have sought help, like fostering the dog temporarily or finding another home. But the immediate return after a day might be seen as hasty. Still, given the circumstances, it's a tough choice between personal financial health and the dog's welfare. Since the author took the dog back to the shelter, the dog is back in a system that might find it a better home, even if it's a risk of being put down. The author acted out of necessity, not malice. So, while it's a difficult situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their financial stability when they can't provide proper care.\n"
