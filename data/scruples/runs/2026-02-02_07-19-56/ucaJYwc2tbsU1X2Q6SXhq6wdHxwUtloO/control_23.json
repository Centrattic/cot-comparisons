I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe author got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad. The dog was adopted from a shelter. The author is in a tough financial situation\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers were judgmental because the dog had been returned twice before, and the dad is angry, accusing the author of being selfish. The author feels guilty and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they couldn't afford the dog and didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't handle. They returned it to the shelter, maybe thinking it's the right decision for the dog's long-term wellbeing. But the dad and shelter workers are upset because the dog might be put down again.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, taking care of a pet is a big responsibility, financially and otherwise. If someone can't provide for a pet, maybe returning it quickly is better than abandoning it later. But the dog has been returned twice already. Each return might reduce the chances of adoption, possibly leading to euthanasia. So the author's decision could lead to that outcome, which is tragic. But the author's financial situation is real\u2014maybe they didn't have a choice. The dad's reaction is harsh, expecting the author to take on debt, which might not be fair given their current situation.\n\nFactors to consider: Did the author give it enough time? They kept it for a day. That's very short. Maybe they should have tried to find another solution first, like temporary foster, or help from the shelter. But if they couldn't afford it at all, maybe there's no other option. Also, the stepmom's allergy complicates returning the dog to the father.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author didn't want to be in a position where they couldn't care for the dog, which is responsible. But returning a dog to a shelter when it's been returned before might not be the best outcome. However, the author isn't in a position to keep it. So the answer might depend on whether the author is taking responsibility for their situation. They aren't wrong for not wanting to take on a responsibility they can't handle, but maybe they could have done more to find an alternative. But given the circumstances, maybe they didn't have a better option. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
