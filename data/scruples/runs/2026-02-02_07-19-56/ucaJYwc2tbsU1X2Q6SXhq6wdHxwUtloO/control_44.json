I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The situation is that they got a dog from their dad as a birthday present, but due to financial difficulties from losing a job and student loans, they couldn't afford the dog. They returned it to the shelter, but the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is upset, saying the dog might get put down and that the person is selfish. The user is feeling guilty and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person's financial situation is dire\u2014they lost their job and are trying to pay off student loans. They couldn't afford the vet bills, food, etc. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized it wasn't possible. The dog was already returned twice, so maybe the shelter had tried to place it before. The dad's reaction is harsh, calling them selfish and a bad person. \n\nOn one hand, taking in an animal is a commitment, and returning it might seem like a failure to follow through. But the person's financial instability is a real issue. They might not be in a position to care for the dog properly, which could be neglectful in the long run. Also, the stepmom's allergies prevent the dog from going back to the original owner. The shelter workers judged them, but maybe that's because they want the dog to stay in a home. However, if the person can't support the dog, maybe returning it was the right choice to prevent future neglect.\n\nThe person's intention wasn't to be cruel; they wanted to avoid taking responsibility for something they couldn't afford. The dad's anger is part of the problem here. The person made a tough decision based on their circumstances. While returning a pet isn't ideal, the alternative might be the dog being neglected. The guilt suggests they care about the dog's well-being. So, considering all factors, the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
