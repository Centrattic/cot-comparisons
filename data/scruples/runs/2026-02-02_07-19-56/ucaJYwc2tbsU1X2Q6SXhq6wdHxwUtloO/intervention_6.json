I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they received a dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial difficulties, they returned the dog to the shelter. They feel guilty because their dad is upset and the shelter workers also gave them the cold shoulder. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The author lost their job, is struggling with student loans, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They kept the dog for a day before returning it. They couldn't give it back to their dad because the stepmom is allergic. So, they tried to find a solution but couldn't, hence returning to the shelter.\n\nOn one hand, taking in an animal is a long-term commitment. By taking the dog, they might have taken responsibility, and returning it quickly could be seen as not considering the dog's well-being. The shelter workers mentioned the dog was returned twice before, which might imply the dog has a hard time finding a home. The dad is also upset, feeling that the author is selfish and that the dog might be put down.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's financial situation is dire. They're unemployed and trying to pay off debts. They didn't want to take on a pet they couldn't afford. Maybe they thought it was better to return the dog than to neglect it later. The decision might have been made out of necessity, not malice.\n\nI should also think about the intentions. The author didn't want to keep the dog because they couldn't provide proper care. They tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't possible. Was the return done responsibly? They returned it to the shelter, which is the right place for the dog to find a new home, even if it's returned multiple times. The guilt they feel suggests they care about the dog's welfare.\n\nThe father's reaction seems harsh. Using the dog as a birthday gift might not have considered the daughter's ability to care for it. The author didn't have a say in the gift, so they couldn't prepare for the responsibilities. The stepmom's allergy adds another layer, making returning to the original home impossible.\n\nSo, weighing the responsibility to care for an animal against the person's current financial state. If they couldn't afford the dog, keeping it would mean neglecting the animal's needs. The author's decision might be in the dog's best interest in the long run, even if it's hard to accept. However, the act of returning a pet so quickly might be seen as not being committed, but the circumstances are extenuating.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. Their situation is difficult, and they made a hard choice out of necessity. The dad's approach was perhaps not considerate of the daughter's financial state, using a dog as a gift without ensuring she could care for it. The shelter's judgment might be valid, but the author's actions were based on responsibility to the dog's welfare given their constraints.\n"
