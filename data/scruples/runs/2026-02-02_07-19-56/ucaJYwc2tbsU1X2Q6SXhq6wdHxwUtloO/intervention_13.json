I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to the shelter. The situation is that the person got a dog from a shelter as a present from their dad, but due to financial issues\u2014unemployment, student loans\u2014they couldn't afford the dog's expenses. They kept it for a day, tried to figure out the finances, but realized it wasn't possible. They couldn't return it to their dad because the stepmom was allergic, so they returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned before, and the dad is mad, calling them selfish and blaming them for the dog possibly being put down.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion. They want an answer of A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). Let me think this through.\n\nFirst, the person received a dog as a gift. They might not have been in a position to accept it, especially with their financial situation. The dad gave the dog intending it to be a permanent home, right? So the person's responsibility would be to take care of the dog. But they couldn't afford the costs. However, they only kept the dog for a day before returning it. The question is whether they made the right choice or not.\n\nOn one hand, the person is in a tough financial spot. They can't provide proper care, and maybe it's better to return the dog earlier than later to avoid neglect. But on the other hand, the dog had been returned twice before, and now the shelter workers are upset because they want a forever home. The dad is upset too, feeling that the person is being selfish.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that they didn't want to take on a pet they couldn't afford. But they might have considered alternatives first. For example, could they have found temporary help, like a foster situation, or asked the shelter if there are any payment plans or charities that help with pet expenses? Also, maybe reaching out to the dad to explain the situation more thoroughly instead of just returning the dog. The dad was expecting a gift, and the person didn't consult him before returning the dog, which might be part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the fact that the person couldn't return the dog to their dad because the stepmom is allergic\u2014that's a valid reason. But maybe they could have found another temporary solution? Or tried to contact the shelter first to see if they could work something out. The shelter workers' judgment is another point. If the dog has been returned twice, maybe the shelter is under pressure to find a home quickly, and returning it again complicates things. But that's the shelter's perspective.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the person is making a tough decision to avoid financial burden. But they might feel that they failed their responsibility as a pet owner. However, if they couldn't provide proper care, then maybe it's better to release the dog sooner rather than later. But the dad's reaction is also harsh, implying that the person should have found a way, maybe through credit, which isn't always the healthiest solution but is what he's suggesting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky situation. If you accept a pet as a gift, you have a responsibility to care for it. But if you're in a position where you can't do so, maybe returning it quickly is the right choice. However, perhaps they should have communicated better with their dad before returning the dog, or maybe explored more options. The shelter workers' judgment might be because the dog has been through a lot, and the author's quick return adds to that trauma. But the author's financial situation is real and valid. \n\nIn some ways, the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a responsible decision to avoid neglect. On the other hand, they might have handled it differently. Since they returned it so quickly and without consulting the giver, maybe they did something wrong in the process. But the core issue is their inability to care for the dog due to financial reasons, which is beyond their control. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they made a tough decision to not put the dog in a bad situation due to their circumstances.\n"
