I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person got a dog for their birthday from their dad. They lost their job, have financial issues, and couldn't afford the dog's care. They returned it to the shelter but felt guilty. Their dad is upset, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down. The user thinks the author is at fault but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the financial situation and the responsibility of taking care of a pet. Pets require long-term commitment, and if someone can't afford it, getting one might not be responsible. But in this case, the dog was a gift, so maybe the author didn't anticipate the financial burden.\n\nWait, the dog was a surprise gift. The author might not have had a say in getting it. But once they received it, they have a responsibility to care for it. However, if their financial situation changed (losing a job), maybe they couldn't keep it. But the problem is that returning a dog, especially one that's been returned before, might not be the best solution. Shelters have limited resources, and rehoming is often better. But the author couldn't return it to the dad because of allergies. \n\nThe shelter workers judged them because the dog was returned twice. That's a red flag. Maybe the shelter can't take her again, which could lead to euthanasia. The dad is upset, but the author might be doing what's necessary for themselves. However, not considering alternatives like fostering, fundraising, or finding another home could make them responsible. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a tough spot. They tried to figure it out for a day, which might not be enough time. But maybe they should have communicated earlier or considered the consequences before accepting the dog. The line between being responsible and making a tough decision is blurry here. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether they took enough steps to find another solution before returning the dog. If they only tried the shelter and couldn't, maybe they weren't at fault because they had no other options. But if they didn't explore other possibilities, then they might be. Since the scenario says they returned it to the shelter but faced judgment there, maybe they had no other option. However, the dad's reaction and the shelter's role complicate things. \n\nOverall, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault because their circumstances are out of their control, but they could have handled it differently. The correct answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they had valid reasons and couldn't afford to care for the dog. But some might argue A because of the dog's prior returns and possible euthanasia. I'm leaning towards B because the author made a difficult decision under financial stress and couldn't keep the dog.\n"
