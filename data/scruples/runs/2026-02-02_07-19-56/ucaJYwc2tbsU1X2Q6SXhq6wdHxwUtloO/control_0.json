I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they got a dog as a surprise birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial difficulties, they returned the dog to the shelter. Now they're feeling guilty and their dad is upset, even saying the dog might be put down. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person loves dogs, so they didn't take the dog on out of malice. They lost their job and are struggling financially, which makes it hard to afford vet bills, food, etc. They tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't possible. They couldn't return the dog to their dad because the stepmom is allergic. So they had to return it to the shelter. The shelter workers were judgmental, saying the dog had been returned twice and deserved a forever home. The dad is angry, calling the author selfish and a bad person.\n\nNow, thinking about responsibility. The dad gave the dog as a surprise, which might mean he didn't fully consult the author's ability to care for it. The author's stepmom being allergic is a problem, so maybe the dad should have considered if the dog would be a good fit for the household if the author couldn't keep it. The author's main issue is financial, which is a real concern for pet care. Pets are a long-term commitment, and not being able to afford it is a valid reason to return a pet. However, returning the dog to the shelter might be seen as giving up easily, especially since it's the second or third time the dog is being returned. The shelter workers might be concerned about the dog's chances of being adopted again if it's returned too many times, which could lead to euthanasia if no home is found.\n\nBut the author's responsibility is to their own financial stability. If they take on a pet they can't afford, both the dog and their financial situation could suffer. The dad's reaction seems harsh, especially suggesting opening new credit cards, which might not be a realistic or responsible financial move. The author also considered for a day, which is a short time, but maybe they needed to find another solution quickly. However, the dog's well-being is a priority. If the author returns the dog immediately after a short time, maybe they should have tried to find an alternative home first instead of the shelter. That could show more effort to ensure the dog's future.\n\nBut the options given are whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are the financial inability, the stepmom's allergy, and the immediate return. The author's intention was to not take on a responsibility they couldn't handle, which is understandable. The dad's anger might stem from unmet expectations and not considering the daughter's circumstances. The shelter's comment about the dog being returned multiple times adds to the guilt, but it's the shelter's perspective, not necessarily the author's fault if the previous owners couldn't keep it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a tough choice due to valid financial reasons. They didn't keep the dog for a long time, which might be seen as not being committed, but they had a good reason. The dad should have thought about the daughter's ability to handle the pet when giving it as a gift. The author's actions might be seen as responsible in the long run, even though it's hard in the short term. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
