I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about returning a dog they got for their birthday to a shelter because of financial difficulties. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person received a dog as a surprise birthday gift from their dad. They lost their job, are struggling financially, and can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized they couldn't manage. They couldn't give it back to their dad because the stepmom is allergic. Then they returned it to the shelter, faced judgment there, and their dad is angry, accusing them of being selfish and causing the dog to be put down.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The author's main argument is that they can't afford to care for the dog. Responsibility towards a pet is a big commitment, and not being able to provide for it could be considered neglect. But on the other hand, the person is in a tough financial situation, unemployed, and trying to pay off student loans. They returned the dog to the shelter to prevent it from living in a home where it can't be properly cared for. The shelter workers judged them, saying the dog was returned twice before, which might mean the dog is less likely to be adopted again, leading to euthanasia.\n\nThe dad is upset, but the author didn't take the dog on for the purpose of being cruel. They made a choice based on their circumstances. However, taking on a pet is a long-term responsibility. If they knew they couldn't afford it, maybe they shouldn't have taken the dog in the first place. But the dad gave the dog as a surprise, so the author might not have had a choice. Also, they tried to keep it for a day before returning it, which shows they considered their responsibility.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they made a hard decision to prevent the dog from being in a home that can't care for it. But they might have alternatives they didn't consider, like reaching out to animal rescue groups, fostering, or asking the shelter for help. However, the situation is complex. The author's financial state is dire, and they might not have the means to properly care for the dog. They returned it to a shelter, which is a responsible step compared to other options like giving it to someone unprepared.\n\nThe key here is whether the author acted responsibly given their circumstances. The shelter workers' judgment might be harsh, but the author's decision was to prevent further neglect. The dad's anger is valid in that he wanted the dog to have a forever home, but the author's responsibility is to their own financial stability and not taking on more than they can handle. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be at fault because they returned the dog to a shelter, which is a responsible action. However, taking on a pet when they knew they couldn't afford it might be seen as initially irresponsible. But since it was a surprise gift, they might not have had a choice. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they returned it to a shelter where the dog could potentially get a better home, rather than keeping it in a situation where it would be neglected.\n"
