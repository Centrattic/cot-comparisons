I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad. They lost their job, are struggling financially, and can't afford the dog's needs. They tried to keep the dog for a day but had to return it to the shelter. The shelter is upset because the dog has been returned twice before. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and a bad person, and blaming them for the dog's potential euthanasia. The person feels guilty but didn't want to neglect the dog.\n\nThe question is whether they're at fault. The user initially thinks the author is at fault but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the factors. The person's financial situation is a key point. If they can't afford to care for the dog, keeping it might lead to neglect, which is worse. Returning the dog to the shelter might be the responsible choice to prevent suffering. However, the dog has been returned twice, which complicates things. The shelter might have difficulty placing it again, increasing the risk of euthanasia. \n\nBut the person's intention was not to be cruel; they wanted to ensure the dog gets a proper home. They didn't return it immediately, only after a day of trying to figure things out. The dad's reaction seems harsh, suggesting he didn't consider the daughter's financial reality. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there were other options, like a relative or friend who could take the dog temporarily. But the stepmom is allergic, so that's not feasible. The person might not have other options. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone can't care for a pet, returning it to the shelter is a way to give it another chance, even if it's hard. The guilt comes from wanting to do the right thing but facing criticism. \n\nThe key here is whether the person acted in the dog's best interest. They did return it to avoid neglect, which is a good intention. The shelter's judgment might be valid, but sometimes multiple returns are necessary for the right home. \n\nSo, considering all this, the person isn't in the wrong. They made a tough decision based on their circumstances to prevent neglect, even though it's a hard choice. The answer should be B.\n"
