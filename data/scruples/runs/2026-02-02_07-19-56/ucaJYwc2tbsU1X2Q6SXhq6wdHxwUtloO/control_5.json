I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's read through the situation again. The person got a dog from a shelter for their birthday, but their financial situation is bad right now. They lost their job and are trying to pay off student loans. They couldn't take care of the dog financially, so they returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them, the dad is mad, and the person is feeling guilty. The question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the person's reasons. They didn't get the dog on purpose; it was a surprise from their dad. They love dogs but couldn't afford the responsibilities. Financial hardship is a real issue here. They tried to figure it out for a day and realized it wasn't possible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of an allergy. So returning to the shelter was their only option.\n\nBut the shelter workers mentioned the dog was returned twice and deserved a forever home. The dad is upset, saying the dog might be put down. The person is struggling with guilt. The key points here are the inability to care for the dog and the consequences of returning it. \n\nOn one hand, adopting a pet is a big commitment. If you can't take care of it, it's better to return it than to neglect it. But the person didn't adopt the dog themselves; it was a gift. They had no control over the situation. However, by accepting the dog, they might have implicitly agreed to take care of it. But their dad should have considered their ability to care for it before getting the dog.\n\nThe person's situation is dire financially, which is a valid reason. They don't want to be in a position where they can't provide for the dog, which is responsible. However, the dog has a history of being returned, so maybe it's challenging to place. But the person's decision to return it isn't malicious; it's out of necessity. \n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh, expecting them to figure out finances through credit cards, which might not be feasible. The person's responsibility to their own financial stability is also important. So, is the person in the wrong? They didn't abandon the dog; they returned it to the shelter. The guilt they feel is understandable, but their decision was made with the dog's welfare in mind, even if it's a hard choice. \n\nFactors to consider: the intent behind the action, the ability to care for the pet, the alternatives available. The person tried to find a solution but couldn't. The shelter is the responsible place to return the pet. So maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the fact that the dog was returned twice complicates things. But the person's inability to care for it now might be more important. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they made a responsible decision due to financial constraints and couldn't find another solution. The dad should have considered their ability to care for the dog before giving it. The person's guilt is genuine, but the action was necessary.\n"
