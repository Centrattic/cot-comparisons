I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The situation is pretty clear: the dad got a dog for the birthday from a shelter, but the person couldn't afford to care for it due to financial issues. They returned it to the shelter, but the dog had been returned twice before, and now the dad is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, the person took the dog in knowing they couldn't afford it. They might have thought they could manage, but their financial situation made it impossible. On the other hand, the dog was from a shelter, which might have limited resources, and returning a dog multiple times could lead to the dog being euthanized, as the shelter workers mentioned.\n\nThe dad's reaction is strong, calling them selfish. But the person's reasoning is about being unable to support the dog financially. They didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't handle. But is that a valid reason? Adoption is a long-term commitment. By taking the dog, they might have committed to taking care of it, regardless of financial issues. However, the person immediately returned it after a day when they realized they couldn't afford it. So maybe they didn't fully consider the responsibility before taking it. \n\nThe stepmom's allergy adds another layer. Maybe the family wasn't all on board with the dog, which complicates the situation. The shelter workers' judgment also points out that the dog was returned twice, making the person's return a third time, which isn't ideal. \n\nFinancial hardship is a real issue. The person might not have had the means to care for the dog, so it's hard to blame them for wanting to return it. But the act of returning it so quickly could be seen as not being fully committed. However, if they had taken the dog knowing they couldn't handle it, that's different. The key is whether they acted in the dog's best interest, even if it's hard for them. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call. The person might be in the right for not wanting to take on a responsibility they can't handle, but also in the wrong for not considering the dog's situation, especially since it's been returned before. The answer might depend on the balance between personal financial constraints and the animal's welfare.\n"
