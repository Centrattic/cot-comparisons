I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the dad gave a dog from a shelter as a birthday present. The person can't afford to take care of it due to job loss and student loans. They tried for a day, couldn't manage, and returned the dog. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is angry. The person feels guilty and is asking if they're the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The person's responsibility as a pet owner. Pets are long-term commitments, not just gifts. If they knew they couldn't commit, maybe they shouldn't have taken the dog. But the dog was a gift from the dad, so maybe they were in a tough spot. Financial issues are real. They might not be at fault if they genuinely can't afford it. But then again, getting a pet when you can't provide care is a problem. The dad's reaction is harsh, but the person returned the dog to prevent neglect. \n\nThe shelter workers' judgment is another angle. The dog has been returned twice, so finding a home is hard. The person returning it might contribute to the dog being put down. But they returned it because they couldn't take care of it, which is better than keeping it in bad conditions. \n\nThe key points: The person didn't plan for the financial responsibility before taking the dog. Maybe they should have said no or considered alternatives. However, they didn't want to keep the dog in a bad situation, so returning it to the shelter is a responsible action. The guilt is from their own conscience, not legal or ethical wrong. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, taking a pet without the means to care for it is irresponsible. On the other, they returned it quickly to avoid longer-term issues. The answer depends on whether taking the dog without the ability to care for it is considered wrong. If the person should have refused the gift or found another solution, they might be at fault. But since they returned it quickly and didn't keep the dog in bad conditions, maybe not. \n\nThe dad's anger and the shelter's judgment are external reactions, but the person's actions were to prevent neglect. So maybe the answer is B, they are not in the wrong. They made a difficult decision out of necessity.\n"
