I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for returning the dog. Let's start by reading through their situation again.\n\nThe user got a dog from a shelter for their birthday as a surprise from their dad. They love dogs but are in a tough financial spot. They lost their job, are paying off student loans, and can't afford the dog's expenses. They tried to keep it for a day but realized they couldn't manage financially. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because the stepmom is allergic, so they returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them, saying the dog had been returned twice before and deserves a forever home. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and a bad person, and says the dog might be put down because of them. The user is really guilty and asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is whether returning the dog was the right decision. The person's argument is that they couldn't financially support the dog and didn't want to take in an animal they couldn't care for properly. On the other hand, the dad and shelter workers feel that the person was selfish and didn't make enough effort to find a solution.\n\nFinancial stability is a big part of responsible pet ownership. If someone can't afford a pet, taking one on could be considered irresponsible. However, it's also true that once you have a pet, you're responsible for their care. The user tried for a day but gave up quickly. But considering their financial situation, maybe they don't have the means to take on such a responsibility right now. \n\nThe stepmom's allergy is a valid reason why the dad couldn't take the dog back. So the user didn't have another immediate option. They returned it to the shelter, which is a better option than abandoning the dog elsewhere. The shelter workers' reaction might be harsh, but their concern is for the dog's well-being. The fact that the dog was returned twice before makes the situation more complicated. The user might feel they're contributing to the dog's instability, but they did return it to the shelter where the dog could be placed again.\n\nThe dad's anger is a bit problematic. Pressuring someone to take on financial obligations beyond their means isn't fair. He's blaming the user for the dog's potential euthanasia, which might not be entirely their fault if the dog was already struggling to find a home. The user's main responsibility was to not take in a pet they couldn't support, even if that means making a difficult decision.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the user made a tough choice based on their circumstances. They tried to do the right thing by returning the dog to the shelter rather than neglecting it. The guilt comes from not wanting to be selfish, but their financial situation is real. The answer would likely be that they're not in the wrong (B).\n"
