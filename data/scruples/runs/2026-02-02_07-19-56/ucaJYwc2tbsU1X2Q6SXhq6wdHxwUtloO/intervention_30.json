I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but they can't afford to take care of it right now. They returned it to the shelter after a day. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers also judged them because the dog was already returned twice.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether returning the dog was wrong. On one hand, the person is in a tough financial situation\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans. They might not be able to provide proper care. But on the other hand, getting a dog as a gift and then returning it so quickly might be seen as irresponsible. The dad's reaction is harsh, but he might feel like they didn't try hard enough to find another solution, like using credit cards or finding alternative funding.\n\nBut wait, the stepmom is allergic, so returning it to the dad isn't an option. The person had to take responsibility. However, returning the dog to the shelter might lead to the dog being euthanized, which adds to the guilt. Is there a middle ground? Maybe they should have tried to find a foster home or a rescue group first. But given the urgency of their financial situation, maybe they felt they had no choice.\n\nThe shelter workers' judgment is a point too. The dog was already returned twice, so the person might feel like they're contributing to the problem. But if they couldn't care for the dog, maybe they were in a position where they had to do what was best for the dog even if it's hard.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They had good intentions but made a tough decision. The dad's anger might be misplaced, but the person is struggling. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they made a difficult choice to avoid neglecting the dog. They considered alternatives and returned it to the shelter, which is better than leaving the dog without care. The guilt they feel shows they care, but the situation is complex. So, B.\n"
