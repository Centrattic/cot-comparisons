I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for returning the dog to the shelter. The person got the dog as a birthday present from their dad, but they lost their job and are in financial trouble. They couldn't afford the dog's expenses and returned it, but now they're feeling guilty because their dad is angry and the shelter workers judged them.\n\nHmm, so I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The main points are financial hardship and the decision to return the dog. On one hand, the person didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford. Pets do require a lot of resources, and it's irresponsible to keep one if you can't provide for it. On the other hand, the dog was already returned twice, which might make this decision even harder. The dad is upset because he thought the dog deserved a forever home, and the author is struggling with guilt.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they couldn't afford the dog, so returning it was necessary. But maybe they should have tried to find another solution, like finding a foster home or talking to the shelter about options before giving the dog back. The dad's reaction is harsh, but the author might have felt trapped. However, the dog's well-being is a priority. If the author couldn't provide proper care, returning it might be the responsible choice. Still, the dog being returned multiple times could affect its chances of being adopted again. So there's a conflict between personal circumstances and the dog's welfare.\n\nI think the key is whether the author acted with the best interest of the dog in mind. If they returned it because they couldn't care for it, maybe that's the right choice. But the guilt comes from the dad's anger and the shelter workers' judgment. The author is in a tough spot, but they might not be in the wrong for making a difficult decision based on their financial situation. However, maybe there were other steps they could have taken before returning the dog, like seeking help or temporary solutions. But given the circumstances, I lean towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
