I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for returning a dog to the shelter after receiving it as a birthday gift. The person explains that their financial situation is bad due to unemployment and student loans, and they couldn't afford the dog's needs. They also mention that their stepmom is allergic, so they couldn't give it back to their dad. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, and the dad is upset, saying the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. Taking on a pet is a big commitment, and if you can't afford it, it's not just about the money. Pets require care, attention, and long-term responsibility. Returning the dog after a day might be seen as not fully considering the commitment. But the person's financial situation is dire, and they might be worried about the dog's well-being if they can't provide.\n\nThen, the dad's perspective. He gave the dog as a gift, expecting it to be kept. The stepmom's allergy means the dog can't stay with the family, so returning it to the shelter might be the only option. However, the dad is upset and blames the author. But the author didn't take the dog on for financial reasons, so maybe the dad's reaction is harsh.\n\nThe shelter workers said the dog deserves a forever home. Returning a dog twice before might make it harder for the dog to find a new home, increasing the risk of euthanasia. The author might feel guilty about contributing to that cycle. But the author's decision was to avoid neglecting the dog in the future, which is a responsible choice. However, maybe they should have considered alternatives first, like temporary care or finding another home before returning.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they could have found another solution to provide for the dog, maybe yes. But given their financial state and the stepmom's allergy, maybe the shelter was the only option. The dad's criticism might not be fair since he's not considering the author's current situation. However, taking a pet when you can't afford it is generally unwise. It's a tough call. On one hand, they made a responsible decision to ensure the dog isn't neglected. On the other, the timing and the dog's history might make the action seem hasty. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author acknowledged their inability to care for the dog and returned it to the shelter instead of leaving it in a bad situation. While it's unfortunate and might have been handled better, the guilt and effort to find a solution show they care about the dog's well-being. The shelter is the appropriate place, even if it's hard for the dad to accept.\n"
