I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the details. The author received a dog from their dad as a birthday present, but their financial situation is bad\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans, and can't afford vet bills, food, toys, etc. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, and the dad is angry, calling the author selfish and a bad person. The author feels guilty and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's main argument is that they can't financially support the dog, which is a valid concern. They mention they lost their job and are struggling to pay their own bills. Returning the dog after a day seems hasty, but maybe they tried to figure things out quickly. However, the dad's reaction is harsh, accusing them of selfishness and cruelty. The shelter workers also criticized them, noting the dog's history of being returned twice.\n\nNow, thinking about responsibilities towards pets. When someone takes in a dog, especially from a shelter, there's an expectation of providing a permanent home. The author might have thought they could manage, but realized it wasn't financially feasible. But the decision to return the dog quickly could be seen as not considering the dog's well-being enough, especially if the shelter workers are concerned about the dog being put down again. The author's guilt is real, and they didn't want to neglect the dog, but maybe they didn't consider alternatives like rehoming it themselves or finding financial assistance.\n\nHowever, the author is in a vulnerable financial position. They might not have the means to take on a pet's expenses, which is understandable. The dad's insistence on using credit cards or \"figuring it out\" might not be realistic if the author is already in a precarious situation. The stepmom's allergy is another factor that prevents returning the dog to the original owner.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? On one hand, they returned the dog quickly without perhaps trying all possible solutions. On the other, they made a difficult decision based on their inability to provide for the dog, which is a responsible choice in some ways. The shelter workers' judgment adds to the complexity, as the dog's history of returns might mean it's more challenging to find a home. The author's guilt suggests they care about the dog's well-being, even if their actions were hasty.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a tough call. The author might be criticized for not finding a better solution before returning the dog, but their financial constraints are real. The dad's reaction is also problematic\u2014blaming the author harshly without understanding their financial struggles. The author's decision, while not perfect, might be a responsible choice given their circumstances, rather than keeping the dog in poor conditions. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to be sure. The key is whether the author acted unreasonably. Since they made a difficult decision based on their ability to care for the dog, even if it's not ideal, they might not be entirely in the wrong.\n"
