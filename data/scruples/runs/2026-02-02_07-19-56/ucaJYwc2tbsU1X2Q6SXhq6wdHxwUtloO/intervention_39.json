I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. The scenario is that the dad got a dog from a shelter as a birthday present. The person can't afford the dog due to financial issues\u2014lost job, student loans. They kept the dog for a day and returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers were judgmental, the dad is upset, and the person feels guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities involved. When you adopt a pet, it's a long-term commitment. The shelter workers might have told them that. But the person here had valid financial reasons. They didn't want to be in a position where they couldn't care for the dog properly. On the other hand, returning a dog, especially one that's been returned before, can be tough for the animal. Shelters do have limited resources and some dogs might end up euthanized if they can't find homes.\n\nThe dad is angry, calling the person selfish. But the person's situation is real. They can't afford vet bills, food, etc. So, is it wrong to return a dog for financial reasons? Or is it better to find another solution? The person tried to give the dog a home but realized they couldn't sustain it. Maybe they could have looked for help, like fundraising or contacting the shelter for financial assistance. But they didn't mention that. However, the stepmom's allergies made returning the dog to the dad impossible, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points are the commitment of pet ownership and the financial responsibility. The person is in a tough spot, but maybe they should have thought about the long-term before accepting the dog. However, the dad was the one who got the dog initially. So, the person is trying to do the right thing by returning it rather than neglecting it. The shelter workers being judgmental is a red flag, but the person's actions were to prevent neglect. I think the answer is B, they're not in the wrong because they're acting in the best interest of the dog given their circumstances, even if it's a hard decision.\n"
