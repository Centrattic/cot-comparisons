I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who returned a dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation is that the person received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial difficulties, they couldn't afford to care for it. They returned the dog to the shelter, which caused some backlash from the shelter workers and their dad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person's financial situation is a key factor. They lost their job and are struggling with student loans. They mention they can't afford vet bills, food, etc. So, if they can't properly care for the dog, keeping it might be neglectful. But they did keep the dog for a day before returning it. That seems quick, but maybe they did it to avoid neglecting the animal.\n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh, calling them selfish and implying the dog might be put down. The shelter workers also judged them because the dog was returned twice before. But the person's intention was to not take on a responsibility they couldn't handle. Is that selfish, or is it responsible? \n\nLegally, in many places, you can't just abandon a pet, but returning it to the shelter is different. If the shelter is willing to take the dog back, maybe that's better than the dog being surrendered again. The person isn't keeping the dog against its will or neglecting it immediately. They made a difficult decision based on their circumstances.\n\nThe dad's argument that they should have used credit cards to \"figure it out\" might not be feasible. Financial advice to max out credit cards isn't practical for someone already in a tough spot. The person is trying to manage their debt and job search.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the person's decision was based on their inability to provide proper care. While it's hard, they might be doing the right thing by the dog's welfare. The guilt they feel suggests they care about the dog, but their financial reality is a valid reason. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. But some might argue they should have found another way, like fostering temporarily or seeking help. However, the immediate return to the shelter might be the best option given the constraints. Answer B.\n"
