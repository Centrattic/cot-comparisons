I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about returning a dog to a shelter after receiving it as a birthday gift from their dad. The author lost their job and has financial issues, so they couldn't afford the dog's expenses. They returned the dog, but the shelter workers judged them and their dad is angry, saying the dog might get put down.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer needs to be between A or B. Let me break it down. The author's reasons are financial hardship. They couldn't provide proper care, which is a valid concern. But the dad gave the dog as a gift, so returning it might have been unexpected. The shelter workers mentioned the dog was returned twice before, which complicates things. The author might feel guilty, but they didn't want to neglect the animal.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad's reaction is harsh, comparing the author to being selfish and cruel. But the author's decision was out of necessity. Is it wrong to return a pet you can't afford? Maybe not, because it's better for the animal to be in a better home than neglected. But the dog has been returned twice, so maybe the author is adding to that. However, the author's situation is genuine financial struggle. \n\nI think the key point is the author's intention. They didn't want to abandon the dog, but had to return it because they couldn't support it. That's responsible. The shelter's judgment is perhaps about the dog's history, but the author's action was to help the dog. The dad's anger is more about the emotional aspect, but the author's decision was practical. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
