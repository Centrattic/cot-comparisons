I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person got a dog from a shelter as a birthday present. They love dogs but are in a tough financial situation after losing their job and dealing with student loans. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized they couldn't afford the expenses. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because the stepmom is allergic. So, they returned the dog to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, and the dad is furious, calling them selfish and a bad person. The person feels guilty and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the person is in a difficult financial situation. They couldn't afford to care for the dog properly. Taking in a pet without the means to support it can be irresponsible, especially since animals need long-term commitment. Returning the dog to the shelter might prevent the dog from getting another home, but the shelter's job is to find homes, not to keep the dog. The person didn't want to take the dog if they couldn't provide, which is responsible.\n\nOn the other hand, the dog was already returned twice. Maybe the person should have tried harder to find another home before returning it. But given the allergies and financial issues, that might not have been feasible. Also, the dad's anger and the shelter's judgment might be harsh, but the person's decision was based on their inability to care for the dog, which is a valid reason. The person isn't keeping the dog for selfish reasons but due to financial constraints.\n\nI think the key point is whether taking on a pet is possible. If they couldn't afford it, then taking it on would be irresponsible. But returning it quickly shows they realized their mistake. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe they should have thought through the commitment before accepting the dog. But the dad gave it as a surprise, so they might not have had a choice. However, they returned it quickly, which is better than neglecting it later.\n\nI'm leaning towards B, not in the wrong, because they made a tough decision based on their situation. The dad's expectations might be unrealistic given the financial circumstances.\n"
