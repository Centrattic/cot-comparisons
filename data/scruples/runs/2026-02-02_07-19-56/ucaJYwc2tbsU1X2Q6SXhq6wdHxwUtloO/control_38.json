I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for returning a dog they got as a birthday gift to a shelter. The situation is that they couldn't afford to take care of the dog due to financial issues\u2014lost job, student loans, etc. They tried for a day and realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of an allergic stepmom, so they returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is angry.\n\nHmm. So, the user is wondering if they made the wrong decision. Let's break it down. The person's financial situation is dire, so keeping the dog would be irresponsible. They didn't want to take on more debt or risk the dog's well-being. On the other hand, the dog was already returned twice, and the father is upset. The shelter workers mentioned the dog might be put down, adding to the guilt.\n\nFrom a responsibility angle, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. If you can't afford it, it's actually more compassionate to return it to the shelter where it can be placed with someone who can care for it properly. The person didn't keep the dog out of spite but because they couldn't provide adequate care. The father's anger might stem from not considering the daughter's financial constraints and the reality that shelters exist to rehome animals. The stepmom's allergy is another factor that makes returning to the dad impossible. \n\nSo, while the person feels guilty, their action was to prevent neglecting the dog. The shelter's role is to find new homes, so maybe they shouldn't be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but I should make sure there's no selfish intent. The person did try to figure it out for a day, then made a responsible decision. The dad's reaction might be harsh, but the user's choice was to avoid harm. Hence, B.\n"
