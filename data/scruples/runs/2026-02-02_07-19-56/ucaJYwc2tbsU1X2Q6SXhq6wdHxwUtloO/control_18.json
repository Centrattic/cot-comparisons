I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is they got a dog from a shelter for their birthday as a present from their dad. But they lost their job, have financial issues, and can't afford the dog. They tried to keep it for a day but had to return it to the shelter. Now they're feeling guilty and their dad is mad, saying they're selfish and that the dog might get put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their responsibilities. When you adopt a pet, you're supposed to take care of it long-term. The person might feel they're letting the dog down, but they also can't afford it. Is it their fault for not being able to take care of it? Or is the dad wrong for giving them a dog when they might not be in a stable financial position?\n\nThe person tried to find a solution but couldn't. They couldn't return the dog to their dad because of the stepmom's allergies. So returning it to the shelter was their only option. The shelter workers judged them, but maybe that's because the dog has been returned before. However, the person's main issue is their inability to care for the dog financially. \n\nFinancial instability is a real problem. People can't be expected to take on financial responsibilities they can't handle. If the dad gave the dog as a gift without considering their financial situation, is that also a factor? The person didn't ask for the dog; it was a surprise. So they didn't make the dog a problem, but now they're stuck with it and can't provide for it. \n\nThe dad is upset and even called them selfish. But is the person selfish for returning it when they can't take care of it? Maybe not. Letting the dog stay in a situation where it's not properly cared for would be worse. Returning it to the shelter gives it another chance, even if it might get put down. It's a tough choice, but maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they're making a difficult decision based on their circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, adopting a pet is a commitment. If you can't commit, maybe you shouldn't take the pet. But the person didn't have a choice\u2014they were given the dog. They tried to keep it as long as they could. So maybe the fault isn't entirely on them. The dad might share some responsibility for giving a pet without considering the financial stability of the recipient.\n\nIn conclusion, the person acted responsibly by returning the dog when they realized they couldn't take care of it. The guilt comes from not wanting to abandon the dog, but they had to make a hard decision. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
