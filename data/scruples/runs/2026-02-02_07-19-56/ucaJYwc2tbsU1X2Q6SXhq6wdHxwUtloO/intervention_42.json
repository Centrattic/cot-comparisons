I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to a shelter. The author has financial issues, lost their job, and can't afford to care for the dog. They returned it after a day because they felt they couldn't support it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main points are responsibility towards the animal and the circumstances of the person. On one hand, the author received a dog as a gift, which is a living being that requires care. Returning it to the shelter might seem like a neglectful action, especially if the dog has been returned before. The shelter workers and the father feel it's wrong because the dog might not get another chance.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's financial situation is dire. They can't afford vet bills, food, etc., and returning the dog might be a responsible decision to prevent future neglect. They tried to figure things out for a day but realized it's not feasible. The stepmom's allergy is another factor; they couldn't return it to their dad's home.\n\nThe father's reaction adds pressure, but the author's decision is based on their current capabilities. The key is whether the author is being selfish or practical. If they can't provide care, is returning it to a shelter a better option than keeping the dog in a neglectful environment? Also, the dog being returned twice might affect its chances, but the author didn't know that beforehand.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they're making a tough decision based on their circumstances to avoid long-term neglect. The father's judgment and the shelter's reaction are part of the conflict, but the author's intent was to do what they felt was right given their situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
