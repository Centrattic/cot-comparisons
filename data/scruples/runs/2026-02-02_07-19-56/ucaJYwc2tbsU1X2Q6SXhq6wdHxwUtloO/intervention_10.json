I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for returning the dog to the shelter. The author got the dog as a birthday present from their dad, but due to financial difficulties after losing their job and needing to pay off student loans, they couldn't afford the dog's care. They returned the dog to the shelter, which had already been returned twice before. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers judged them. The author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate based on the facts given. The key points here are the financial situation, the stepmom's allergies, and the dog's history. \n\nFirst, the author's reasons for returning the dog: financial instability, inability to afford vet bills, food, etc. They tried to figure it out for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of allergies. The shelter workers mentioned the dog has been returned twice, which complicates things, but the author made a choice they thought was responsible.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, taking on a pet is a long-term commitment. If someone can't provide for it, returning it might be necessary to prevent further neglect. However, the dog's history of being returned might mean it's harder to rehome, increasing the risk of euthanasia. The dad's reaction is harsh, but the author's decision was based on their current inability to care for the dog.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If someone can't care for a pet, it's better to return it to a shelter than to keep it in poor conditions. However, maybe they could have found other solutions, like fostering temporarily while job hunting, or seeking help from pet charities. But the author's situation is dire, and the stepmom's allergies make returning to the dad impossible.\n\nThe judgment from the shelter workers and the dad's anger might not reflect the author's intentions. The author's action was to ensure the dog isn't neglected, even though it's difficult emotionally. So, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because their decision was based on responsible care despite the circumstances. But some might argue that they should have found another way instead of returning the dog to the shelter again. However, without viable alternatives, returning might have been the best option. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
