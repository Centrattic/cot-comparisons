I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The situation involves the person getting a dog for their birthday, but due to financial issues, they returned it after a day. The dad is upset, and the person feels guilty.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The person lost their job, has student loans, can't afford vet bills and dog food. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized they couldn't care for it. The stepmom is allergic, so they couldn't return it to the dad. Returned the dog to the shelter, but the workers were judgmental because the dog had been returned twice before. The dad is angry, saying they're selfish and the dog might get put down.\n\nFirst, the person is trying to manage their own financial stress. They didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford. On the other hand, returning a dog that's been returned twice might mean it's hard to find a home again. The dad's anger is also part of the conflict here.\n\nI think the person's intention was to not take in a pet they couldn't care for, which is responsible. But the timing and the fact that the dog was already returned twice could make the situation more complex. However, the person didn't act out of malice; they had genuine financial constraints. The shelter's judgment is understandable, but the person's decision was based on their inability to care for the dog. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
