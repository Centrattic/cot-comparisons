I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by returning the dog they received as a birthday gift from their dad. The key points here are the financial situation, the dad's reaction, and the shelter workers' judgment.\n\nFirst, the author lost their job and is struggling financially. They mention not having enough money for themselves, let alone vet bills and other pet expenses. That's a valid concern because taking care of a pet requires a significant financial commitment. If they can't afford it, keeping the dog might not be responsible in the long run. \n\nThe author tried to figure out the finances for a day but realized it wasn't possible. They couldn't return the dog to their dad because the stepmom is allergic. So returning to the shelter was their only option. However, the shelter workers judged them, saying the dog has been returned twice and deserves a forever home. That adds to the guilt. \n\nThe dad is upset, calling the author selfish and a bad person. He suggests opening credit cards to \"figure it out,\" but that's not realistic advice. Financial hardship is a real issue, and using credit cards could lead to more debt. The author's decision might have been based on responsibility rather than selfishness, even if it felt harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they took on the responsibility of a pet but couldn't support it. On the other, they returned the dog to avoid neglect, which is actually responsible. The shelter might have the means to care for the dog, even if it's a difficult decision. \n\nSo considering all factors, the author's decision was based on their financial inability to care for the dog, which is a legitimate reason. They didn't abandon the dog but returned it to a place that can provide care. Therefore, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
