I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but they can't afford to take care of it right now because they're unemployed and have student loans. They returned the dog to the shelter after keeping it for a day. Their dad is angry, saying they're selfish and that the dog might get put down. They feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The person returned the dog because they couldn't provide proper care, which is a valid concern. You don't want to keep a pet if you can't support it. On the other hand, the dog had been returned to the shelter twice already, and maybe the shelter workers thought it needed a permanent home. The person didn't keep the dog for very long, which might reduce the harm, but the emotional impact on their dad is real.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part of pet ownership. If someone can't afford the costs, it's actually responsible to not take on the pet. However, the method of returning might matter. The person tried to figure out their finances but couldn't, so they had to return it. The stepmom's allergy is another factor\u2014maybe they couldn't rehome the dog themselves.\n\nBut the dad's reaction is harsh. He's blaming them for the dog's possible fate, but the person made a difficult decision to avoid neglecting the animal. The guilt the person feels shows they care about the dog's well-being. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? They made a tough choice due to financial constraints. They didn't want to neglect the dog. The shelter might have other options, but the person isn't to blame for the dog's situation. The dad's anger seems misplaced if the person acted in the dog's best interest. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
