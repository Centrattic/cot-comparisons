I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. Let's look at the situation.\n\nThe person received a dog as a birthday present from their dad. They love dogs but are in a tough financial situation\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans, can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day, realized they couldn't handle it financially, and returned it. Their stepmom is allergic, so they couldn't give it back to their dad. The shelter\u5de5\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458 were judgmental because the dog was returned twice before. The dad is angry, accusing them of being selfish and causing the dog to be put down.\n\nSo, the key points here are the person's financial inability to care for the dog, their decision to return it quickly, and the dad's reaction. The person didn't want to neglect the dog, which shows they considered the animal's well-being. However, the dog was already returned twice, so maybe the shelter has limited resources. But the person made a choice they thought was best for the dog and themselves given their circumstances.\n\nIs the person wrong? Well, they didn't keep the dog out of spite or neglect. They did it because they couldn't afford to care for it and didn't want to put the dog in a bad situation. The dad's anger and the shelter's judgment are reactions, but the person's actions seem to be based on practical limitations. They tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't feasible. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
