I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to the shelter. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author got a dog from their dad as a present. They love dogs, but their financial situation is terrible\u2014unemployed and paying off student loans. They couldn't afford the dog's needs, kept it for a day, and then returned it to the shelter because the stepmom is allergic. The shelter workers judged them, the dad is angry, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main points are financial inability, the dad's expectations, and the dog's history. The author's reasoning is that they can't provide proper care, but the dad and shelter think they should have found a way. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's a balance between responsibility and personal circumstances. Pets are a long-term commitment, and taking one when you can't afford it might be irresponsible. However, the author's financial situation is dire. They tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't possible. Also, the stepmom's allergy made keeping the dog at home impossible. \n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh\u2014calling the author selfish and blaming them for the dog's possible death. But the author's decision was based on their current limitations. Returning the dog quickly might be better than keeping it in a stressful environment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, taking on a pet without the means could be seen as irresponsible. On the other, they made a difficult decision to return it quickly rather than neglecting it. The dad's expectations might be unrealistic given the author's situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author made a responsible choice to return the dog when they realized they couldn't care for it properly. It's better to return it to the shelter than to keep it in a bad situation. The dad's anger is misplaced, and financial hardship is a valid reason."
