I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for returning a dog they got for their birthday. The situation is that they received a dog from their dad, but due to financial struggles after losing a job, they returned it to the shelter. The dad is upset, and they're feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person got a dog as a gift but couldn't afford to care for it. They tried to figure it out but had to return it. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is angry. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, taking on a pet is a big responsibility. If someone can't afford the costs, including vet bills, food, and other necessities, it's important to consider the animal's well-being. However, the person tried to find a solution for a day before deciding, which shows they considered the situation. They couldn't give the dog back to their stepmom because of allergies, so returning to the shelter was their only option.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also part of the scenario. He suggested opening new credit cards, which might not be realistic. The person's financial situation is dire, and taking on more debt could be harmful. The shelter workers might be judgmental, but the author's primary responsibility is to ensure the dog gets a proper home, not just keeping it if they can't afford it.\n\nThe author's guilt suggests they care about the dog's welfare. They didn't want to be in a position where they couldn't provide for it. Returning the dog to the shelter might lead to the dog being rehomed, even if there's a risk of euthanasia. But the alternative was keeping a dog they couldn't support, which would be worse for the animal.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author made a difficult decision based on their circumstances. They didn't act out of selfishness but out of necessity. The dad's anger might be coming from a place of not understanding the financial strain. So, is the author wrong? Probably not. They made a tough call to prioritize their financial reality and the dog's future, even though it was painful.\n"
