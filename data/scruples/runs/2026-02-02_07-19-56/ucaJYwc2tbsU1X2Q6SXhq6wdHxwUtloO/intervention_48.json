I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but they couldn't afford to take care of it because they lost their job and have financial issues. They returned the dog to the shelter after a day. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers also judged them because the dog had been returned twice before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They love dogs but can't afford the expenses. They didn't want to neglect the dog, so they returned it. That seems responsible, right? They didn't keep the dog if they couldn't provide for it. But then again, returning a pet so quickly might seem like giving up too easily. However, given their financial situation, it's understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the dad feels they're selfish and that they should have found a way to make it work, like using credit cards. But is that realistic? The author is already struggling financially. Using credit cards could lead to more debt, which isn't helpful. Also, the stepmom's allergies make giving the dog back to the dad impossible, so returning to the shelter was the only option. \n\nThe shelter workers mentioned the dog had been returned twice. Maybe the dog has a hard time finding a home, which adds to the guilt. But the author didn't know about the dog's history when they took it. They acted in what they believed was the best interest at the time. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could have found a temporary home or a rescue group. But the prompt says they tried to figure it out financially for a day. Maybe they didn't have enough time, but that's part of the dilemma. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions were based on their current financial constraints and the desire to not neglect the dog. While returning a pet can be seen as a last resort, the circumstances here are valid. The dad's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for making a tough decision based on their reality.\n"
