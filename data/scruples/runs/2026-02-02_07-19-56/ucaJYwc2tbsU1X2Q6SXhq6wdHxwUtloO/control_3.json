I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for returning a dog they got as a birthday gift to the shelter. The main points here are the financial struggles, the inability to care for the dog, and the family's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author lost their job and is dealing with student loans. They mention not having enough money for themselves, let alone for a dog's needs like food, vet bills, etc. They tried to figure out the finances but realized it wasn't possible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of the stepmom's allergies. So, they returned the dog to the shelter.\n\nThe shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before and should have a forever home. The dad is angry, calling the author selfish and a bad person, saying the dog might be put down. The author feels guilty but didn't want to have a pet they couldn't care for.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key factors are:\n\n1. The author's financial inability to care for the dog.\n2. The dog being returned to the shelter, possibly leading to euthanasia.\n3. The dad's anger and the stepmom's allergies.\n4. The author's intention to not be irresponsible.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, getting a pet is a long-term commitment. If the author couldn't afford it, taking one on could be seen as irresponsible. However, once they realized they couldn't care for it, returning the dog might be the responsible choice rather than leaving it in a bad situation. But the dog was already returned twice, so the shelter might have limited options, possibly leading to euthanasia, which adds to the guilt.\n\nThe dad's reaction is also a factor. However, the author's decision was based on their circumstances. The stepmom's allergies prevent returning to the dad, so the shelter was the only option. \n\nBut the author did take it home first, even for a day, which could be seen as taking on the responsibility. However, they quickly realized they couldn't handle it. The shelter workers' judgment is about the dog's repeated returns, but the author's situation is a valid reason for returning it.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. On one hand, not being able to provide care is a valid reason. On the other, the dog's welfare is a concern. But the author's intention was to not be unprepared, which is understandable. However, getting a dog as a gift when you can't afford it might be considered selfish, especially if they knew their financial situation beforehand.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they accepted the dog knowing they couldn't care for it, but they didn't know initially. They tried to figure it out but realized it wasn't possible. Returning it might be the right choice to prevent ongoing neglect. However, the dad's argument is that they should have found a way, like credit cards. But that's financially irresponsible, leading to more debt. \n\nIn the end, the author made a difficult decision based on their circumstances. They didn't want to neglect the dog, so returning it might be the right choice despite the guilt. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
