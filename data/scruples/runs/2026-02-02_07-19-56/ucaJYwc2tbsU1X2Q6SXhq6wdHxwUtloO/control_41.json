I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they returned a dog they got for their birthday to the shelter because they couldn't afford it. Their dad is upset, and the shelter workers judged them. The person feels guilty and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the person got a dog as a gift from their dad. They didn't ask for it, but since they love dogs, maybe they thought they could handle it. But then they lost their job and are struggling financially. They tried to keep the dog for a day but realized they couldn't afford vet bills, food, etc. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because the stepmom is allergic. So returning to the shelter was the only option.\n\nThe dad is angry, saying they're selfish and a bad person. The person is worried the dog might be put down. The key points here are financial inability and the dog being returned after being adopted twice before. The shelter workers felt the dog deserved a forever home, implying that being returned again isn't ideal.\n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the person might feel they took on a commitment they couldn't keep. However, they did take it back quickly, within a day, which might show they didn't want to keep the dog if they couldn't provide for it. The dad's reaction is harsh, saying they should have used credit cards, but that's not realistic advice if the person is already in financial trouble. Using credit cards more could lead to more debt, which isn't a good solution.\n\nThe person's priority is their own financial stability and paying off student loans. They didn't want to take on a pet they couldn't afford. While the dog's situation is sad, the person made a difficult decision based on their circumstances. They didn't ignore the problem but tried to find a solution when they realized it wasn't feasible.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? They didn't intend to keep the dog if they couldn't care for it. They tried to handle it as soon as possible. The dad's judgment seems unfair given the person's financial situation. The shelter workers' judgment is about the dog's history, but the person didn't know about it beforehand. \n\nTherefore, the person isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
