I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they received a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but due to financial issues, they returned the dog to the shelter. The dad is upset, and the shelter workers judged them. The person is feeling guilty and asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person lost their job and is struggling financially. They can't afford the dog's expenses. They tried to keep it for a day but realized it wasn't feasible. They couldn't give the dog back to their dad because of a stepmom's allergies. So they returned it to the shelter, which had already had the dog returned twice. The dad is angry, saying they're selfish and that the dog might be put down.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, returning a dog to a shelter can be seen as responsible if they can't care for it. Animals shouldn't be kept if you can't support them. On the other hand, the dog was a gift, and the dad might feel betrayed. The shelter workers' comment about the dog deserving a forever home adds pressure.\n\nBut the key points are the financial inability and the effort to find a solution. The person didn't keep the dog out of neglect but because they couldn't provide for it. The dad's reaction seems harsh, especially suggesting they should take on more debt. The person's guilt suggests they care about the dog's well-being.\n\nIn similar situations, people are often judged for not being able to care for a pet, but if they return it to a shelter to find a better home, it's seen as responsible. However, returning a dog multiple times could be an issue. Here, the dog was returned twice before, and the person did return it, possibly contributing to the dog's fate. But the person's intention was to avoid neglect, not to abandon the dog. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
