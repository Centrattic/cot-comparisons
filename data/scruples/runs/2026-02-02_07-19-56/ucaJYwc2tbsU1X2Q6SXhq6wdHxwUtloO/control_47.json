I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. The main points here are: the person received a dog as a birthday present from their dad, they're in a tough financial situation, couldn't afford the dog's needs, and couldn't return it to their stepmom because of allergies. They returned the dog to the shelter, which was already a returned dog twice, and now their dad is upset, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, the person's financial situation is a key factor. They lost their job and are dealing with student loans. They can't afford vet bills, food, etc. So, they had to make a practical decision based on their current resources. The guilt they feel suggests they care about the dog's well-being, which is important. \n\nThe dad's reaction is also part of this. He's angry, calling them selfish and saying they should have used credit cards. But is that a realistic solution for someone with financial instability? The person might not want to take on more debt, especially with job hunting and existing loans. \n\nThe dog was already returned twice before. The shelter workers judged them, implying the dog deserves a forever home. But if the person can't provide a stable home, maybe returning it is actually the responsible choice to prevent the dog from being neglected later. \n\nThe stepmom's allergy is another barrier. The person couldn't give the dog back to their dad, so returning to the shelter was the only option. They tried for a day to see if they could manage but realized it wasn't feasible. \n\nIs the person selfish for returning the dog? Or is it a responsible decision given their circumstances? The dad's advice to take on more debt might not be wise. The person isn't neglecting the dog once they realize they can't care for it. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually considers intentions and circumstances. The person's intentions were to avoid neglect, and they acted quickly once they realized they couldn't handle the responsibility. The dad's anger might stem from not understanding their financial situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the person isn't in the wrong. They made a tough decision based on their reality. The answer should be B.\n"
