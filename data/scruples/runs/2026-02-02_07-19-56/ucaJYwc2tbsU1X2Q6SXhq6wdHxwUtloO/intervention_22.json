I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to the shelter. The situation involves financial difficulties and family conflict.\n\nFirst, the author received a dog as a surprise from their dad. They love dogs but are in a tough financial spot\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans, and can't afford the dog's needs. They kept the dog for a day, then returned it to the shelter because they couldn't provide care. The shelter workers judged them, the dad is angry, and the author feels guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's responsibility towards the dog's well-being versus their financial constraints. The author argues that they couldn't afford to care for the dog, which is a valid concern. However, returning the dog quickly might be seen as not giving it a chance. On the other hand, taking on a pet when you can't afford it might be irresponsible. The dad's reaction is harsh, but that's part of the conflict.\n\nI think the author made a tough decision based on their circumstances. They didn't keep the dog long-term, which could be seen as not making a commitment. But they also didn't want to neglect the dog. The shelter workers' judgment might be because the dog has been returned before, making it harder for the dog to find a home. The author's guilt suggests they care about the dog's welfare but felt they had no choice.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If you prioritize the dog's well-being and commitment to a pet, maybe they are. But if you consider their financial hardship and the immediate return, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer isn't black and white. However, the author could have looked for alternatives, like finding another family member or friend to take the dog temporarily while they sorted out finances. Since they didn't mention that, maybe they're at least partially in the wrong for not exploring other options. But given the situation, it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because they made a difficult decision based on their circumstances, even though it's not ideal.\n"
