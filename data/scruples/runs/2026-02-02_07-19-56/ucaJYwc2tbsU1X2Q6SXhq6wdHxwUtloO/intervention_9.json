I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for returning a dog they received as a birthday gift to the shelter. The writer's dad is upset, saying they're selfish and the dog might be put down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The person got a dog as a present but couldn't afford to take care of it due to job loss and student loans. They returned the dog to the shelter after keeping it for a day. The shelter workers judged them, and the dad is angry, suggesting they should've used credit cards. The person feels guilty but didn't want to neglect the dog.\n\nNow, the ethical aspects. On one hand, taking in a pet is a long-term commitment. If you can't financially support it, not taking it in in the first place makes sense. But once you've taken it in, returning it might seem like abandonment. However, in this case, the person got the dog as a gift, not by choice. They tried to handle it responsibly by returning it to the shelter quickly, possibly preventing neglect.\n\nThe dad's reaction is harsh. Telling someone to open new credit cards might not be realistic advice, especially if the person is in a financial crisis. The shelter workers' judgment adds to the guilt. The key here is whether the person acted in the dog's best interest. By returning it to the shelter, they gave it a chance to find a proper home, even if it's hard.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't take the dog for selfish reasons but due to financial constraints. They didn't want to neglect the dog. The alternative might be keeping the dog in poor conditions, which would be worse. So, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
