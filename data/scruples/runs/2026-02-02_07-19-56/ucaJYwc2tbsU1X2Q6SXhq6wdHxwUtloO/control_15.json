I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog to the shelter is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the person got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad, but they're in a tough financial situation. They lost their job, have student loans, and can't afford the dog's needs. They kept it for a day and then returned it. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before, and the dad is angry, calling them selfish and saying the dog might get put down.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the person's financial situation and their decision-making. They didn't want to take on a responsibility they couldn't afford. The dad gave the dog as a surprise, so maybe they didn't consult each other beforehand. The person's stepmom is allergic, so returning the dog to the dad isn't an option. The shelter workers felt it was wrong because the dog was already returned twice. The dad is upset, but the person's reasoning is about financial inability.\n\nI need to consider if the person is in the wrong. On one hand, taking a pet is a long-term commitment, and getting a dog as a gift without discussing the responsibilities might have been a mistake. The person might have taken the dog without considering their financial stability. But on the other hand, the person is in a difficult financial situation, and they don't want to be in a position where they can't care for the dog. The shelter might be able to find a better home, even if the dog has been returned before. The guilt is real, but maybe they had to make a hard choice for the dog's well-being. So, is the person in the wrong? Or is the dad expecting them to take on financial strain they can't handle? Maybe the dad should have considered the responsibilities before giving a dog as a gift. The person acted quickly to return the dog to avoid neglect, which is better than keeping it and not being able to care for it. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
