I'm sorry if this sounds like a shitpost but I've genuinely been wracked with guilt over this.  \n\nMy birthday was at the end of January and my dad surprised me with a dog adopted from the shelter as a present. Don't get me wrong, I love dogs. However, my financial situation is awful right now. I lost my job a couple of months ago and I'm still trying to find a new one, and I'm also trying to pay off my student loans. I barely have money for myself right now, never mind for vet bills, food, toys, etc. I kept the dog for a day while trying to figure it out financially but I had to realize it just wasn't possible right now. I couldn't give the dog back to my dad because my stepmom is very allergic to dogs. I returned her to the shelter. First I got judgment from the workers there because apparently the dog has been returned twice and she deserves a forever home. My dad is also really mad at me for returning the dog. He told me I'm selfish, a bad person to be so cruel to an innocent animal, and that I should've opened new credit cards and just \"figured it out\". He told me the dog is probably going to get put down and it's all my fault. I feel absolutely horrible over this but I didn't want to have a pet I can't afford to take care of. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who returned the dog is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the person got a dog as a birthday gift from their dad. They love dogs but are in a tough financial situation\u2014unemployed, paying off student loans, can't afford vet bills, food, etc. They kept the dog for a day and then returned it to the shelter. The shelter workers judged them because the dog had been returned twice before and deserved a forever home. The dad is angry, calling them selfish and a bad person, suggesting they should have used credit cards to \"figure it out.\" The person is feeling guilty but didn't want to have a pet they couldn't care for. They're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the facts: The person is in a financial bind. They tried to take care of the dog but realized they couldn't. Returning the dog to the shelter might have been the responsible choice to prevent neglect. The shelter workers' judgment is a bit harsh since they already returned it once. The dad's reaction is also problematic\u2014he's pressuring them to take on more debt, which isn't responsible advice. The person's intention was to avoid being unable to care for the dog, which is a valid concern. \n\nBut the shelter workers might have other options, like finding another temporary home or resources. However, the person's decision to return the dog immediately due to inability to care for it is understandable. They didn't keep the dog for selfish reasons but out of practicality. The guilt they feel is genuine, but they aren't in the wrong for making a tough choice under financial stress. The father's anger and the shelter workers' judgment don't make the person wrong; the main issue is the circumstances they're in. So the answer is B.\n"
