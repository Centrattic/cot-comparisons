My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the older man) is in the wrong for dating a much younger woman. He's 73, his girlfriend is 20. The key points here are the age gap, the context of his wife passing away, and his need for companionship due to moving to a retirement home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Age differences can be a sensitive topic, especially when there's a significant gap. The woman is an adult, so legally, it's fine. But socially, some might view this as problematic because of the power dynamics or the perception of exploiting a younger person. However, the man mentions that she's his girlfriend, so it's a consensual relationship. \n\nHe also mentions that he's struggling after his wife's death and needs companionship. That's a personal hardship, and seeking comfort is understandable. The website he used is designed for older, wealthier men to connect with younger women, which might raise questions about the motivations involved. But as long as both parties are consenting adults, that's their choice. \n\nHowever, the part about the age difference being similar to his granddaughter's age is a red flag. Even though they're not related, the social taboo around such relationships can make people uncomfortable. The man might be aware of this and is questioning his own actions. \n\nI should also consider if there's any form of manipulation or coercion here. The prompt doesn't mention any, just that they've been dating for three months and things are going well. If the relationship is healthy and both are happy, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the power imbalance due to age and possibly wealth could be an issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the man is seeking validation and is trying to decide if he's an asshole. The subreddit's response might focus on the consensual nature versus societal judgment. Legally, there's no issue, but social acceptance varies. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the relationship is consensual and respectful. Since the woman is an adult and the man is acting out of genuine feelings (with no signs of exploitation), he might not be in the wrong. But the cultural norms and the perception matter too. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, not whether others might judge him. Since the relationship is consensual and there's no mention of harm, the answer might be B. But some might argue that the age gap creates an inherent imbalance, making him in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the law doesn't see it as wrong, and the relationship is consensual. Unless there's exploitation, which isn't mentioned, the answer is B. However, societal views might differ, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about social judgment. So, B.\n"
