My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for dating someone younger. The author is 73, his girlfriend is 20, which is a 53-year age gap. He's dealing with the loss of his wife and moving to a retirement home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, 20 is the age of consent, so legally, it's okay. But there's the social and ethical angle. The age gap is huge. The man is in his 70s, and the woman is a young adult. There's a question of whether this is exploitative. Older men dating much younger women can sometimes be seen as taking advantage of the younger person's vulnerability or using their resources. The author mentions a site that connects younger girls with older, wealthier guys, which might imply a transactional element. But he says they've been dating for three months and things are going well. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author is grieving, so maybe he's seeking comfort. The fact that his family isn't aware might matter. If the girlfriend is aware and consenting, maybe it's not his fault. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the comparison to his granddaughter's age. Dating someone close to a grandchild's age can make others uncomfortable, even if there's no relation. But legally and consensually, it's okay. However, people might judge him for the age difference. \n\nI need to balance legality with social norms. If the woman isn't under any legal age and is consenting, then maybe he isn't in the wrong. But if there's a power imbalance or if the relationship is exploitative, then he could be. The site he's using might be a red flag if it's about wealth and not mutual emotional connection. \n\nAlso, considering his situation\u2014recent loss and moving to a retirement home\u2014it's possible he's lonely and seeking companionship. But that doesn't excuse a potentially problematic age gap unless both parties are genuinely happy. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the relationship is consensual and not exploitative. Since the post doesn't mention any coercion or non-consent, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that the age gap is too large regardless. But without more info on exploitation, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. So maybe answer B (not in the wrong) because it's consensual and legal, even if socially questionable.\n"
