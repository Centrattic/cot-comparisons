My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's 73 and dating a 20-year-old. He's a widower, his wife died of cancer, and he's struggling with loneliness. He found a website that connects older, wealthier guys with younger girls. Now he's feeling uneasy because the age gap is similar to his granddaughter's age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so 20 is above that. So legally, there's no issue. But legally right doesn't always mean morally right. \n\nThen there's the age gap. 73 vs. 20 is a 53-year difference. That's a huge gap. Some might argue that such a large gap can create power imbalances, especially if one is significantly older and perhaps wealthier. The author mentions the website is for older, wealthier guys with younger girls. That might imply economic factors, which could be problematic if the younger person is in it for money. But the user says his relationship is going well, so maybe that's not the case here. \n\nHe also mentions that he's approaching the need for a retirement home, which might mean he's in a vulnerable situation. If the younger partner is taking advantage of his situation for financial gain, that's unethical. But the user hasn't provided that information; he's just sharing his feelings of unease.\n\nAnother angle is the family reaction. He hasn't told his family yet. Maybe they'd disapprove, but that's their opinion. The question is about whether he's in the wrong, not if his family will be upset. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the woman's age. Since she's 20, she's in her early twenties, which is young. Some might argue that a 20-year-old is still in a formative period of life, and an older partner might influence that. But again, if the relationship is consensual and she's not being coerced, it's a personal choice. \n\nThe author is feeling conflicted because the girl is about the same age as his granddaughter. That comparison might be making him uncomfortable. There's a psychological aspect here; relationships with someone the age of a grandchild can feel inappropriate, even if legally okay. \n\nBut is it his fault? He's trying to cope with loneliness after losing his wife. It's a personal choice, and as long as both parties are consenting adults, it's their business. However, if there's a power dynamic or exploitation, that's different. The story doesn't indicate exploitation, just a consensual relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the relationship is exploitative. Since the user hasn't mentioned any exploitation and says things are going well, maybe he's not in the wrong. But some might still argue the age gap itself is problematic regardless of consent. However, legally and in terms of consent, it's not wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but there's a lot of nuance here.\n"
