My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating someone much younger. The person is 73, the girlfriend is 20. The age difference is 53 years. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's wife died recently, so he's dealing with grief. He's also in a situation where he might need to go to a retirement home, so maybe he's feeling isolated. He tried dating people his age but found it hard to leave the house. So he used a site that connects older guys with younger girls. The girlfriend is 20, which is the same age as his granddaughter, which makes him uneasy.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, as long as both parties are of age, it's consensual. The girl is 20, so she's an adult. But age gaps can raise ethical questions. The main issue here might be the power dynamic. The author mentions being older, wealthier, and in a position where he might have more influence or resources. There's also the aspect of the girl being the same age as his granddaughter, which could make it feel awkward or inappropriate to some people.\n\nBut the author's intent is important. He says they've been dating for three months and things are going well. He hasn't told his family yet. The key points are: both adults, consensual, no coercion mentioned. However, some might argue that a 53-year age gap is problematic regardless of legal aspects. Also, the context of using a site designed for such pairings might imply that the relationship is transactional or based on wealth, which could be seen as exploitative if the younger person isn't entering it on equal terms.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship is genuine and both are happy, then it's a matter of personal choice. The author is seeking validation, not just for himself but maybe for how society perceives his actions. The subreddit is for \"Am I the Asshole\" so the community usually looks at intentions and harm done.\n\nAre there any signs of harm here? The author mentions feeling uneasy, but no harm to the girlfriend. If she's entering into the relationship willingly and there's no manipulation, then it's hard to say he's the asshole. But the age difference is so large that some might see it as inherently unethical, especially given the power imbalance in age and life stage.\n\nI think the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong, because it's legal and consensual, but there's a strong argument for A because of the ethical concerns. However, since the site is designed for such pairings, maybe the author isn't doing anything wrong. But I need to be careful. The subreddit often considers societal norms and potential for exploitation. If the relationship is healthy and both are okay, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if there's a power dynamic, maybe he is. The answer might depend on whether the relationship is exploitative. Since the scenario doesn't mention any exploitation, just a large age gap, the answer might be B.\n"
