My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for dating someone younger. The person is 73, the girlfriend is 20. He's a widower, dealing with loss, and trying to find companionship. The age gap is 53 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so 20 is above that. So legally, there's no issue. But socially, a 50+ year age gap can be a big red flag. People often frown upon such large gaps because of power dynamics, life stages, and potential exploitation. The man is older, maybe wealthier, which could be a concern if the relationship isn't equal.\n\nHe mentioned using a website designed to connect older guys with younger girls, which might imply a transactional aspect. If he's using his wealth to attract her, that could be problematic. But he also says they've been dating for three months and things are going well. Maybe it's genuine, but it's hard to tell from his description.\n\nHe feels uneasy because she's the same age as his granddaughter. That's a common concern, as people might question if it's appropriate given his family context. However, age isn't the only factor. If both are consenting adults and the relationship is healthy, then it's up to them. But others might judge him for not considering the social implications or the potential for a lopsided relationship.\n\nAlso, his reason for using the site\u2014because dating his peers is hard\u2014might indicate he's seeking companionship in a way that's accessible to him. But the choice of partner's age is what's in question. The key here is whether the relationship is consensual, respectful, and not exploitative. If both are happy and there's no coercion, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But societal norms often criticize such age gaps, especially when one partner is significantly older and possibly in a position of power.\n\nIn conclusion, while legally okay, socially it's a gray area. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the dynamics of the relationship. If it's healthy and consensual, maybe not. But the potential for exploitation exists, which could make him wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the relationship is respectful, but A if there's underlying exploitation. Since the scenario doesn't show exploitation, maybe B is the answer. But the large age gap and the context of using a site for \"younger girls with older, wealthier guys\" might suggest A. Hmm.\n"
