My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's 73, his wife just died, and he's been dating a 20-year-old. He feels uneasy because the age gap is big, especially since she's about the same age as his granddaughter. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so 20 is definitely above that. So legally, he's not breaking any laws. But maybe there's a social or ethical question here. The age difference is 53 years, which is a huge gap. People often frown upon such large age gaps, especially when one person is significantly older and the other is young. \n\nHe mentioned that he used a site designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. That makes me think about the power dynamics here. If the older person is wealthier, there's a risk of the younger person being in the relationship for financial reasons. The author might be taking advantage of her, even if he doesn't realize it. \n\nHe's also in a vulnerable state emotionally after his wife's death. He might be seeking comfort and companionship, which is understandable, but entering a new relationship so soon after a spouse's death could be seen as not giving himself enough time to grieve properly. \n\nAnother angle is the family aspect. His family might be uncomfortable with this because she's similar in age to his granddaughter. Families often have concerns when there's a significant age gap, especially if the older person is in a different life stage. \n\nHowever, the author is being honest about his feelings and is seeking advice, which shows some self-awareness. He hasn't told his family yet, which might indicate he's aware of potential backlash. \n\nI should also consider consent and mutual respect. If the relationship is consensual and both are entering it freely without coercion, then that's a positive. But if there's an imbalance in power or age, it could still be problematic. \n\nIn many cultures, such a large age gap is controversial. The younger person's maturity level compared to the older one is a factor. At 20, she's still young and might not fully understand the long-term implications of a relationship with someone nearing retirement age. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the older person's health and future. The author mentions needing a retirement home, which could mean his health is declining. A 20-year-old might not be prepared for the challenges that come with that. \n\nSo putting it all together, while it's legal and the author is seeking advice, the ethical considerations around power dynamics, potential exploitation, and the appropriateness given his recent loss and the age similarity to his granddaughter make me think he might be in the wrong. But I need to be careful not to judge based on personal biases. The answer probably hinges on whether the relationship is consensual and respectful, but the circumstances raise red flags that suggest he might be.\n"
