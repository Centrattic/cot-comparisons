My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong by dating someone 20 years younger. The author is 73, his wife recently passed away, and he's finding it hard to cope. He's been using a site that connects older, wealthier men with younger women. His girlfriend is 20, the same age as his granddaughter, which makes him feel uneasy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Age-gap relationships are a common topic in these forums. The main issues usually revolve around consent, power dynamics, and societal norms. The author is in his 70s, and the woman is 20, which is a significant age difference. \n\nIn many places, the legal age of consent is around 16-18, so 20 is definitely above that. However, the age gap here is 53 years. Some people might argue that the older person has more life experience and possibly a power imbalance. But if both parties are consenting adults, that's a point in favor of the relationship being okay. \n\nThe author mentions using a site specifically designed for connecting older men with younger women, which might imply that the platform's intent isn't entirely benign. But again, if both are entering the relationship willingly, maybe that's not the issue. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The author is grieving and looking for companionship. It's understandable, but some might see it as exploiting a younger person's needs for emotional support. However, if the relationship is healthy and mutual, that's different. \n\nThe author feels uneasy because the girlfriend's age is similar to his granddaughter. That could create complications if they interact in other family contexts, but if they're separate, maybe it's not an issue. However, the fact that the author hasn't told his family yet might indicate some underlying concern about how they would react, which could be valid or not.\n\nLegally, as long as it's consensual and both adults, it's not illegal. But socially, opinions vary. Some might say the age gap is too large, others might not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, which depends on ethical considerations. If there's no coercion, if both are happy and consenting, then maybe not. But if there's an imbalance where the older person is taking advantage, then yes. The scenario doesn't mention any exploitation, just mutual dating. \n\nSo, based on the information given, if the relationship is consensual and both are adults, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But some people might still judge him due to the age gap. The answer could be B, but I need to make sure. The AITA context often looks at social acceptability too. However, the subreddit often sides with the person if there's no harm or exploitation. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
