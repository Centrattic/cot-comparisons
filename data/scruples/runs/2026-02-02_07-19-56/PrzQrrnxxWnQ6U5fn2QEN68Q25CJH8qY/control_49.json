My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the 73-year-old man is in the wrong for dating a 20-year-old, which is a 53-year age gap. That's a huge difference. First, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so legally, as long as she's 18 or older, it's not illegal. But there's more to it than that.\n\nThe man mentions his wife recently passed away, and he's struggling. He's in a retirement home situation, and dating someone his age is hard. The woman he's dating is on a site for younger girls to connect with older, wealthier men. That raises some red flags. The fact that she's the same age as his granddaughter adds to the discomfort. \n\nAge-gap relationships can be controversial, especially when there's a significant power imbalance. The older person might have more resources, which can affect the relationship's dynamics. The man hasn't told his family yet, which suggests he might feel guilt or shame. \n\nEthically, the key points are consent and mutual respect. If both are consenting adults and the relationship is healthy, then it's not inherently wrong. But the context of her joining a site targeting older, wealthier men might imply she's there for financial reasons rather than emotional connection. That could make the relationship transactional, which is a problem. Also, the emotional state of the man\u2014grieving and vulnerable\u2014might make him more susceptible to being taken advantage of. \n\nHowever, if the relationship is genuinely mutual and the woman is not exploiting him, then maybe it's okay. But the setup does give some clues that might suggest otherwise. The age difference could also affect how the relationship is perceived by others, which is part of the man's own feelings of unease. \n\nIn summary, while it's legal, the ethical considerations depend on the nature of the relationship. If it's consensual and healthy, then maybe not in the wrong. But given the circumstances and the potential for exploitation, it's a gray area. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the answer hinges on the context provided. The key factors are consent, the woman's intentions, and the man's vulnerability. Since the story suggests she's on a site for older, wealthier men, there's an implication of financial motives. That could make the man a victim of manipulation. So, the answer would lean towards A (he's in the wrong) if the relationship is based on unequal power dynamics. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if it's consensual. The question is whether he's the asshole, and the subreddit often looks at intent and harm. If there's no harm and it's mutual, maybe B. But the setup of the site and the age difference with his granddaughter might make others think he's the asshole. The final answer would be A.\n"
