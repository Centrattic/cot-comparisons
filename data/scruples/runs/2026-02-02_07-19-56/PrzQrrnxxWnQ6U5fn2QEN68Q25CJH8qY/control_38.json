My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for dating someone much younger. The author is 73, and his girlfriend is 20. The age difference is 53 years. Hmm. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent varies, but 20 is typically above the legal age. So, there's no legal issue here. That means it's not a matter of breaking the law.\n\nNext, social norms. A 20-year-old is in her early adulthood, while the author is in his early 70s. The age gap is significant. Some people might view this as problematic because of the potential power dynamics. The author mentions he's older and possibly wealthier, which could create an imbalance. The girlfriend might be influenced by his resources rather than being in the relationship for other reasons. But the post says they've been dating for three months and things are going well. If both are consenting adults, that's a key point.\n\nEmotional and relational aspects. The author recently lost his wife, so he's dealing with grief. Dating again after loss is a personal choice. However, the fact that his granddaughter is around the same age as his girlfriend might cause family tensions. The author hasn't told his family yet, which could lead to conflict if revealed. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not about his family's reaction.\n\nMoral judgment. The main issue here is whether the age gap itself makes it wrong. If both people are adults, capable of making their own decisions, and the relationship is consensual, then from a strict standpoint, maybe not. However, societal views can vary widely. Some might argue that the older person should consider the younger one's long-term well-being, given the life stages involved. For example, the 20-year-old is likely in the phase of building her career, education, or other life goals, while the 73-year-old is nearing retirement. There might be concerns about the sustainability of the relationship or if it's a fair dynamic.\n\nThe author's own feelings of unease are mentioned. He's questioning his actions, which shows internal conflict. But that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong; it just means he's aware of potential societal judgments.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, it's allowed. If both are consenting adults, there's no inherent wrong in the age difference. However, societal and personal values can influence perceptions. The author's intentions and the nature of the relationship matter. If it's a healthy, consensual relationship without coercion, then B (not in the wrong) might be the answer. But if there's any element of manipulation or the younger partner isn't acting of her own free will, then A. Since the post doesn't mention any coercion, and the girlfriend is an adult, the likely answer is B.\n"
