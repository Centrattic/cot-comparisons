My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 73-year-old man who's recently lost his wife and is considering moving into a retirement home. He started dating a 20-year-old after trying to date people his age but found it difficult. He's feeling uneasy because his girlfriend is around the same age as his granddaughter.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent is a factor. In most places, 20 is above the age of consent, so there's no legal issue here. But the age gap is significant\u201453 years. That's a big difference. The man is in a stage where he's dealing with loss and possibly needing more support. The girl, being 20, is likely in the early stages of her life, building her career or education. \n\nThere's also the aspect of his family not knowing yet. He's hesitant to share this, which might indicate he's aware of potential family disapproval. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The subreddit usually looks at intentions and harm. If both parties are consenting adults, it's mostly a matter of social judgment. However, power dynamics could be an issue if the older person is in a position of authority or influence over the younger. Here, he's older but not necessarily in a position of power unless it's financial or otherwise. The site he used is for connecting younger girls with older, wealthier men, which does raise questions about whether there's an imbalance in the relationship. \n\nAlso, the man is in a vulnerable state emotionally, which might affect his judgment. But the key point is mutual consent. If both are entering into the relationship freely and there's no exploitation, then from a legal standpoint, it's okay. Socially, people might have opinions, but the subreddit often considers personal happiness and autonomy. However, the subreddit's guidelines might also look at whether the author is causing harm to others. Since he hasn't mentioned any harm to the girl or others, and it's a consensual relationship, the answer might lean towards B. But some might argue that the age gap is too large and could lead to issues in the future, or that the girl might be taking advantage of his emotional state. However, without evidence of manipulation or harm, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. The subreddit's community usually emphasizes personal choice unless there's exploitation. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
