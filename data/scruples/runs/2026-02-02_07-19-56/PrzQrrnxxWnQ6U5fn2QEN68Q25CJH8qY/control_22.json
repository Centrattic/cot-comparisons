My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating someone much younger. The situation is a 73-year-old man who's recently lost his wife and is dealing with the challenges of aging. He's dating a 20-year-old after finding a website that connects older guys with younger girls. He's feeling uneasy because his granddaughter is around the same age as his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The age difference is significant\u201453 years. Generally, society has some concerns about large age gaps, especially when one party is in a much more vulnerable position. In this case, the woman is 20, which is the age of majority in many places, so legally she's an adult. But there's also the aspect of life experience and power dynamics. The man is older, wealthier, and in a retirement home situation, which might mean he's in a position of authority or influence over her.\n\nThen there's the context of the website he used. If the site is designed to connect older, wealthier men with younger women, that could imply transactional or even predatory motivations. That raises ethical questions about the nature of the relationship. Is it based on mutual affection, or is it more about financial benefits for the woman?\n\nThe author's hesitation about talking to his family suggests he's aware of potential social disapproval. His granddaughter's age being similar adds a layer of discomfort because it's a taboo to date someone who's like family. Even though legally there's no issue, socially it's frowned upon.\n\nAlso, considering the woman's age, she might be in a different life stage. At 20, she might not have the same life experience as a 73-year-old, which could lead to challenges in the relationship. There's a risk of the relationship being imbalanced, with the older partner having more life experience and possibly using influence or money in a way that could be coercive.\n\nHowever, if the relationship is consensual and both parties are happy, some might argue it's their choice. But the ethical aspect here is murky. The power imbalance, the age gap, and the context of the website all contribute to the perception that the author might be in the wrong, even if there's no legal fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the significant age gap, the potential for exploitation given the power dynamics, and the use of a site that targets such relationships. Even if the relationship is consensual, the ethical concerns around the circumstances make the author's actions questionable.\n"
