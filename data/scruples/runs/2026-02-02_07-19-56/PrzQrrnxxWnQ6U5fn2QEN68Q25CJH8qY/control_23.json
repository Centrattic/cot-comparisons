My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 73-year-old man who lost his wife and is struggling with loneliness. He's dating a 20-year-old girl, which is a 53-year age gap. He's concerned because she's around the age of his granddaughter. The main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of consent laws. In most places, 20 is above the age of consent, so legally, there's no issue. But the age gap is significant. Some people might see it as problematic due to the power dynamics. The older person might have more life experience, financial stability, which could affect the relationship's balance. The user mentions he uses a site that connects older, wealthier guys with younger girls, which adds a layer of potential exploitation, even if unintentional.\n\nEmotionally, the user is dealing with grief and loneliness. That's a valid reason for seeking companionship, but the choice of partner might affect his family's perception. The fact that the girl is close in age to his granddaughter might cause family tension if they find out. The user hasn't told his family yet, which is understandable if he's worried about their reaction.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the relationship is consensual and respectful. If both parties are okay with it and no one is being harmed, then it's a matter of personal choice. But societal norms often frown upon large age gaps, especially when one is much older. The user's use of a site that specifically targets this dynamic might make some people think he's exploiting the younger person for his own benefit, possibly for companionship or financial reasons.\n\nHowever, there's no evidence here that the relationship is non-consensual or exploitative. The user says things are going well, so maybe they're both happy. But the perception from others, including the family, could be negative. The user is conflicted, which is why he's seeking opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the relationship might be consensual and legal, the significant age gap and potential power imbalance could make him an asshole in the eyes of others. But if both are happy and it's respectful, then maybe not. The key factors are consent, mutual respect, and whether there's any exploitation involved. Since the scenario here doesn't mention coercion or harm, it's a bit of a gray area. However, given the context of a site that pairs older, wealthier men with younger women, some might view it as transactional, which could taint the relationship's legitimacy. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the potential for exploitation and the large age gap, even if there's no explicit wrongdoing.\n"
