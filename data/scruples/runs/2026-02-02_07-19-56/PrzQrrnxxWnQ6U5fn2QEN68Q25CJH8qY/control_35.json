My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a 73-year-old man who's been dating a 20-year-old woman for three months. He's going through a tough time after his wife passed away, and he's struggling with daily activities, maybe considering a retirement home. He tried dating people his age but found it hard to leave the house, so he turned to a website that connects older, wealthier men with younger women. Now he's feeling uneasy because his girlfriend is about the same age as his granddaughter, and he hasn't told his family yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. The age gap is 53 years. That's a huge difference. In many places, the legal age of consent is 18, so 20 is above that. But the issue here isn't about legality\u2014it's about morality and social norms. The user is asking if he's an asshole for dating someone that much younger.\n\nHe's in a vulnerable position: recently widowed, older, possibly lonely. The fact that he's using a service designed to connect older men with younger women might be seen as taking advantage of the age gap. The woman is 20, which is right at the start of adulthood. There's a concern that someone in their early 20s might not have the same life experience or understanding as someone in their 70s, which could lead to an unequal power dynamic. Also, the fact that he mentions the website's purpose implies that the relationship might be transactional, which could be problematic if the woman is there for financial reasons rather than genuine emotional connection.\n\nHowever, if the relationship is consensual and both parties are happy, some might argue that it's their choice. But the key points are the significant age gap and the potential for exploitation. Since he's older, wealthier, and there's a service that facilitates such relationships, there's an implication that the younger person might be seeking financial security or something else the older man can provide. This can lead to questions about whether the younger person is in a position of power imbalance, even if it's consensual.\n\nAdditionally, the man's own acknowledgment that his girlfriend is the same age as his granddaughter adds another layer. It's possible that this makes him uncomfortable because of societal norms about generational boundaries and family relationships. If he's not open about it with his family, there might be issues about transparency and how he's handling this new chapter in his life.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, it's okay. Morally, there are concerns about power dynamics, potential exploitation, and the nature of the relationship given the age difference. The fact that the website is designed for such pairings might indicate that the relationship is based on financial incentives rather than equality. Therefore, many people might see this as the author being in the wrong due to the significant age gap and the context of the relationship.\n"
