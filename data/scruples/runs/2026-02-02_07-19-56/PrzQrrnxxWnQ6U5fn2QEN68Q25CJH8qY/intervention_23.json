My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for dating someone younger. Let's start by looking at the details given. The person is 73 years old, his wife recently passed away from cancer, and he's approaching the age where he might need to go into a retirement home. He tried dating people his age but found it difficult to leave the house, so he used a website that connects older, wealthier men with younger women. His current girlfriend is 20 years old, and he's feeling uneasy because she's about the same age as his granddaughter. He hasn't told his family yet and is asking if he's an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so a 20-year-old is legally an adult. That means there's no legal issue here. But legality isn't the only factor. Then there's the emotional and psychological side. The man is in a vulnerable position, grieving the loss of his wife, and seeking companionship. The age gap is significant\u201453 years. This could raise questions about power dynamics, especially if the younger partner is perceived to be taking advantage of his financial status. The website he used is designed for older men to connect with younger women, which might imply a transactional aspect, though the user mentions they've been dating for three months and things are going well. \n\nAnother angle is the comparison to his granddaughter. Even though the girlfriend isn't related, the age similarity to his granddaughter might create uncomfortable situations, especially if they interact with family. It's possible that his family could feel uneasy or concerned about the relationship. The author hasn't told his family yet, which might indicate he's aware of potential disapproval.\n\nEthically, some might argue that a 20-year-old is at a stage in life where they're forming their own identity, and being in a relationship with someone significantly older could limit their opportunities or lead to dependency. However, if the relationship is consensual and both parties are happy, others might see it as their personal choice. The key here is whether there's any coercion or exploitation. The author mentions that they're dating and things are going well, so if it's mutual and consensual, some might say it's none of other people's business. \n\nOn the other hand, the power imbalance due to age and wealth could be problematic. The younger partner might not have the same life experience, which could affect the relationship's dynamics. The author's situation of being isolated after his wife's death might make him more susceptible to seeking comfort in a relationship that isn't balanced. Also, the fact that he used a specific site targeting wealthier older men with younger women might imply that the relationship has a transactional element, which could be viewed negatively.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer hinges on whether the relationship is consensual and if there's any exploitation. If both are entering the relationship willingly without coercion, then it's a personal choice. However, the significant age gap and potential power dynamics might lead some to think the author is in the wrong. Others might prioritize the individual's right to seek companionship after loss. Without knowing more about the specific circumstances, like if the girlfriend is financially dependent or if there's any manipulation involved, it's hard to say definitively. But given the information, the author's actions are legally okay, but ethically, there's room for debate. Since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, considering societal norms and potential exploitation, I might lean towards A (yes, in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the relationship is healthy and consensual, maybe B (not in the wrong). The question is subjective, but many people might frown upon it due to the age difference and possible power imbalance. So I'll go with A.\n"
