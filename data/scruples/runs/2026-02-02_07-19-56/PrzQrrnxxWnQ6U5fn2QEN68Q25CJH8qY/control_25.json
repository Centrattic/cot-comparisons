My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating someone 20 years old when he's 73. So, the age gap is 53 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most countries, the age of consent is around 16-18, so a 20-year-old is definitely above that. So legally, it's okay. But maybe there are specific laws about age differences in some places. But the user didn't mention location, so maybe it's a general case.\n\nThen there's the ethical aspect. The author's granddaughter is around the same age as the girlfriend. The user hasn't told his family yet, which might be a point of concern. But the key here is whether the relationship is consensual and healthy. The author mentions that things are going great, and the girlfriend is an adult. If both parties are consenting adults, then ethically, it's their choice. However, there's a potential for power imbalance because of the age and life experience gap. The older person might be in a position of influence, which could be problematic if there's any coercion or manipulation. The author mentions the website is for connecting younger girls with older, wealthier guys, which might imply that there's an element of financial exchange or expectation. That could be a red flag if the younger person is being taken advantage of.\n\nThe author's personal situation: his wife recently died, he's entering a retirement home, and he's feeling isolated. It's understandable he's seeking companionship. But the discomfort comes from the age gap relative to his granddaughter. That's a common concern because of the potential for family disapproval. But the relationship itself isn't inherently wrong if both are consenting and there's no exploitation.\n\nSo, the main issues are consent and exploitation. If the 20-year-old is not being taken advantage of financially or emotionally, and the relationship is mutual, then the author isn't wrong. But if there's an element of using the woman's youth for the author's benefit without her genuine consent, then it's wrong. The problem is the question doesn't provide enough info on whether there's coercion or if the relationship is purely based on mutual affection. The mention of the website's purpose might suggest that there's some transactional aspect, which could be problematic if the woman is there for financial reasons rather than genuine interest in a relationship.\n\nBut the author says he hasn't opened up to his family yet, which might indicate some internal conflict, but not necessarily wrongdoing. The key is whether the relationship is healthy and consensual. Without evidence of exploitation, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. However, the age gap being so large does raise ethical questions regardless of legality. Some people might find it inappropriate regardless of consent because of the power dynamics and the potential for the younger person to be influenced by the older person's resources.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong if the relationship is consensual and healthy. But if there's a power dynamic where the older person is taking advantage, then he is. Since the scenario doesn't provide clear evidence of exploitation, the default would be to say he's not in the wrong unless there's more to it. But the subreddit often leans toward considering the larger age gaps as problematic even if legal. However, the standard answer would be B for No, as both are adults and the relationship is consensual unless proven otherwise.\n"
