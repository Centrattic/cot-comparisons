My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 73-year-old man is dating a 20-year-old woman. He's been through a lot, his wife passed away, he's moving to a retirement home, and he's found this younger partner. The key issue here is the age gap and whether that makes him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The age of consent in most places is around 16-18, so 20 is definitely above that. So legally, there's no problem. But socially, there's a big age difference. The man is 53 years older than the woman. That's a significant gap. People might question the power dynamics here. He mentions that the woman is part of a service that connects older, wealthier men with younger women. That could imply a transactional relationship, which might raise ethical concerns. But the user says they've been dating for three months and things are going well. \n\nHe's also feeling uneasy because the girl is the same age as his granddaughter. That's a common concern; people might perceive it as akin to a grandparent-grandchild relationship, which can be taboo even if it's not the case. However, he's not the grandfather of this specific girl, just that her age matches his granddaughter's. \n\nHe hasn't told his family yet, which might add to the tension if they find out. But he's seeking validation. The question is whether he's an asshole. The term \"asshole\" here is usually about whether he's being inconsiderate or violating social norms without justification. \n\nConsidering his circumstances: grief, difficulty leaving the house, looking for companionship. These are valid reasons. But the age gap is huge. Some might say that using a service designed for such pairings isn't inherently wrong, but others might see it as exploitative. The woman's motivations could matter too\u2014does she genuinely like him, or is there an ulterior motive? Since he's not providing specifics, we don't know. \n\nThe user's guilt comes from the age comparison to his granddaughter and the societal judgment. But unless there's evidence of exploitation, coercion, or harm, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. It's a matter of personal choice and societal norms. In some cultures, large age gaps are more accepted. However, in many Western societies, there's a stigma, but it's not always considered \"asshole\" territory unless there's something unethical involved. \n\nSo, legally and ethically, unless there's exploitation, the answer might lean towards B (not an asshole). But some might argue that the power imbalance is inherent and that he's using a service that could be seen as transactional, making him A. However, without more info on the relationship's nature, it's hard to say. The subreddit typically goes by societal norms. If most people on AITA consider the age gap as a red flag, then A. If they see his situation as a valid reason, then B. Since the woman is 20 and he's 73, it's a 53-year gap. That's a typical red flag in AITA forums. So likely A. Wait, but some might argue it's his life and personal choice. Hmm. The answer might be A because of the significant age difference and potential exploitation, but others might say it's his choice. However, the term \"asshole\" in AITA isn't just about personal choice but whether the person is violating social norms in a harmful way. Given the age gap and the service he used, it's possible the community would lean towards A. But I'm a bit torn because he's seeking companionship after loss. Still, the age difference is so big. I think the answer is A.\n"
