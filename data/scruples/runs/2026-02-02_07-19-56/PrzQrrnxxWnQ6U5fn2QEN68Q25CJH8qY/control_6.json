My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The scenario is that a 73-year-old guy, recently widowed, is dating a 20-year-old. He feels uneasy because she's the same age as his granddaughter and hasn't told his family yet. The question is whether he's an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. A 53-year age gap is huge. In many places, there are laws about the age of consent, but 20 is above the legal age in most countries, so legally it's okay. But socially, such a large gap can be controversial. People often frown upon relationships where one person is significantly younger and the other is much older, especially if the older person is in a position of power or influence. Here, the man is older, maybe wealthier, and using a site that connects \"younger girls with older, wealthier guys.\" That might suggest a transactional aspect, which could be problematic if it's perceived as exploiting the young woman.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. He's recently lost his wife, so he's vulnerable. He's also facing moving to a retirement home, so maybe his social circle is shrinking. But dating someone so much younger could be seen as taking advantage of her youth, maybe for companionship or financial reasons. The fact that he hasn't told his family yet adds another layer. Family reactions might be strong, but that doesn't necessarily make him wrong, but it's a point to consider.\n\nThe woman's age is around his granddaughter's age. Grandparents dating someone the age of their grandchild is a red flag for many people. It can feel creepy, even if it's consensual. People might worry about power imbalances, especially if he's older and potentially has more resources. But if the relationship is genuinely consensual and both parties are happy, some might argue it's not his fault.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using a site designed for such pairings could imply that the dynamic is intentional. Some might see it as predatory, while others might see it as just two people finding companionship. The key here is mutual consent and whether there's any exploitation involved. If the woman is entering the relationship for his money or status, that's different. But if it's about emotional support and both are benefitting, then maybe it's okay.\n\nHowever, societal norms play a big role. Even if it's legal and consensual, public perception might label him as an asshole because of the age difference. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, which is a moral question, not just legal. So considering the age gap, the potential for exploitation, and the social stigma, it's possible that the community might side with him being in the wrong (A) because of the significant age difference and the context of his using a site that targets such relationships. Alternatively, if there's no coercion and both are happy, maybe not (B). But given the factors, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
