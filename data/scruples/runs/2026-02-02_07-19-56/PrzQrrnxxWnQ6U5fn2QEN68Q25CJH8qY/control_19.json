My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating someone much younger. The author is 73, and his girlfriend is 20, which is a 53-year age gap. That's a huge difference. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of consent. In most places, 20 is above the age of consent, so legally there's no issue. But then there's the social aspect. The author mentions that his granddaughter is around the same age as his girlfriend, which makes him feel uneasy. That's a common concern because people often compare the younger person's age to their own family members.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend isn't related to him, right? The problem here is more about societal norms and potential family reactions. The author is in a difficult life stage, dealing with his wife's death and moving to a retirement home. He's seeking companionship, which is understandable. However, the age gap might lead others to question his motives or the power dynamics in the relationship. \n\nPower dynamics are important here. The author is older, wealthier, and in a position where he might have more experience or resources. The girlfriend is much younger, which could mean she's less experienced in relationships or more vulnerable. Even if both parties are consenting adults, there's a risk that the relationship isn't entirely equal. \n\nAlso, the author hasn't told his family yet. Hiding a relationship from family could indicate some shame or fear of judgment, which might not be healthy. The fact that he's seeking opinions on Reddit suggests he's conflicted. \n\nOn the other hand, as long as the relationship is consensual and both people are happy, some might argue it's none of others' business. The key points are consent, legality, and mutual respect. If both are comfortable and the relationship is healthy, then maybe it's not the author's fault. But given the significant age difference and potential for exploitation or misunderstanding, others might say he is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the relationship is healthy and consensual. If yes, then not wrong. If there's an imbalance or potential for harm, then wrong. But with the info given, there's no indication of coercion. The author is seeking companionship, which is valid. However, societal judgment is strong here. So maybe the answer is not wrong, but there are valid concerns. The Reddit community would probably have mixed opinions, but the key is that as long as it's consensual, he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
