My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating someone much younger. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 73, and his girlfriend is 20. That's a 53-year age gap. That's pretty significant. He mentions that his wife recently died, and he's dealing with loneliness. He's trying to find companionship, which is understandable after losing a spouse. But the key issue here is the age difference and the perception of it. \n\nHe's also comparing his girlfriend's age to his granddaughter's, which makes him feel uneasy. The family hasn't been told yet, which might indicate he's aware there could be some backlash. The main question is whether this age gap makes him an asshole. \n\nLegally, there's no issue here because the girl is 20 and presumably of legal age. But socially, such a big age gap can be controversial. People might think he's exploiting a young person, especially since he mentions the website connects younger girls with older, wealthier guys. That could imply a transactional aspect, which adds another layer of concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a vulnerable time after his wife's death and might genuinely be seeking comfort and company. If the relationship is consensual and both parties are happy, some might argue it's none of others' business. But the dynamics here\u2014like power imbalance due to age and wealth\u2014could mean the younger person is in a position where they might not feel empowered to say no or might be influenced by the older person's resources.\n\nAlso, considering the granddaughter's age being similar to his girlfriend, family reactions could be harsh. But without knowing the specifics of the relationship's nature, it's hard to judge. If there's any form of manipulation or coercion, that's a red flag. However, if it's a mutual, loving relationship, some might say it's personal and not the author's fault.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the legal aspect is okay, but the ethical and social issues are more complex. The author might be in the wrong if there's an exploitation angle, but if it's a genuine connection, maybe not. But given the context of the website and the age difference, the inclination is to think there's a problem. Therefore, the answer leans towards A.\n"
