My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a 73-year-old man dating a 20-year-old woman. The man's wife recently passed away, and he's struggling with loneliness. He's using a website that connects older, wealthier men with younger women. He's been dating his girlfriend for three months and feels uneasy because she's about the same age as his granddaughter. He hasn't told his family yet.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if there's any legal issue here. In most places, the age of consent is 18, so a 20-year-old is legally an adult. So there's no legal wrong here. Legally, it's allowed. \n\nThen, socially, there's a big age gap. The man is 73, the woman is 20. The age difference is 53 years. That's a significant gap. But the woman isn't underage, so the legality isn't the issue. Now, the question is about morality. The man's own family hasn't been informed yet. He's feeling conflicted because his granddaughter's age is similar to his girlfriend's. That might be causing him guilt or anxiety.\n\nPossible arguments against him: The age difference is so large that there might be an imbalance in the relationship. The woman is much younger, and the man is older with more life experience. There could be power dynamics if he's using a platform that's designed for such pairings. Also, the man is entering a retirement home, which might affect the relationship's future. But the woman is an adult, so she's capable of making her own decisions. \n\nPossible arguments in his favor: He's grieving, and he's seeking companionship. The woman isn't underage, so it's not illegal. He's not taking advantage of someone in a vulnerable position. Both are consenting adults. The man is trying to cope with loneliness, which is understandable after losing his wife.\n\nThe key points here are consent, legality, mutual agreement, and the context of the man's circumstances. The subreddit often looks at the intent and the well-being of both parties. If the relationship is consensual and both are happy, some might argue it's okay. Others might criticize the age gap regardless. However, since the woman is an adult and the relationship is consensual, the man isn't necessarily in the wrong. The subreddit often emphasizes that as long as there's no harm or coercion, personal choices in relationships are their own. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the platform being designed for such pairings, which might have its own ethical considerations. However, the man's primary issue is his own feelings of guilt and the potential family reaction. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the relationship is consensual and legal, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if there's an element of using a platform that targets such age gaps for financial reasons, that could be a different angle. But the subreddit usually focuses on the personal ethics rather than the platform's intent. \n\nIn conclusion, unless there's exploitation or non-consensual elements, which aren't indicated here, the man isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
