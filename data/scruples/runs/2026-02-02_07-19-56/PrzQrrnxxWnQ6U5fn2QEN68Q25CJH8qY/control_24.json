My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating someone younger. The author is 73, his girlfriend is 20, which is a 53-year age gap. The question is whether this is acceptable or if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is around 16-18. Since she's 20, that's definitely past the age of consent. So legally, it's fine.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. Age gaps in relationships are common, but the size can be a point of contention. The key here is the power dynamic. The author is older, wealthier, and possibly in a position where he could take advantage. There's a concern that the younger person might be interested in his resources rather than a genuine connection. But the author mentions they've been dating for 3 months and things are going well. The girl's motivations aren't clear here, but if it's mutual and consensual, maybe that's okay.\n\nAlso, the author is going through a tough time after his wife's death and needs companionship. The social stigma around older men dating much younger women is real, but that doesn't make it right or wrong. The author's feelings about the age gap being similar to his granddaughter's age might be a personal discomfort. Granddaughters are often close to the age of his girlfriend, so that comparison could make him feel uneasy, but it's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for exploitation. If the older person is in a retirement home and the younger person is significantly younger, there's a risk that the relationship could be one-sided. But the author says they're happy. The main issue is whether both parties are entering the relationship willingly and without coercion. If that's the case, then it's more about personal values than right or wrong.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, such a large age gap might be frowned upon more. But the question is from a Reddit post, which is more of a Western context where age gaps are often critiqued, especially when the older person is significantly older and the younger is in a more vulnerable position.\n\nThe author's own feelings of being an asshole suggest he's conflicted. The question is whether he's actually in the wrong. The answer would depend on mutual consent, the lack of coercion, and the absence of harm. Since all that isn't mentioned here, and the relationship is consensual, the answer might lean towards B. But there's also the aspect of power imbalance and potential for manipulation that could argue for A. However, without evidence that the younger person is being taken advantage of, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
