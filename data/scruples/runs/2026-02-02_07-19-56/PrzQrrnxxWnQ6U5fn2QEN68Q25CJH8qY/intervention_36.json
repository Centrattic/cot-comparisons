My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a 73-year-old man who's dating a 20-year-old girl. He's been widowed, and he's trying to find companionship, especially since he might need to go into a retirement home. He's using a website that connects older, wealthier guys with younger girls. The main issue is the age gap, and he's feeling uneasy because she's about the same age as his granddaughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is around 16 or 18, depending on the country. Since he's with a 20-year-old, assuming that's above the age of consent where he is, then legally it's okay. But legal doesn't always mean socially acceptable.\n\nThen there's the social and ethical angle. Age gaps in relationships can be a touchy subject. A 53-year age difference is huge. The power dynamics here are significant. The website he's using is designed to connect older, wealthier men with younger women, which might imply that the relationship could be transactional. If the younger woman is in it for his wealth, that could be a problem. But the question is about whether the older man is in the wrong. The author says things are going great, so maybe he's not exploiting her, but the potential for exploitation is there. \n\nAlso, considering his situation: he's grieving, and maybe seeking companionship. But does that justify a relationship with someone so much younger? There's also the family aspect. He hasn't told his family yet, which might be a red flag. The fact that the girl is around the age of his granddaughter adds another layer. It's possible that the family might disapprove, but that's not necessarily his fault unless he's intentionally causing harm.\n\nAnother point is the health and mobility issues. He mentioned leaving the house is difficult, so maybe the relationship is more convenient for him because she's younger and can help with things. But again, unless it's coercive, that's not automatically wrong. \n\nI need to think about whether the relationship is consensual and if there's any form of manipulation or coercion. The author says the relationship is going well, so maybe both parties are happy. However, the significant age difference and the context of his age and hers could mean that there's an imbalance in the relationship that might not be immediately apparent. \n\nIn some cultures, such a relationship might be more accepted, but in others, it's seen as inappropriate. The subreddit and website he's using might be in a place where such relationships are more common, but that doesn't make it right necessarily. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional maturity. A 20-year-old is still young and might not have the same life experiences as a 73-year-old. There's a risk that she's not fully aware of the long-term implications of the relationship, or that her needs might not align with his. \n\nBut if both are entering the relationship voluntarily and both are happy, then maybe it's not his fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's taking advantage of a power dynamic, even if unintentionally, he could be. But if it's mutually beneficial and consensual, maybe he's not. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, the age gap is extreme, and there's a potential for exploitation. On the other hand, he's a grieving man seeking companionship, and the relationship is consensual. The answer depends on the context of consent and mutual respect. Since the scenario doesn't indicate any coercion or harm, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But the significant age difference and the nature of the website he's using might suggest that there's an inherent issue. \n\nHmm. Maybe the key is whether the relationship is healthy and consensual. If both parties are aware and agree, then it's not his fault. But the subreddit's question is about whether he's an asshole. If he's being honest and treating her well, maybe not. But the fact that he's using a website that targets this dynamic might imply that he's part of a system that could be exploitative. \n\nOverall, I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of the extreme age difference and the context of the website, even if the relationship is consensual. The power imbalance is too significant, and the age gap is so large that it's ethically questionable regardless of consent.\n"
