My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a 73-year-old man who's been dating a 20-year-old for three months. He's dealing with the loss of his wife and the difficulty of living alone. He used a website that connects older, wealthier men with younger women. The question is whether he's in the wrong for this relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. A 53-year gap is significant. There's a lot of debate about age gaps in relationships. Some argue that as long as both parties consent and are comfortable, it's okay. Others might see it as exploitative, especially if there's a power imbalance, like financial support from the older man. In this case, the man is using the site because he's older and possibly wealthier, and the woman is significantly younger. \n\nThe man mentions that he's approaching retirement home living and has trouble leaving the house. This part is important. If the younger woman is helping him with daily activities or providing care, that could complicate things. However, he says they've been dating for three months and things are going well. He hasn't mentioned any coercion or manipulation on his part, just that he found her through the site.\n\nLegally, if both are adults, it's consensual. But socially and ethically, people might have different views. The man is in a vulnerable life phase, which could make others question his judgment. Also, the comparison to his granddaughter's age is a red flag for some, as it might lead to family disapproval or personal discomfort.\n\nAnother angle is the woman's perspective. If she's an adult and fully consents, and both are happy, maybe it's not wrong. But if the relationship is based on the man's financial resources or the woman's youth, that could be problematic. The use of a site specifically for older, wealthier men and younger women might imply that the dynamic is transactional, which some people would see as unethical.\n\nI also need to consider the cultural context. In some cultures, age gaps are more accepted, while in others, they're frowned upon. The man's intention to date people his age first but couldn't due to mobility issues adds context. His loneliness and grief after his wife's death might be influencing his decisions, which could be seen as a mitigating factor. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the age gap.\n\nThe key factors here are consent, mutual agreement, and whether there's any exploitation. If both are adults, in love, and not being harmed, some might say it's okay. But others might argue that the power dynamics (age, wealth, life stage) create an imbalance that's inherently exploitative. The man's hesitation and feeling uneasy suggest he's aware of societal judgment, which adds to the complexity.\n\nSo, weighing all these points, the answer could go either way. But since the question is asking if he's in the wrong, I have to decide if the consensual aspect overrides the potential issues. If the relationship is healthy and both are happy, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the woman is taking advantage of his financial status and situation, then he might be. Since the woman's motivations aren't clear, it's hard to say. However, using a site that caters to such age gaps might indicate that the relationship isn't equal. So, leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the significant age difference and potential exploitation, even if it's consensual.\n"
