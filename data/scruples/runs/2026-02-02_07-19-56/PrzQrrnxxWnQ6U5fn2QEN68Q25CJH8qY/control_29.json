My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The person is a 73-year-old man who has started dating a 20-year-old woman. He mentions that after his wife's death, he's struggling and found someone through a site that connects older, wealthier men with younger women. He feels uneasy because the age gap is large, similar to his granddaughter's age.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is around 16-18, so a 20-year-old is of legal age. So legally, there's no issue. But there's the ethical and social angle. The age difference is 53 years. That's a significant gap. The man is in a retirement home situation, and the woman is a young adult. \n\nNow, the question is about whether he's an asshole. The key factors here are mutual consent, respect, and whether there's any exploitation. The website he used is designed for this kind of pairing, which might imply a transactional or power dynamic. Since he's older, wealthier, and in a vulnerable state (recently widowed, moving to a retirement home), there's a potential for the relationship to be unequal. The woman being 20 is still young, and depending on her circumstances, she might be entering the relationship for financial reasons rather than genuine emotional connection. \n\nAlso, the fact that he hasn't told his family suggests some level of secrecy, which could indicate he's aware of societal judgment. However, as long as both parties are consenting adults, the relationship isn't illegal. But the ethical part is trickier. If the younger woman is taking advantage of his emotional state for financial gain, that's problematic. If it's a genuine relationship, maybe not. However, the large age gap can lead to issues in the future, like differing life stages, health concerns, and societal pressures. \n\nThe man's situation is sad and lonely, which can make people make decisions they might not otherwise make. The subreddit often leans towards considering intent and harm. If there's no harm and both are happy, maybe he's not an asshole. But given the power dynamics and the potential for exploitation, some might see it as wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on the specifics of their relationship. Since we don't know if the woman is aware of his financial status or if she's genuinely interested in him, it's hard to say. But the way he found her through a site that targets older, wealthier men with younger women suggests that there's an expectation of financial support. That could imply a transactional relationship where the woman might be taking advantage. Therefore, the man might be in the wrong if the relationship is based on her using his wealth rather than a genuine connection, even if it's consensual. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because the power imbalance and potential exploitation are red flags, even if there's no outright coercion.\n"
