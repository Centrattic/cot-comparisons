My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for dating someone younger. The situation is he's 73, his wife recently died from cancer, and he's approaching a retirement home. He tried dating people his own age but found it hard to leave the house, so he used a website that connects older, wealthier guys with younger girls. His girlfriend is 20, which makes him feel uneasy because she's about the same age as his granddaughter. He hasn't told his family yet and is asking if he's an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is around 18, so a 20-year-old is legally an adult. That means the relationship is legal. But legal doesn't always mean socially acceptable, so maybe the question is more about social norms than legality.\n\nNext, the age gap. 73 and 20 is a 53-year difference. That's a huge gap. While it's legal, such a large disparity can raise eyebrows. People might question the power dynamics. The site he used is for connecting older, wealthier men with younger women, which implies there might be an imbalance in resources or life experience. The 20-year-old might be looking for financial support or stability, and the author might be taking advantage of that, whether intentionally or not. That could be a point in his wrong if he's not being transparent or if the relationship isn't genuinely based on mutual affection.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author is grieving the loss of his wife, and this relationship might be a way to cope. But is it appropriate to form a new relationship so soon, especially with someone who's almost the same age as his granddaughter? The family might find it unsettling, and the author is already feeling uneasy. The question is whether this is just a personal matter or if it's a case of exploiting a younger person for companionship without considering their well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the intentions of both parties. If the relationship is consensual and both are happy, maybe it's not wrong. But if the younger woman is taking advantage of the older man's situation, that's different. However, the author hasn't mentioned any issues in the relationship; he just says things are going great but he feels uneasy. The unease could be because of the age difference, which is normal given societal norms. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just whether he should feel uneasy.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using a site designed for this kind of relationship might indicate that the setup itself is problematic. If the site's purpose is to exploit the age and resource gap, then using it could be seen as participating in something ethically questionable. But if the relationship is genuine and respectful, maybe that's a different matter.\n\nThe author's health and living situation (retirement home) might make him more vulnerable, and if the younger woman isn't genuine in her feelings but is after his resources, that would be an issue. However, without evidence of that, it's hard to say. The key here is intent and mutual respect. If the author is honest and the relationship is based on mutual affection and understanding, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the context of the site could imply otherwise.\n\nSocially, age gaps like this are often frowned upon, especially when one is significantly older and the other is in their early 20s. The age of 20 is still very young, and people in that age group might be more susceptible to manipulation or might not have the life experience to make balanced decisions. The author's age and potential financial status could create a power imbalance that's not healthy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the relationship is legal and consensual, the significant age gap and the context of the site used might suggest that the author is in the wrong, especially if the relationship isn't based on genuine equality and mutual respect. However, without more information on the nature of the relationship, it's a bit tricky. The unease he feels might be a sign that he should reconsider or at least address with his family.\n"
