My wife recently died due to cancer and things have gotten pretty hard without her. I am 73 years old and approaching the point where I\u2019ll need to go to a retirement home. I tried dating some people my age, but even leaving the house is quite difficult. I found out about a website that is designed to connect younger girls with older, wealthier guys. I have been dating my now girlfriend, who is 20 years old, for 3 months. Things have been going great, but I feel a bit uneasy that she is about the same age as my granddaughter. I haven\u2019t opened up to my family about this but am trying to figure out if I am an asshole for dating someone with such a large age gap. Thank you and look forward to hearing your opinion about this.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the older man is in the wrong for dating a 20-year-old when he's 73. The situation is that his wife just died, he's getting older, and he found a dating site that connects older guys with younger girls. The main issue is the age gap, especially since the girl is about the same age as his granddaughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In most places, 20 is the age of consent, so legally he's fine. Then there's the aspect of the relationship being consensual. If both parties are adults and agree to the relationship, that's a key factor. But the emotional aspect is tricky. He's recently lost his wife, so he's dealing with grief. The age difference is significant, but as long as there's no coercion or manipulation, maybe it's okay. \n\nThe user mentions feeling uneasy because the girlfriend is around the granddaughter's age. That might be a family concern if he ever tells them, but the question is about his rightness. The subreddit often looks at intentions and power dynamics. If he's not taking advantage and they're both into it, maybe he's not wrong. On the other hand, some might argue that older men dating much younger women is inherently problematic due to life stages and potential for exploitation. But since he's clear that it's consensual and they're happy, the answer might be B. I need to make sure there's no non-consensual elements, which the story doesn't mention. So probably B.\n"
