  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author runs a gym chain with family members. They have a younger biological brother and sister involved, as well as a brother-in-law. The adopted brother, now 22, was taken in as a foster child but wasn't legally adopted. The author helped raise him but found him difficult, with issues like alcoholism and legal problems. They gave him a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his own business at their gyms. The adopted brother wanted a promotion to assistant manager, which the author denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. The brother reacted angrily, damaging property.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are family dynamics, business decisions, and the treatment of the adopted brother. \n\nThe author mentions that the adopted brother was not legally adopted but introduced as family for his feelings. This might mean the author's family considered him part of the family emotionally but not legally. The brother started using the family last name, which upset the author, leading to a physical reaction. When the brother asked for a promotion, the author rejected him, citing both qualification issues and blood relation.\n\nThe question is whether excluding someone from a family business based on not being blood-related is fair, especially when they were raised as family. However, the author also notes that the brother has a history of problematic behavior, legal issues, and a lack of work ethic. The business is a family concern, and the author might prioritize trust and reliability, which are harder to ensure with someone who has a history of failures.\n\nOn the other hand, treating someone differently because they aren't blood relatives could be seen as discriminatory, especially if they were considered family. However, the author isn't legally bound to include him, and the brother's behavior (using the last name despite being asked not to, damaging property) might justify the author's decision.\n\nThe brother's reaction was extreme, but the author's refusal might be based on legitimate concerns about the business's stability. The user needs to decide if the author's reasons are valid. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's exclusion was based on fair business practices or family favoritism. Given the brother's history and the author's need to trust those in charge, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
