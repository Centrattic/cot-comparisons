Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's adopted \"brother\" wanting a position in the family business. The author runs a chain of gyms with their father, who passed away. Now, the author has a biological brother and sister in management roles, along with their brother-in-law. The adopted brother, who's 22, was taken in by the family when he was a child, but the author has had issues with his behavior over the years\u2014like being unruly, an alcoholic, and having legal problems. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his personal trainer business. Now, the adopted brother wants the assistant manager role, which the author denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The brother reacted angrily, causing damage to the building.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The adopted brother wasn't legally adopted but was raised by the family. The author feels he's not a real sibling and is more of an annoyance. The author has a history of helping him out despite his issues. The business is family-run, and the author prefers keeping it within their immediate family. The key points are: the adopted brother's qualifications, the author's right to decide business roles, and whether discrimination based on family status is justified.\n\nThe author's main arguments are that the adopted brother isn't qualified and isn't blood-related. The brother, however, might feel entitled because he was raised by the family, even if not legally. The author's sister thinks the author went too far, which suggests some family conflict.\n\nIn terms of business ethics, it's generally acceptable to hire family as long as it's legal and fair. However, favoring biological family over others might be a point of contention. The author's reasoning is that they can trust their blood relatives. But the adopted brother might argue that he's been part of the family for years and was treated as such. The fact that he uses the family name despite being asked not to could indicate a lack of respect, which might support the author's position.\n\nLegally, using family status in hiring isn't necessarily illegal unless there's discrimination based on protected classes, which isn't the case here. The author's business has the right to hire whoever they choose, even if it's biased towards family. However, there's also the aspect of fairness and potential for resentment within the family.\n\nThe author's sister's reaction is another factor. If she previously supported the author's feelings but now thinks he went too far, there might be a breakdown in communication. The brother's outburst (damaging the door) is a sign of his frustration, which could be due to feeling unappreciated or undervalued despite his efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a legitimate concern about the adopted brother's reliability given his past issues with alcohol, legal troubles, and lack of work ethic. The author has tried mentoring him without success, so denying the promotion based on qualifications makes sense. The fact that he's not qualified is a valid business reason, which might outweigh the family aspect.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision was based on both the brother's qualifications and the business's need to keep it within the immediate family. However, the way it was communicated might have been harsh, especially if the brother felt entitled. The author could have handled the rejection more sensitively but isn't necessarily in the wrong for making the decision based on business needs and the brother's lack of suitability.\n"
