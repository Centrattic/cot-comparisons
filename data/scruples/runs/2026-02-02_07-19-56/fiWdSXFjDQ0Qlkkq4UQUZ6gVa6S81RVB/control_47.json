Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves family dynamics, business decisions, and personal relationships.\n\nFirst, the author runs a gym chain with family members. They have a biological brother and sister involved in management, as well as a brother-in-law. The key issue is with an adopted \"brother,\" who was actually fostered and not legally adopted. The author introduced him as a brother to make him feel included, but now there's tension because he wants a promotion in the business.\n\nThe author gave him a part-time job and allowed his personal trainer business to advertise there. However, the foster brother has a history of issues: alcoholism, criminal charges, and a lack of work ethic. The author feels he's not qualified for the assistant manager role and isn't family, hence the refusal. This led to a confrontation where the foster brother reacted angrily, damaging property.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The author has the right to decide who gets promoted in their business. They've provided opportunities (part-time job, allowing his business to advertise) despite his past issues. The foster brother, however, is pushing for a role without the necessary qualifications and has a problematic history. The author's refusal is based on merit and family ties, which is a valid business decision. \n\nThe foster brother's entitlement and the author's refusal to recognize him as family might be sensitive, but the author isn't obligated to give him a position. The foster brother's reaction (damaging property) is his own fault, not the author's. The author did communicate the reasons clearly, so there's no hidden agenda. The sister's disapproval might come from empathy for the foster brother, but the author's stance is about business and family trust.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a tough but justified decision based on the foster brother's qualifications and the business's needs. The foster brother's issues and entitlement are his own, and the author isn't responsible for his outburst.\n"
