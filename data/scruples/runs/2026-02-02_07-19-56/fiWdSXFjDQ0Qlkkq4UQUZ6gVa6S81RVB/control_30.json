  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family business and an adopted \"brother\" who wants a position in the company.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer runs a gym chain with their late father, now involving their real siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother, who wasn't legally adopted but raised by them, is now 22 and wants a management role. The writer gave him a part-time job but refused a higher position, leading to conflict.\n\nThe adopted brother has a history of issues: alcoholism, arrests, being unqualified. The writer feels he's not a real sibling and is frustrated by his behavior. When the brother pushed for the position, the writer told him he's not blood family, which led to an outburst.\n\nNow, to determine if the writer is in the wrong. On one hand, the brother was raised by them and they might feel a sense of responsibility. But the writer is running a business and may need to prioritize competence and trust. The brother's actions (cracking the door, lying about the last name) suggest he's not respecting boundaries. The writer's refusal based on qualifications and family ties could be seen as fair, especially if the business is kept within the legal family. However, maybe the writer could have handled it more sensitively. But considering the brother's history, the writer's stance might be justified. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because business decisions sometimes prioritize capability and trust, and the brother's behavior has been problematic.\n"
