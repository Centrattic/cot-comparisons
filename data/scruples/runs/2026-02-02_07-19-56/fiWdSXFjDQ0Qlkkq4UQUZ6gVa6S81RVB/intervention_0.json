Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author runs a family business with their siblings and brother-in-law. The \"adopted brother\" was taken in by their mom when he was four, but he's been problematic: unruly, a recovering alcoholic, had run-ins with the law, and isn't successful despite the family's support. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own business, but when he asked for an assistant manager role, the author refused, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. The brother reacted angrily, and now the author's sister thinks they went too far.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to tell him he's not family. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nI should consider a few angles. Legally, the brother isn't adopted, so he's not a legal family member, but they've been raised as part of the family. However, the author might have a right to prioritize blood relatives in their business, especially if they feel trust is important. On the other hand, the brother has been part of the family for a long time, and the author's mother took him in, which might mean the family sees him as part of the family, even if not legally.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother isn't qualified and isn't blood. But the brother might feel entitled because of being introduced as family and the long-term care the family provided. The author's sister is upset, which could indicate family dynamics are complicated.\n\nEthically, it's about fairness. If the brother applied for a job, the author might have a right to choose based on qualifications and family trust. But if the brother was led to believe he was part of the family, the author's refusal without considering his capabilities might be harsh. However, the brother's track record of failures and issues might justify the author's decision.\n\nAlso, the way the author responded\u2014saying he's not family\u2014might hurt the brother's feelings, especially if the family introduced him as such. But the author's business decisions are their right. The key points are whether the author's actions were fair and if they handled the situation appropriately.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're the business owner and can make decisions based on trust and qualifications. However, the way they communicated it might be problematic. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the communication. Since the author isn't legally obligated to give him a position and the brother's behavior justifies the decision, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to consider the family aspect. If the family has always treated him as a sibling, the author's denial of family status could be seen as a betrayal. However, the author's sister's reaction might suggest some family conflict, but the author's right to run the business as they see fit is important. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
