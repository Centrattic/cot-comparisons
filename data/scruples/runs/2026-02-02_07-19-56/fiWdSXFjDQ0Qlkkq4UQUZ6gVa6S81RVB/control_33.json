Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business.\n\nFirst, the background: The author runs a family business with their blood siblings. The \"brother\" in question was fostered by their family and later treated as a sibling, though not legally adopted. They gave him a part-time job and some privileges but now he's asking for a promotion to assistant manager, which requires responsibility. The author denied him, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The foster brother got angry, causing damage, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are family dynamics, business decisions, and personal relationships. The author is trying to keep the business in the real family, which is common in family-run businesses. The foster brother, however, feels entitled because of the familial treatment he received. The author is clear that they don't see him as a sibling anymore, given his behavior and failures. \n\nThe author's actions seem to be about protecting the business and setting boundaries after years of frustration. The foster brother's reaction is extreme, but the author had already warned him about the lack of qualification and blood relation. The sister's support for the author in the past but now siding with the foster brother might indicate some tension, but the author's main action was to deny the promotion based on merit and family ties.\n\nFrom a business perspective, hiring within the real family can be seen as necessary for trust and reliability. The foster brother's history with legal issues and lack of success in his own ventures might make the author hesitant. The author also mentions the foster brother using the father's last name, which is a sensitive issue.\n\nHowever, the way the author communicated the rejection could be seen as harsh. Telling someone they're not part of the family might be hurtful, even if it's the truth in the author's view. But considering the long history and the foster brother's own behavior (like the slam causing damage), the author's stance might be justified.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a business decision based on qualifications and family ties. The foster brother might have felt entitled, but the author has the right to prioritize real family members in a family business. The sister's reaction could be due to her own feelings, but the author's actions align with protecting the business and setting boundaries after years of issues.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
