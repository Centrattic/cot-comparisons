Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their father, now deceased. They have a biological brother and sister in management roles, and their brother-in-law is also involved. The adopted brother was taken in by the author's parents when he was a child, but the author helped raise him and found it difficult. The adopted brother is now 22, a recovering alcoholic, has been in trouble for theft and DUI, and the author has bailed him out multiple times. The adopted brother is working part-time as a receptionist and promoting his own failing business at the gyms. He recently asked for an assistant manager role, got rejected, and reacted angrily, causing damage. The author told him he's not family, and their sister is upset with them.\n\nSo, the main points are about family business roles and the relationship between the author and the adopted brother. The author emphasized keeping the business in the family, which is common. The adopted brother was introduced as family to make him feel included, even though he's not legally adopted. The author's rejection based on qualifications and not being blood-related led to conflict. The sister supports the adopted brother despite previous disagreements.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider both sides. The author might feel they have a right to prioritize family members, especially since the adopted brother has a history of issues and lack of qualifications. On the other hand, the adopted brother might feel entitled due to being raised in the family, even if not legally. The sister's reaction could imply that the author's statement was harsh, even if the decision to not hire the adopted brother was justified. The author's frustration is understandable given past experiences, but the way they handled the rejection might have been insensitive. However, the core issue is about employment decisions in a family business. Since the adopted brother isn't blood-related and the author has concerns about his behavior and competence, the author might not be in the wrong for making that decision, even if the sister is upset. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they have the right to make business decisions based on qualifications and family ties, and the adopted brother's actions (like causing damage) support the author's stance.\n"
