Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author runs a gym chain and has family members involved in the business. There's an adopted \"brother\" (not legally adopted) named by the mother, who has been taken care of since he was a kid. The author tried to be a mentor but found the kid difficult, with issues like alcoholism and being in and out of jail. Now the adopted brother wants a higher position in the business, and the author refused, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they gave the adopted brother a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his personal trainer business. But when the adopted brother asked for a more responsible position (assistant manager), the author turned him down. The reasons given are lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The adopted brother then reacted angrily, slamming a door and causing a crack. The sister is upset with the author.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to make business decisions based on merit. The adopted brother has a history of issues, including arrests and a failed business. The author's family has legitimate concerns about his reliability and qualifications. The author also mentions that he's not a blood relative, which is a factor in the family's preference to keep things in the family.\n\nOn the other hand, the adopted brother was raised by the family, albeit unofficially. The mother took him in, and the family introduced him as their own, which might have created expectations. The author's refusal might have hurt the adopted brother's feelings, especially since he's been part of their lives for so long. The way the author communicated the refusal could come off as dismissive, using \"not my blood\" as a reason, which might be seen as harsh.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were unfair. In business, decisions should be based on skills and qualifications. The author did give the adopted brother a part-time role but not a higher position. However, the adopted brother's behavior and lack of qualifications might justify the refusal. The sister's reaction suggests there's some family dynamics at play. The author might have handled the situation better, perhaps by explaining the reasons more sensitively, but the decision itself might be justifiable.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is in the wrong for making a business decision based on qualifications and family ties. Since the author's family has a policy of keeping things in the family, and the adopted brother isn't a blood relative, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the way the refusal was communicated might have been insensitive. The author's frustration is understandable given the adopted brother's history. But the sister's reaction indicates that maybe the author could have approached it differently. However, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author might not be at fault for making a business choice based on merit and family preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), because the business has a right to choose based on qualifications and family ties, even if the communication could have been better.\n"
