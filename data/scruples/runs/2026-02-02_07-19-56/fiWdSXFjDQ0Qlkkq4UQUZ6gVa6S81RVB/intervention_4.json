Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about someone running a family business and having an adopted \"brother\" who wants to join the company. The author says no, and the adopted brother gets upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author has a family business with his siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother isn't blood-related but was raised by the family. He's 22 now, has a criminal record (theft, DUI), is a recovering alcoholic, and has failed academically. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own business at the gyms. The adopted brother asked for an assistant manager role, was rejected, and then got angry, leading to a broken door.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the adopted brother isn't qualified and not blood-related. The adopted brother feels like he's part of the family and is upset about being excluded. The sister thinks the author was too harsh, even though she shares his past feelings.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Family businesses often prioritize blood relatives because they can trust them more, which makes sense. But the adopted brother was part of the family from a young age, even if not legally. The mother treated him as family, so the adopted brother might feel entitled to the same opportunities.\n\nBut the author has a right to choose who to hire in their business. The adopted brother's track record (criminal issues, alcoholism, lack of qualification) makes him a risky candidate. The author isn't obligated to give him a role just because he's considered a family friend. However, the way the author rejected him, emphasizing that he's not blood, might come off as insensitive. The adopted brother was raised by them, so the author's cold rejection could hurt feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that the adopted brother used the father's last name and the author is upset about that adds to the tension. The author might feel the brother is appropriating family identity without the responsibilities.\n\nThe sister's reaction suggests there's internal conflict. The author might have handled the communication better, maybe explaining the decision more compassionately. But the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving the position. Since the business is family-run and the brother doesn't meet the qualifications, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not hiring him. However, the manner of refusal could be seen as harsh. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not about the manner. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not offering the job. The decision is based on qualifications and family business dynamics. The adopted brother's behavior and lack of suitability are valid reasons for rejection. The sister thinking the author went too far might relate to how it was said, but not the decision itself. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
