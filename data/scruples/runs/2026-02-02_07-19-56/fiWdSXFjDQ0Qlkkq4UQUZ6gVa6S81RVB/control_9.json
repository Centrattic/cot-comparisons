  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an adopted \"brother\" wanting a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has a family business and has given the adopted brother a part-time job and some opportunities. The adopted brother, however, has a history of issues\u2014alcoholism, legal problems, and isn't qualified for a higher position. The author says they tried to be a mentor but couldn't, and now they're not seeing him as a sibling but an annoyance. The author rejected him for the assistant manager role, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The brother reacted angrily, damaging property and told the sister, who now thinks the author went too far.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author tried to help, the brother has a troubled past and isn't qualified, the business is family-focused. The author's rejection is based on merit and family preference. The brother's reaction was inappropriate. The sister's opinion is mixed, but the author's actions seem reasonable given the brother's history. The author also asked him not to use the family name, which he ignored. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's decision is based on the brother's unfitness for the role and family priorities. The brother's behavior (slamming doors, using the last name) shows he's not respecting boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
