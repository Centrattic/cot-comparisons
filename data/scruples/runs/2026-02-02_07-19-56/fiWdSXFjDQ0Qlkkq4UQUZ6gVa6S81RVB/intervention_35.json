Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business.\n\nFirst, the context: The author runs a gym chain with family members. They have a biological brother and sister in management roles, and a brother-in-law. The \"adopted\" brother was taken in as a foster child but isn't legally adopted. He's now 22, working part-time, has a personal trainer business, and has a history of legal issues and substance abuse. The author gave him a receptionist job but not a management role. When the foster brother asked for an assistant manager position, the author refused, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related. The foster brother reacted angrily, leading to a conflict with the sister.\n\nThe user suspects the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments. The author's stance is that they want to keep the business family-run. Since the foster brother isn't blood-related, the author feels justified in not offering him a management role. However, the foster brother was raised by them, introduced as family, and now feels entitled. The author's refusal could be seen as inconsistent if they've treated him as family publicly and provided him with some roles. Also, the foster brother's reaction might be a result of feeling rejected despite being part of the family for so long.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is under no obligation to hire him, especially given his history. The author has a right to run the business as they see fit, prioritizing qualifications and reliability. The foster brother's behavior, including legal issues and lack of professionalism, might make the author's decision reasonable.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The foster brother isn't legally family but was raised as such. 2) The author's refusal is based on both qualification and blood relation. 3) The foster brother's reaction is a result of feeling excluded after being treated as family.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the foster brother was truly considered family, then excluding him based on blood alone might be unfair. However, the author might not have considered him family in terms of business decisions. The foster brother's entitlement could be an issue, but the author's refusal to honor the family image might be the problem. There's inconsistency in treating him as family in public but not in business roles. The author's decision to prioritize blood relatives could be seen as discriminatory if the foster brother was raised as such. However, the author isn't legally bound to treat him as family, especially since he's not adopted. The foster brother's own behavior (legal issues, lack of success) might justify the author's decision. The main conflict is the foster brother's expectation versus the author's business judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal is based on valid business reasons, but the way they handled it might have been harsh. However, the decision itself isn't necessarily wrong. The foster brother's actions and the author's business needs are key factors. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there's nuance. The foster brother's sense of entitlement is problematic, but the author's approach might have been abrupt. Still, the author isn't obligated to hire him, so the answer is likely B.\n"
