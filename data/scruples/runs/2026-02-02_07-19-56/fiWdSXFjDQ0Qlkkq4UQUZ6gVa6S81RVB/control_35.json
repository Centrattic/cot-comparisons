  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a family business and an adopted \"brother\" wanting a position. The writer runs the gyms with their father, who passed away. Their real siblings and brother-in-law are in management roles. The adopted brother, who's 22, was taken in by the family when he was a kid. The writer helped raise him but now sees him as an annoyance. The adopted brother wants a job in the business, like assistant manager, but the writer says no because he's not qualified and not blood-related. The brother gets angry, slams a door, and the sister thinks the writer went too far. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and business ethics. The family has a policy of keeping things in the family, which the writer mentions. Their real siblings are in management roles. The adopted brother isn't legally adopted but is introduced as family. However, the writer doesn't see him as a sibling. The brother has a history of issues: alcohol, arrests, and not getting things done. The writer gives him a part-time job and allows him to advertise his own failing business. But when the brother demands a promotion to assistant manager, the writer says no, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here might be about fairness and business decisions. Even though the brother is considered family, the writer is running a business. If the assistant manager role requires qualifications that the brother doesn't have, then the writer might be justified in not giving him the job. The writer's real siblings are in management roles, so maybe there's a precedent of choosing qualified family members over others. However, the brother was raised by the family and might feel entitled. But the writer also mentions that the brother is an \"annoyance\" and has a problematic history. The writer's refusal is based on both qualification and family ties, which could be seen as discriminatory if the brother isn't qualified. But since the business is family-run, the writer might prioritize blood relatives, even if the adopted brother is part of the family in a non-legal sense.\n\nAnother angle is how the brother's demands were handled. The writer might have made the brother feel excluded, but the brother's reaction (slamming the door) is aggressive and unprofessional. The sister's opinion that the writer went too far could suggest there's some family pressure to be more inclusive. However, the writer's stance is that they need to be selective for the business's success. The brother's use of the father's last name without permission adds to the tension, showing he might not respect the family's boundaries.\n\nIn business, qualifications are usually the main factor, but family businesses often have complex dynamics. If the brother isn't qualified, the writer isn't wrong to prioritize skills over family ties, even if the brother is raised as family. The writer's position as the business owner gives them the right to decide roles based on merit, especially if the business's success is at stake. The brother's behavior (arrests, alcohol issues) further supports the writer's decision. The sister's disagreement might be because she values family relationships more, but the writer's responsibility is to the business. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong for making a business decision based on qualifications and family ties, even if it causes family conflict.\n"
