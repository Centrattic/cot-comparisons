Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the author runs a family business and is dealing with an adopted \"brother\" who wants a position. The author says no because the person isn't qualified and isn't blood.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The adopted brother was taken in as a child, but the author has had a hard time with him\u2014alcoholism, legal issues, and not being successful. The author gave him a part-time job but when he asked for a management role, the author refused. Now, the sister thinks the author went too far.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author has a right to choose who they trust in their business. They're a family business, so prioritizing blood relatives might be seen as normal. Also, the adopted brother has a history that could affect the business. The author tried to mentor him but it didn't work. The fact that the adopted brother used the family last name without permission is another point against him.\n\nOn the other hand, even though the adopted brother isn't legally part of the family, they raised him. The author might have a responsibility to treat him with some level of respect. The adopted brother could feel betrayed, especially if he was introduced as family. The author's harsh response (saying \"you're not my blood\") might come off as cruel, even if justified. The sister's reaction suggests there might be family tension here.\n\nBut the author did try to give him opportunities. The part-time job and allowing him to advertise his business shows some support. The problem is when the adopted brother wanted a promotion. The author is protecting the business from someone with a problematic history. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're making a business decision based on competence and trust. However, the way it was communicated could be an issue. The adopted brother's reaction (slamming the door) might be his fault too, but the author's blunt refusal could have contributed.\n\nIn the end, the author's main points are about qualifications and blood relation. While the response was direct, it's a business decision. The sister's support isn't mentioned, but the author's reasoning seems valid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be sure. The key factors are the history of the adopted brother's issues and the author's responsibility to the business.\n"
