Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong when they told their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family and denied him a position in the business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a family business with their siblings and brother-in-law. They took in a foster child who's now 22, but he's had issues\u2014alcoholism, run-ins with the law, and isn't successful. The author gave him a part-time job but he wants more. The author refused a promotion to assistant manager, citing lack of qualification and not being blood family. The foster brother reacted angrily, causing damage.\n\nSo, the key points are: family business, long-term foster sibling with a troubled history, denial of promotion based on family ties and qualifications, and a conflict arising from that.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were clear about the reasons for not promoting him. But maybe the way they communicated it was harsh\u2014telling him he's not family. But they also mention they see him as an annoyance and don't consider him a sibling. However, they introduced him as family to others to make him feel included. That's a bit contradictory.\n\nThe foster brother was in a vulnerable position, especially since the family took him in as a child. The author might have a responsibility to support him, even if he's not blood-related. But at 22, he's an adult, so maybe the lines are different. The author's business is their own to run, and they have legitimate concerns about his reliability and qualifications. \n\nOn the other hand, the foster brother might feel betrayed, given the family's role in raising him. The author's decision could be seen as fair if based on merit and capability, but the personal attack on family ties might be where they went wrong. Denying a role because he's not blood could be discriminatory if other non-family members could be considered. However, since it's a family business, prioritizing family is common, but maybe not fair to others.\n\nThe foster brother's behavior also matters\u2014his actions (theft, DUIs) and not learning from the author's example. The author might be justified in not wanting to give him a position of responsibility. But the way it was communicated, especially mentioning blood, could have been hurtful. The foster brother's outburst suggests the communication wasn't handled well.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for the decision but could be in how they handled it. But the question is whether they're in the wrong at all. If the business is family-run and he's not family, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the foster brother's history with the family complicates things. The author might be in the right for business decisions but in the wrong for the personal attack on family ties.\n"
