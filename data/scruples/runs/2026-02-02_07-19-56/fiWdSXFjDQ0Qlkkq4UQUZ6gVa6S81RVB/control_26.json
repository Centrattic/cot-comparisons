  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a position in the business. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author runs a family business with their siblings. The adopted brother was taken in when he was a child because his biological mother couldn't care for him. The author helped raise him but now feels he's a burden. The adopted brother is an alcoholic, has been in trouble with the law, and the author finds him unqualified for a managerial role. The author rejected his request for a promotion and told him he's not family. The brother reacted violently, causing property damage, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the adopted brother's treatment, the author's responsibility towards him, and discrimination based on family ties in the business. The author isn't legally obligated to take care of the adopted brother since he wasn't legally adopted, but they had a long-standing relationship where they were introduced as family. The author's decision might be seen as harsh, but considering the brother's behavior and lack of qualifications, it might be a business decision. However, the way the author communicated it, possibly emphasizing blood relation, could be problematic. Also, the brother's negative reaction might indicate deeper issues, but the author's right to make business decisions based on qualifications is a factor. The sister's reaction adds another layer, maybe suggesting the author was too harsh. But the author's frustration with years of issues might justify their stance. The answer depends on balancing family obligations and business ethics.\n"
