  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author running a family business and dealing with an adopted \"brother\" who wants a more significant role. The adoptive brother was taken in by the author's family when he was a kid, but he's had a lot of issues\u2014like being unruly, an alcoholic, and having run-ins with the law. The author gave him a part-time job and let him promote his personal training business at the gyms. Now the adoptive brother is demanding a position as assistant manager, which the author refused, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The author's mom took in the boy when he was young, but he wasn't legally adopted. They introduced him as family, which might have given him certain expectations. The author, however, feels he's not a real sibling and resents the way the boy uses their father's last name. The author has tried being a mentor but has given up, seeing the boy as a burden.\n\nThe key points here are the author's refusal based on qualifications and blood relation. The adoptive brother's reaction was aggressive, breaking a door and causing a crack. The sister now thinks the author went too far, even though she's shared similar feelings before. The author's stance is that he doesn't want to hire someone unqualified and that family business roles should go to blood relatives.\n\nIs it wrong to prioritize blood family in a family business? Well, family businesses often have such traditions, and it's their right to decide who to hire. The author might have a valid point in not promoting someone who isn't qualified and has a problematic history. However, the adoptive brother was taken care of by the family, which might create expectations of family inclusion. The author's refusal might be seen as unfair if the adoptive brother considers himself part of the family, even if it's not legally formalized.\n\nBut the author's reasons are based on the person's unfitness for the role and the fact that they're not blood-related. The adoptive brother's behavior\u2014using the last name despite being told not to, his history of criminal issues, and not adapting\u2014supports the author's decision. The sister's mixed reactions might indicate some internal family conflict, but the author's decision seems pragmatic given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
