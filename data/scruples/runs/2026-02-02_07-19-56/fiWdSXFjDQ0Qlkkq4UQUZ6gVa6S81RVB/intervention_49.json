Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their father, who passed away. They have real siblings and a brother-in-law involved. The \"adopted brother\" was taken in by their mother, raised in the family, but is now 22 and wants a role in the business. He's been given a part-time job but is asking for more responsibility. The author says he's unqualified and not family, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the relationship dynamics and the business decisions. The author mentions that the person isn't legally adopted but is called a brother. The author feels he's not a sibling and sees him as an annoyance. They also mention he has a history of criminal behavior and substance abuse.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the author is making a judgment based on qualifications and trust. Family businesses often have to balance personal relationships with professional decisions. The author's stance that he's not family might be harsh, but if the person isn't qualified, the business decision could be justified. However, the way it was communicated might be an issue. The author didn't consider the emotional impact or perhaps didn't provide enough support, leading to the outburst.\n\nOn the other hand, the adopted brother was raised by the family and might feel entitled. The author's refusal could be seen as hurtful, especially if the family introduced him as a brother. The fact that he uses the father's last name and the author told him to stop adds to the tension. The author's sister thinks they went too far, indicating possible family conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they have a right to decide business roles. However, the way they dismissed the relationship and the person's feelings could be where they're at fault. The key is whether the author's actions were fair and considerate. They might not be legally wrong, but emotionally, they could be seen as uncaring. The answer might depend on cultural or family expectations. Since the question is about being in the \"wrong,\" it's a moral judgment. The author's harshness might make them the antagonist here, but the business decision is their right. So, maybe the answer is a mix, but since the options are A or B, I need to pick. If the author's actions were justified in the business context but hurtful, perhaps they're not in the wrong (B). But if the way they handled it was unkind, maybe A. Considering the sister's reaction and the emotional impact, maybe A is the answer. But I'm a bit torn. Hmm.\n"
