Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a position in the business. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author runs a family business with their blood siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother, who's 22, was taken in as a child by their mom, who passed away. The author helped raise him but he's had a lot of issues: alcoholism, getting in trouble with the law, and not being able to handle responsibilities. The author gave him a part-time receptionist job and allowed him to advertise his personal trainer business, which is failing.\n\nNow, the adopted brother wants a more responsible role as assistant manager. The author refused, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The brother got angry, broke a door, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are family dynamics, business decisions, and the treatment of someone raised in the household but not legally part of the family. The author seems to feel that the adopted brother isn't a real sibling and has caused a lot of problems, making them unfit for a higher position. The brother, on the other hand, might feel entitled to family positions despite his issues.\n\nFrom a business ethics standpoint, hiring family can be tricky. The author is prioritizing competence and trust, which are crucial in management. The brother's history of poor decisions and lack of qualifications could justify the rejection. However, the way the author handled it\u2014stating \"you're not my blood\"\u2014might come off as harsh and dismissive, potentially hurting the brother's feelings and straining family relations.\n\nThe sister's reaction suggests that while she shares some of the author's frustrations, the method used was too severe. The brother's emotional response, including breaking the door, indicates significant upset, but the author's refusal might be reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't obligated to give him a position, especially since he's not a legal family member. The author has every right to choose their management team based on merit. However, the manner in which the refusal was communicated could have been more compassionate. Telling someone they're not family might be too direct and could be seen as cruel, even if the author's stance is justified.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing the position due to the brother's lack of qualifications and negative history. But the way they expressed their decision might be where the issue lies. The answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the business decision is valid, but the communication could be improved.\n"
