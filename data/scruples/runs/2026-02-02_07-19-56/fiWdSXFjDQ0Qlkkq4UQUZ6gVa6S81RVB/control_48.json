Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author runs a family business with their siblings and brother-in-law. They have an unofficial \"adopted\" brother who was taken in as a child. The author has given him a part-time job and some support, but the brother is struggling with alcoholism, has been in legal trouble, and is now asking for a higher position. The author refused, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related. The brother reacted angrily, and the author's sister is upset with them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's business is family-run, the brother is not a biological family member, and there's a history of the brother causing problems. The author's decision is based on both capability and familial ties. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nFrom a business perspective, it's common to prioritize family members, especially if they're qualified. The author is running a business and has to make decisions that ensure its success. The adopted brother hasn't shown the necessary skills or stability for a managerial role. The author's refusal might be justified if they're trying to protect the business from someone who isn't up to the task.\n\nHowever, there's also the emotional aspect. The brother was raised by the family, even if not legally adopted. The author's sister is upset, which adds complexity. But the author's main responsibility is to the business and their biological family. The brother's behavior, including legal issues and using the father's last name, might justify the author's frustration and decision to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, could the author have handled it differently? Maybe by explaining more thoroughly or offering training. But given the brother's track record of not improving and the author's need to maintain business integrity, the decision might be seen as necessary. The brother's reaction (slamming the door, causing damage) suggests he's not handling rejection well, which might reflect on his character more than the author's decision.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions seem justified. They're protecting their business and family interests, especially given the brother's history. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no overlooked ethical issue. The problem is the brother's inclusion in the business, but the author isn't obligated to give him positions beyond what they've already provided. The final answer is B.\n"
