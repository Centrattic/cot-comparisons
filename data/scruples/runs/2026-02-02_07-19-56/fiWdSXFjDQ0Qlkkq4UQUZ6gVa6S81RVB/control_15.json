  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a family business and an adopted brother wanting a role in it. The writer runs a gym chain with their siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother, who they took in as a foster child, is now 22 and wants a management position. The writer gives him a part-time job but he's causing issues, including using the family's last name and getting into trouble with the law.\n\nThe writer is against giving him a higher position because he's not qualified and not blood-related. The adopted brother reacted badly, breaking a door. The sister thinks the writer was too harsh. The question is whether the writer is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the writer's perspective. They built the business with their father and want to keep it within the actual family. The adopted brother's behavior and lack of qualifications are a problem. The writer tried to be a mentor but couldn't. Using the last name is a pain point. They have valid reasons for not wanting to promote him, especially given his past actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the adopted brother has been part of the family since childhood, even if not legally. The mother treated him like family, so there's an emotional aspect. The writer might be seen as unfair for not giving equal opportunities, but the brother's actions and lack of suitability might justify the decision.\n\nThe sister's reaction is interesting. She agrees with the brother's inclusion but maybe doesn't see the full extent of his issues. The writer has to protect the business and their family's interests. They might be in the right because they have a right to choose their business partners based on capability and trust. The brother's outburst shows he's not handling rejection well, which isn't the writer's fault.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the writer isn't at fault. They made a tough but necessary decision for the business's sake. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
