Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author of the gym business run by a family, and they have an adopted \"brother\" who is now 22. The author is being questioned about whether they were wrong to tell this adopted brother he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author started the business with their father, and after the father's death, they have their blood siblings involved in management. The adopted brother, who's not legally part of the family, was taken in when he was young due to the mother's religious and giving nature. However, the author describes him as difficult, with issues like alcoholism and criminal behavior. The author gave him a part-time job and allowed his personal trainer business to promote at the gyms, but now the adopted brother is asking for a promotion to assistant manager. The author denied the request, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related, which led to an outburst from the adopted brother.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for denying the promotion. They emphasize family trust and keeping the business within the family. However, the adopted brother feels entitled, possibly because he's been introduced as family. The author's response was firm, leading to a confrontation.\n\nLegally and ethically, favoring family in business is common but can lead to conflicts. The author's stance is that the adopted brother isn't blood-related and lacks the qualifications. The brother's behavior (using the father's last name, not respecting boundaries) adds to the tension. The author's sister now thinks the author went too far, which might suggest conflicting views within the family.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's decision was justified. Since the author isn't legally bound to treat the adopted brother as family and the brother's actions (like using the last name, criminal history) show he hasn't respected the family's boundaries, the author's decision might be seen as protecting the business. However, the way the rejection was communicated (pointing out he's not blood) could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother was led to believe he was part of the family. But the author's main point was about qualifications and not family ties, so it's a matter of business decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might not be in the wrong as they're prioritizing the business's best interests and the brother's lack of suitability. However, the emotional impact on the brother and how the message was delivered could be points of contention. But based on the given information, the author's decision seems justified, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
