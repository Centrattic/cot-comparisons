Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a family business and an adopted brother, or rather someone who's considered like a brother but isn't blood-related. The writer says they've given him a part-time job and some opportunities but he's been problematic\u2014like being an alcoholic, getting in trouble, and now asking for a promotion he's not qualified for. He flipped out when told no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The adopted brother isn't legally adopted but is introduced as family. The writer has a business with family members, and they prefer keeping things in the family. They refused the adoptive brother a promotion, citing lack of qualification and not being blood family. The brother got angry and caused damage. The sister thinks the author went too far.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning: he's protecting the business and its values. They feel he's not part of the family, even though they introduced him as such. The brother's actions (using the father's last name, getting in trouble) are a problem. The author might be justified in not promoting him if he's unqualified and has a history of issues. However, introducing him as family might imply some level of commitment. But since it's not legal, maybe the author isn't obligated. \n\nOn the other hand, the adopted brother feels entitled. The author might be in the right because it's their business and they have the right to choose who they trust. However, there's an emotional aspect here\u2014maybe the author wasn't clear about expectations. The brother's reaction was extreme, but the author's response might have been harsh if he didn't explain things properly. \n\nBut the main point is that the author didn't give the promotion for legitimate business reasons. They might be right to prioritize qualified family members. However, if they had a history of treating him as family and giving him opportunities, the brother might feel betrayed. The author might be in the right because it's their business, but maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their reasons are valid. Since they cited qualifications and not being blood, and he has a history of issues, the author's decision seems justified. The sister's opinion might be biased towards the brother. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
