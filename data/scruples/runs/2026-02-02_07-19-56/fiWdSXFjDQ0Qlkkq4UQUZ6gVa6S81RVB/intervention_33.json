Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author runs a gym chain with their late father. They have siblings involved in management and a brother-in-law. The adopted brother, now 22, was taken in as a foster child but never legally adopted. He wants a higher role in the business. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own failing business in the gyms. The adopted brother has a history of alcoholism, legal issues, and seems unqualified. The author told him he's not part of the family and thus not eligible for the assistant manager position. The brother flipped out, slammed a door, and the sister thinks the author went too far.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not a blood relative, lacks qualifications, and has a problematic history. The adopted brother uses the family's last name despite being asked to stop. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nFrom a business perspective, hiring decisions should be based on merit and qualifications. The author didn't give him the position because he's unqualified and has a history of issues. That's reasonable. But they also have a personal relationship. The author might be right to prioritize business needs over sentiment. However, the way they communicated it\u2014saying he's not part of the family\u2014might have been harsh. The sister thinks the author went too far, which suggests family dynamics are important here. The adopted brother was raised by the family, even if not legally, and might feel entitled. The author's response could have been more empathetic. However, the business is a family-run operation, and including someone who's not a blood relative or legally adopted might not be prudent, especially with his track record. The key points are qualifications, business trust, and the family's approach to roles. The author's stance isn't necessarily wrong, but their delivery and the emotional impact on the adopted brother could be seen as harsh. However, given the brother's history and the business context, the author's decision might be justified. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
