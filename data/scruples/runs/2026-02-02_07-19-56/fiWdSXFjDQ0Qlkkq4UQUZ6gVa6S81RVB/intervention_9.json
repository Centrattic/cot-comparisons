Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author rejecting their adopted \"brother\" from a management position in their family business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author runs a gym chain with their siblings. They have a non-blood brother, informally adopted, who's been in their care since he was a kid. He's 22 now, has issues with alcohol, has been in trouble (theft, DUI), and the author feels he's not part of the family anymore. The author gave him a part-time job, allowed him to advertise his own failing business. The brother asked for a promotion to assistant manager, got denied, and reacted badly.\n\nThe author's reasoning: he's not family, not blood, and the brother isn't qualified. The brother used the father's last name, which the author finds upsetting. The author also mentions the brother's poor track record.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. On one hand, the brother was raised by the family, treated as family, but now the author is distancing. The brother's actions (breaking the door, using the last name) might have crossed a line. The author has valid concerns about the brother's reliability and qualifications. \n\nBut the brother's perspective is that he's been part of the family for years, and the author's refusal feels discriminatory. The author is prioritizing blood relations over non-blood, which some might see as unfair, especially if the brother was considered family. However, the author isn't obligated to hire someone just because they were raised together. The brother's behavior (using the last name, not respecting boundaries) could justify the author's stance.\n\nThe author is clear about their reasons. They gave the brother a chance but now are setting boundaries. The brother's reaction was inappropriate, but the author's refusal might be justified given the brother's history. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. However, considering the context, the author's decision seems reasonable. They are not legally bound to treat the brother as family, especially with the brother's past behavior. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a cultural expectation or if the author should have considered the brother's feelings more. The brother was treated as family for years, so maybe the author's sudden distance is harsh. But the author's reasons are clear and about business decisions. Hmm. Maybe it's a nuanced case, but the answer leans towards B.\n"
