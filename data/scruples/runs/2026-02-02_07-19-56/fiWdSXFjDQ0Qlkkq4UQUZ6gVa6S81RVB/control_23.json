Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their father, who passed away. They have biological siblings in management. There's an adopted brother, but he's not legally adopted. The family took him in when he was young, but he's had issues\u2014alcoholism, run-ins with the law. The author gave him part-time work and allowed his personal trainer business in the gyms. Now the adopted brother wants a higher position, like assistant manager. The author refused, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood. The adopted brother reacted angrily, damaging property, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did the right thing. Let's break it down. The author's reasoning is that family business should stay within blood relatives, and the adopted brother isn't qualified. But the adopted brother feels entitled because of being raised as family.\n\nLegally, he's not a sibling, so the author isn't obligated to give him a position. However, the family took him in, which might create some expectations. The author helped raise him, but he's had behavioral issues. The author's stance is about business decisions and trust. On the other hand, the adopted brother might feel hurt and rejected, especially after being part of the family for so long.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a factor. She might feel caught between the author and her brother, especially since she shares past feelings but now thinks the author went too far. The author's refusal might be justified in terms of business needs, but the way they communicated it (telling him he's not real family) could be hurtful. The public statement about not being blood might have been harsh, contributing to the brother's outburst.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has a right to decide who works in their business, especially considering the brother's history. However, the way they handled it could have been more sensitive. Maybe there's a middle ground, like offering more training or a different role, but the author felt he wasn't qualified. The key points are the brother's entitlement versus the author's business judgment and the need for family trust.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have the right to make business decisions based on qualifications and trust. However, the approach might have been a bit harsh. But according to the question, the options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). Given that the author's reasons are based on business needs and the brother's lack of qualifications, I'd lean towards B.\n"
