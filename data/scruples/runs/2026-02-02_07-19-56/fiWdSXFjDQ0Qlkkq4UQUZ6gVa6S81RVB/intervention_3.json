Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a family business with their siblings. There's an adopted brother who isn't legally part of the family but was raised by them. The adopted brother wants a higher position in the business and was told no. The author gave him a part-time job but he's not qualified for the assistant manager role. The brother got upset and caused damage, and now the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was clear about not considering him family, maybe even harshly. But was it wrong? Well, the brother isn't legally family, but they were raised by the author's mother. The author might have a right to be protective about the business, especially after the brother's past issues\u2014like alcoholism, getting arrested, and not being reliable. The brother might feel entitled because he was introduced as family, which could create resentment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled the rejection more sensitively. Telling someone they're not part of the family might be hurtful, even if it's true. The brother's reaction (damaging the door) is extreme, but the author's blunt approach could have contributed to that. The sister's reaction suggests there's a family rift here.\n\nI need to consider if the author overstepped. The author has the right to decide who joins the business, especially as the leader. But the way they communicated it might have been unnecessarily harsh. The brother might feel wronged because he was treated as family publicly but not in business decisions. The author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting their business, but maybe they could have been more empathetic. \n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if A or B. The author's response was direct, but given the brother's behavior and the business's needs, maybe the author is justified. However, the emotional response might indicate the author should have handled it differently. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to business decisions and the brother's actions are problematic. But I'm a bit torn. The key is whether the author's explanation of \"not blood\" was unfair. Since the brother isn't legally family, the author's decision isn't wrong, but the manner might be. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just the manner. So B.\n"
