Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their father, now deceased. They have biological siblings and a brother-in-law in the business. The \"adopted\" brother was taken in by their mom when he was a kid, but he's had a lot of issues: alcoholism, legal troubles, and a lack of success. The author gave him a part-time job and allowed him to promote his business, but when he asked for an assistant manager role, the author refused, citing lack of qualification and not being blood family. This led to a confrontation where the brother damaged the door.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the adopted brother's behavior and his demands versus the author's business decisions. The author feels he's not part of the family and doesn't want him in the company. The brother feels wronged because he's been around and the author's family introduced him as family.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, he's not an adopted sibling, so there's no legal family ties. The author is running a business and making decisions about who to promote. The brother's track record is problematic\u2014criminal history, alcoholism, failures in his own business. The author might be justified in not promoting him due to these issues. Also, the author mentions the brother uses their father's last name, which is a sensitive issue, and the author asked him to stop, but he didn't. That could be another reason for the refusal.\n\nHowever, there's a question about fairness. The author is giving different treatment based on family status. The brother might feel that since he was raised by the family, he deserves the same consideration. But the author is making a business decision, not a family one. In a business context, qualifications and reliability are key. The brother's history includes multiple issues that make him a bad fit for a managerial role. The author's refusal is based on practical business reasons rather than just family ties.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a point. She might support the brother's feelings, but the author is standing by their decision. The author's stance is that they can't see the brother as family anymore. The key is whether the author is being unfair or if they have a valid reason. Given the brother's behavior and the business needs, the author's position seems justified. The answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they are making a business decision based on the brother's history and the need for trust in family business.\n"
