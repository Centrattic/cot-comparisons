Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for refusing the \"adopted brother\" a position in the family business. The author runs a gym chain with family members, and the \"brother\" was taken in as a foster child but isn't legally adopted. The author gave him a part-time job but now he's demanding a managerial role. The author says he's unqualified, has a history of issues, and isn't blood-related. He refused the promotion, leading to a conflict where the brother got angry and damaged the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the brother isn't blood-related, which is a key point. The author values keeping the business within the family, which is common. However, the brother was treated as part of the family, even given a part-time job. The author's refusal is based on qualifications and blood relation, which might be seen as discriminatory. But the brother's behavior (alcoholism, criminal record) is also a factor. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother isn't qualified and isn't blood. But the brother might feel entitled because he was part of the family. However, the author isn't obligated to hire family members in a professional setting. On the other hand, the author did give him a job, so there's a history of support. The brother's outburst is problematic, but the author's refusal might be justified due to the brother's lack of qualifications and past behavior. \n\nLegally, the author can choose who to hire, even if it's family. Ethically, it's complicated. The author tried to help the brother but now feels he's not contributing. The brother's entitlement could be an issue. The author's refusal might be fair, especially if the brother isn't qualified. However, the way the author handled it (saying \"you're not my blood\") could come off as harsh. The brother's reaction was inappropriate, but the author's justification was based on merit and qualifications. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because hiring decisions can be based on merit, and the brother's history is a valid concern. However, the way the author communicated the refusal might have been insensitive. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the facts, the author's decision is defensible. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
