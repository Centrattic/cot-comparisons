Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author's adopted \"brother\" wanting a job in the family business. The author started the business with their dad, now the dad is gone, and the real siblings have management roles. The adopted brother was fostered by their mom after his biological mom left him, and they've raised him. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own business there. But now the adopted brother is asking for an assistant manager position. The author says no, citing lack of qualification and not being blood. The adopted brother got angry, damaged the door, and the sister is upset.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: they value family in the business, trust them, and have a history. The adopted brother was difficult to raise, has a history of alcoholism, been in jail for theft and DUI, and the author doesn't see him as family anymore. They mention he uses the author's father's last name despite being told not to. The author feels he's a burden and not useful.\n\nThe sister's reaction is that the author went too far. She might have felt that the author was being harsh by emphasizing blood relation. The adopted brother might have felt that since they were raised together and introduced as family, he's entitled to a position. The author's reasoning is about qualifications and not being family, but the way they delivered it might have been hurtful.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. The author's actions: denying a job based on not being blood, even though the adopted brother is not legally part of the family. However, the brother was raised by them and considered family. The author's justification is about trust and business success, but maybe they should have handled it more sensitively. The key points are the brother's qualifications, past behavior, and the author's right to decide business roles. The sister's support in the past vs. her current reaction. The brother's outburst could be a result of feeling betrayed. The author's harshness might have been unnecessary, even though the decision itself isn't wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have considered the brother's feelings and perhaps offered a different position or explained more thoroughly. But the brother's history does give the author a reason to be cautious. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because while the approach could be improved, the decision to prioritize qualifications and blood family in a business context is reasonable given the brother's history.\n"
