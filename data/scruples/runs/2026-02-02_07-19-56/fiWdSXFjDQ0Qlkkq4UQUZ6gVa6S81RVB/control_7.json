Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author runs a family business with their siblings and brother-in-law. They have an unofficially adopted brother who's 22, part of the family since he was a child, but now has issues with alcohol, criminal records, and poor work ethic. The author gave him a part-time job and let him promote his own business at the gyms. The adopted brother wants a higher position, like assistant manager, but the author refused, explaining he's not qualified and not family. The adopted brother reacts angrily, causing damage, and the sister sides with him now.\n\nThe key points here are family dynamics, business decisions, and the relationship between the author and the adopted brother. The author feels that the adopted brother isn't a real sibling and doesn't deserve the same opportunities as their blood siblings. However, the adopted brother was raised by the family, even if not legally, and the mother considered him part of the family. The author's refusal might be seen as discriminatory because it's based on blood relation rather than merit, especially if the adopted brother has been part of the family for so long.\n\nBut the author also has a business to run and needs reliable people. The adopted brother's history of issues (alcohol, jail) might make the author's decision understandable from a business perspective. However, the way the author expressed it\u2014saying he's not part of the family\u2014could be hurtful and might affect workplace dynamics if the adopted brother is an employee.\n\nThe sister's reaction is another factor. She might feel the author is being unfair, especially if she has a different view of the adopted brother. The author's sister's support is important in family matters, and her disagreement could indicate that the author's approach is causing family strife.\n\nLegally, the adopted brother isn't family, but emotionally and in terms of upbringing, he was part of the family. The author might have a right to prioritize blood relatives in business roles, but the harshness of the response and the lack of consideration for the adopted brother's feelings could make the author wrong. Also, the author's sister's support for the adopted brother suggests that the author's actions are causing division.\n\nIn the end, it's a mix of business and family. The author's decision might be justified in terms of business needs, but the way it was handled\u2014publicly declaring the adopted brother not family\u2014could be seen as wrong because it's hurtful and might not be the best approach for maintaining family harmony and a positive work environment. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the refusal was based on blood relation rather than merit and the handling of the situation was harsh.\n"
