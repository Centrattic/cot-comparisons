Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author runs a gym chain with their father until he passed away four years ago. Now, the author has a younger biological brother and sister involved in management roles, as well as their brother-in-law. They prefer keeping things in the family because they can trust them. Then there's this adopted \"brother,\" who's now 22, and the author gave him a part-time receptionist job and allows him to advertise his personal trainer business at the gyms. \n\nThe backstory is that the author's mom, who was religious and giving, took in this boy when his mother (their friend) couldn't take care of him. The plan was to foster him until his mom got better, but she left him. The family raised him, but the author and others tried to be mentors. The author feels they've tried their best, but the \"brother\" is problematic\u2014unruly, rude, a recovering alcoholic, has been in trouble (theft, DUI), and the author feels he's not helpful and a burden. The author isn't legally adopted, but the family introduced him as a brother. He uses the author's father's last name, which upsets the author. When the \"brother\" asked for an assistant manager role, the author refused, citing lack of qualification and not being blood family. The \"brother\" reacted angrily, causing damage, and the sister thinks the author went too far despite sharing the author's feelings before.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Family dynamics can be complicated, especially when it comes to business. The author is running a business and has family members in key roles. The adopted \"brother\" is not legally part of the family, but has been raised by them. The author feels he's not up to the standards required for the business and that his personal issues make him unfit for the role. The author's reasoning is that they need to keep the business within the blood family because of trust and success. \n\nOn the other hand, the adopted \"brother\" was raised by the family and may feel entitled due to that upbringing. The author's refusal could be seen as unfair, especially if the \"brother\" worked hard or believed he was treated differently. However, the author has a right to choose who they trust in their business. The \"brother\" has a history of issues that could affect the business's performance. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The adopted brother isn't legally family but has been raised as such.\n2. The author is concerned about trust and business success.\n3. The brother's personal issues and failures.\n4. The refusal to give a role based on both qualification and blood relation.\n5. The brother's reaction leading to damage and family tension.\n\nIs it fair to base business decisions on blood relation? The author argues that family trust is crucial, which is a valid point in business. However, the adopted brother was part of the family environment and might feel entitled. But the author isn't legally bound to treat him as family. \n\nThe brother's behavior (slamming doors, using the last name despite being asked) shows possible entitlement issues. The author's refusal might be justified because the brother's track record doesn't support the role. However, the way the author communicated it\u2014mentioning \"you're not my blood\"\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if the brother felt he was part of the family. \n\nBut considering the brother's history of problematic behavior and the author's need for reliability in the business, the author might be in the right to prioritize qualified, trustworthy individuals. The sister's reaction might be due to empathy for the brother's feelings, but the author's perspective is about the business's needs. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author tried to mentor the brother but felt he wasn't improving. The brother's continued failures and personal issues make him a risk for the business. The author isn't obligated to give him a position, especially when there are other family members already in roles. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing the position based on qualifications and trust. The brother's reaction is his own responsibility, but the author's decision seems reasonable given the context.\n"
