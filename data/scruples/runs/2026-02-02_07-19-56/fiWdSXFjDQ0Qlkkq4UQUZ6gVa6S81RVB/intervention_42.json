Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their father, who's passed away. They have siblings and a brother-in-law involved. There's also this adopted brother who's been in their family since he was a kid, but he's had issues\u2014rude, unruly, alcoholism, legal troubles. The author gave him a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his own business. Now the adopted brother wants a managerial role, and when the author said no, there was a confrontation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the brother isn't qualified and isn't blood-related. The adopted brother feels rejected and flipped out. The sister thinks the author went too far, but the author feels justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's stance on family business being for blood relatives, the adopted brother's behavior and lack of qualifications, and the conflict that arose from the rejection.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author might be seen as prioritizing their own family, which is common in family businesses. However, the adopted brother has been raised by them, and the mother allowed the use of the last name. The author is now denying him opportunities because he's not blood-related, which could be seen as discriminatory. But the author also mentions the brother's lack of qualifications and problematic behavior, which are valid business concerns.\n\nThe sister's reaction is that the author went too far, but maybe she's more empathetic towards the adopted brother. The author's frustration is understandable given the brother's history of causing trouble. However, the way the author handled the situation (publicly stating he's not part of the family) might have been harsh. Maybe there was a better way to communicate the decision without invalidating the adopted brother's feelings.\n\nBut the author's main point is about business decisions. In a family business, it's common to prioritize blood relatives, but non-blood family members who are considered part of the family might expect some consideration. However, if the person isn't qualified and has a history of issues, the business decision to not promote them might be justified. The problem is the way it was communicated, emphasizing the lack of blood relation, which might be insensitive.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not giving the position, but the method and the harsh words could be where they're in the wrong. However, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning (not blood) is a valid business decision or if it's unfair given the adopted brother's role in the family.\n\nIn business, it's their right to choose who they want to hire, especially if the person doesn't meet the qualifications. The adopted brother's legal status isn't adoption, but they introduced him as family. So, the author could argue that they're making a business decision based on merit. However, the emotional aspect of rejecting someone who's been considered family might make the author look heartless, even if it's justified.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the business decision is based on merit and qualifications, but maybe there's a nuanced answer. However, since the user is unsure and the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer is likely B because the author isn't obligated to give a position to someone not qualified, even if they were raised as family. The conflict arises from expectations, but the author's decision is business-based.\n"
