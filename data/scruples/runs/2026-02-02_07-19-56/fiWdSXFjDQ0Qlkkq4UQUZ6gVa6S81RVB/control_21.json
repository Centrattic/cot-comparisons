Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a position in the business.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a family gym business with their real siblings and brother-in-law. They had an unofficially adopted brother, raised from a young age by their mother. Now the adopted brother is 22, wants to be an assistant manager, but the author feels he's not qualified or part of the family. The author told him he's not family, leading to a conflict where the adopted brother got angry and damaged the door. The sister is upset with the author now.\n\nThe key points here are about family dynamics, business decisions, and the emotional impact. The adopted brother wasn't legally adopted but was raised as family. The author's stance is that he's not blood family and not qualified. The sister bailed him out of DUI, but the author has different feelings. The adopted brother's actions (using the last name, pushing for the job) are causing stress.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about balancing personal feelings with fairness. The author might have a right to be protective of their business, especially since they started it with their father. However, they've been treating the adopted brother as family for a long time, even allowing him part-time work and advertising his own business. When he asked for more responsibility, the author denied it based on not being blood family. That could be seen as inconsistent or unfair, especially if the adopted brother felt he was part of the family.\n\nThe sister's reaction is important too. If she used to share the author's feelings but now thinks they went too far, maybe the author was too harsh. The adopted brother's behavior (slamming the door) is poor, but the question is whether the author's response was wrong. \n\nThe author might be in the right for not giving a job to someone who isn't qualified and has a history of issues. But the way they handled it by emphasizing not being blood could hurt the adopted brother's feelings. The sister might expect more inclusion, especially if the adopted brother has been part of the family for so long. \n\nAlso, the fact that the adopted brother isn't legally part of the family might mean the author isn't obligated to give him a position, but they had a history of support. The author's refusal, while justified on a professional level, could be seen as cutting ties abruptly. \n\nI think the author's main issue is the abruptness and the statement about not being family. If they wanted to keep the relationship but set boundaries, maybe a different approach would be better. But since it's a family business, the author might prioritize those they can trust. The adopted brother's actions (using the last name despite being asked to stop) show a lack of respect, which might justify the author's stance. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have to protect the business and can't be forced to hire someone unqualified. However, the handling could be seen as harsh. But in AITA terms, the core issue is the business decision and the relationship. The author's honesty in setting boundaries is necessary, even if it's painful.\n"
