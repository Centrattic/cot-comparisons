Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the original poster is at fault here. So, the situation is that they run a gym chain with their father, who passed away four years ago. They have two biological siblings involved in management and their brother-in-law. They also have an adopted \"brother,\" now 22, who came into the family through their mother's fostering. The user gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his personal training business.\n\nThe adopted brother now wants a promotion to assistant manager. The user told him he's not qualified and isn't family. The adopted brother got angry, cracked a glass door, and the sister thinks the user went too far.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user was wrong to deny the adopted brother the position. The user mentions that the adopted brother has a history of issues: alcoholism, being in jail for theft, DUIs. They also mention he's unqualified and lacks the drive to succeed, despite having advantages. The user feels he's not a real sibling but more of an annoyance. The adopted brother uses the family's last name, which the user finds offensive.\n\nThe user's reasoning for not giving him the job is based on both qualifications and blood relation. However, the adopted brother isn't legally part of the family, even though they present him as such. The user's stance is that they want to keep the business within the actual family, which they trust.\n\nBut here's the thing: just because someone isn't blood-related doesn't mean they shouldn't be considered for a position if they're qualified. However, the user is under no obligation to hire family members or non-family members. The problem might be in how the user communicated their decision, especially if it was harsh or dismissive. Also, the user's sister now thinks they went too far, so there's family tension involved.\n\nThe user's sister might have been supportive in the past, but now she's siding with the adopted brother. The user's sister's reaction could indicate that the way the user handled the situation was inappropriate, even if the decision itself is understandable.\n\nBut the user's main points are about the person's unfitness for the role and their lack of qualifications. If the user is making a business decision based on merit, that's one thing. However, if the user is being discriminatory by not considering him because he's not blood-related, even if he were qualified, that would be a problem. However, in this case, the user claims he's not qualified anyway.\n\nThe adopted brother's behavior (slamming the door) is his own fault, but the user's decision might have been the catalyst. The user's frustration is valid given the brother's history, but the way they expressed their decision might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical aspects, the user isn't required to hire family members, and they can choose to keep the business within their immediate family. However, if the adopted brother is an employee, the user should handle promotions based on qualifications, not just family ties. But since the user is already giving him a part-time job, maybe there's an expectation of fairness. However, the user might not be obligated to offer positions to non-family members unless there's a prior agreement.\n\nThe user's sister's disapproval is a red flag. It might mean that the user's approach was too harsh or that there's an expectation in the family to include the adopted brother, even if he's not the best fit. The user's sister might feel protective or see the adopted brother as family despite his issues.\n\nIn conclusion, the user is making a business decision based on merit and family trust, which is their right. However, the way they communicated the decision and the sister's reaction might indicate that the user's approach was too abrasive. But ultimately, the user isn't in the wrong for not promoting someone who isn't qualified and isn't part of the actual family, especially given the brother's history. The problem might be more about the brother's behavior than the user's decision.\n"
