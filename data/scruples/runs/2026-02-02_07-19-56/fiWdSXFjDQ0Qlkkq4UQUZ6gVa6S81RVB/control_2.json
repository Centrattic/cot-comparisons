Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for telling their adopted \"brother\" that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author runs a family business with their siblings. They have a younger biological brother and sister involved, as well as a brother-in-law. The \"adopted\" brother in question was taken in by their mother, raised as part of the family, but isn't legally adopted. He's 22, has a history of alcoholism, criminal issues (theft, DUI), and is currently working part-time at the gym but has a failing personal trainer business. He asked for a promotion to assistant manager, was denied, and reacted by slamming a door, causing damage. The author told him he's not family because he's not blood-related.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the treatment of the adopted brother, the reasoning behind denying the position, and the reaction of the adopted brother.\n\nThe author mentions that the adopted brother was difficult to raise, had behavioral issues, and continues to have problems. They feel he's unqualified and not part of their family, hence not deserving the same opportunities as their blood siblings. The adopted brother, however, feels entitled because he's been introduced as family and uses the family name.\n\nLegally, adoption isn't necessary for someone to be considered family in a social sense, especially if they were raised together. However, businesses often prioritize family ties for trust and reliability. The author's business is family-run, and they've given the adopted brother a part-time role. The demand for a promotion might be seen as unreasonable if he lacks the qualifications and experience compared to the siblings. The author's refusal based on being \"not blood\" could be problematic because it dismisses the social and emotional bond, even if legally not adopted. However, the author's business decisions are their own, and they have the right to choose who they trust with responsibility.\n\nThe adopted brother's reaction (damaging property) is concerning, but the author's statement that the brother isn't family might have been harsh, especially if the brother genuinely believes he belongs. The author's sister's reaction suggests that maybe the author was too harsh, even though they've shared their feelings before.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author has the right to manage their business as they see fit, but the way they communicated the rejection might be seen as hurtful. The brother's entitlement and the author's frustration are both factors. The author's reasoning about not being blood could be seen as discriminatory if the brother was treated as family in other contexts. However, the author's business decisions are their own, and they aren't obligated to give positions based on perceived family status if they don't believe it applies.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for denying the position based on qualifications and business needs, but the way they communicated it (emphasizing blood relation) could be seen as insensitive. However, the core issue is the business decision, which they have the right to make. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but the communication could be an issue. But based on the question's options, the answer is likely B.\n"
