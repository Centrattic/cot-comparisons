Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a business position. \n\nFirst, the context: the author has a family business with their real siblings and brother-in-law. They have an unofficial adopted brother who's been part of their family since he was a kid. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own business. The adopted brother has a history of issues, including alcoholism, jail time for theft, and DUI. The author feels he's not qualified and isn't family, so they refused his request for a promotion to assistant manager. The adopted brother got angry and cracked a door, and the author's sister now thinks they went too far.\n\nSo, the key points here are about family dynamics, employment decisions, and how the author communicated their decision. The author's reasoning is that they're keeping the business within blood relatives, which is common, but the adopted brother feels entitled. The author also mentions that the adopted brother uses their father's last name, which upsets them. \n\nThe author's actions: they told the brother he's not part of the family, which might have been harsh. But considering the brother's behavior and lack of qualifications, the author's refusal might be justified. However, the way they communicated it could be problematic. The adopted brother's reaction (slamming the door) suggests he felt disrespected or betrayed. \n\nThe sister's opinion that the author went too far is a point to consider. While the author might have a valid reason for not promoting him, the manner of telling him he's not family could be seen as cutting ties in a hurtful way. The author also mentions the brother is an \"annoyance\" and served \"no use,\" which could come across as dismissive. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the author isn't obligated to hire the adopted brother just because he's been part of the family. However, if the brother was led to believe he was part of the family, the author's sudden rejection might have caused emotional harm. The brother's history of problematic behavior supports the author's decision, but the way it was handled might be where the author is in the wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. They have valid reasons for not promoting him, but the approach taken could be seen as unkind or dismissive. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the brother's behavior and the need to maintain business integrity. But the way they phrased their refusal, emphasizing non-blood relation, might have been unnecessarily harsh, leading to the conflict. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's reasoning is acceptable. Since the brother isn't legally part of the family and the author has a right to choose business roles based on qualifications and trust, the decision itself isn't wrong. However, the communication style might be where the author is at fault. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. Wait, but the user is uncertain. \n\nWait, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate objectively. The author's decision is based on family ties and the brother's unfitness. The problem is that the brother was raised in the family, leading him to expect some level of inclusion. The author might not be in the wrong for making a business decision based on merit, but the way they communicated it could be problematic. However, considering the brother's history, the author has a right to prioritize the business's success. \n\nHmm. The core question is about the author's justification for the decision. Since the brother isn't blood-related and has a poor work history, the author's refusal is justified. The problem might be the harshness of the message, but the content of the message (not being family) is a valid reason. The author isn't in the wrong for stating the facts, even if it's hurtful. So the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, the user's initial thought is A. Need to check again. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author had a right to make that statement. Since the brother isn't legally part of the family, the author is correct in stating that he's not family. The author's business decision is based on merit and family ties, which are legitimate. The conflict arises from the brother's expectations versus reality. The author isn't in the wrong for making a tough decision, even if it's hurtful. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
