Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling his adopted brother, who's not part of the family, that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, the context: The author runs a gym chain with his family, involving his blood siblings and brother-in-law. The \"adopted brother\" was taken in when young, but now 22, has issues like alcoholism, was in jail for theft and DUI, and the author has given him a part-time receptionist job. The adoptee wants a promotion to assistant manager, which the author refuses, citing lack of qualification and not being blood family. The adoptee got angry, broke a door, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that he's keeping the business within the actual family, not the adopted one. But the adoptee was raised by them, even if not legally adopted. The author's mom took him in, and they introduced him as family. The adoptee uses the father's last name, which upsets the author.\n\nThe author's stance is about trust and family business dynamics. But the adoptee might feel entitled because he was raised as a sibling. The key points are: the author is being honest about not considering him family, but maybe the way he communicated it was harsh? The adoptee's behavior (breaking the door, past issues) suggests he's not a stable person. The author might be protecting the business from someone who isn't capable, but the way he dismissed him as \"not family\" could be hurtful, especially if there was an expectation of being part of the family.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a point\u2014she shared the author's past feelings but now thinks he went too far. Maybe the author should have explained the reasons more carefully or offered support instead of just stating he's not family. However, the author also has the right to decide who he trusts with business roles. The adoptee's lack of qualifications and history might justify the refusal. The main conflict is between the author's business needs and the adoptee's sense of belonging. The answer might hinge on whether the author's refusal was justified based on capability and trust, not just blood relation. But the way he phrased it (\"you're not my blood\") might be seen as dismissive and invalidating of the adoptee's feelings, even if the author is not legally bound to consider him family. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not promoting him but could be wrong in the delivery. But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. Since the adoptee's demands were unreasonable and the author provided valid reasons, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the emotional aspect complicates it. Hmm.\n"
