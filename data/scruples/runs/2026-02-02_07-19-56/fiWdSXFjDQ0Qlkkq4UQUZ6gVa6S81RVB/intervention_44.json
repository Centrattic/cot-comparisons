Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author rejecting an adopted \"brother\" from taking a higher position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author runs a gym chain with family members. The adopted brother, now 22, was taken in when he was a child. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his PT business. But the brother is problematic\u2014unruly, a recovering alcoholic, has been in jail for theft and DUI. The author doesn't see him as family anymore and refused his request for a managerial position, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related. The brother got angry, damaged a door, and the sister thinks the author went too far.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified. The author has a right to run their business as they see fit, especially wanting to keep it within the family. The brother's behavior and lack of qualifications are valid concerns. However, the way the author handled it might be an issue. Dismissing him as not family could hurt the brother's feelings, especially since they introduced him as family. The author also asked him to stop using the father's last name, which might have built up resentment.\n\nBut the brother's actions (slamming the door, pushing for a position he's not qualified for) are also problematic. The author's main points are valid: the brother isn't qualified and isn't blood-related. The author isn't obligated to give him a promotion. The sister's reaction might be due to not seeing the brother's negative traits. The author's decision seems justified, but the way they expressed it (emphasizing blood relation) could be harsh. However, in business, it's common to prioritize family members. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but might need to handle it more sensitively. Still, the core decision to not promote him seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
