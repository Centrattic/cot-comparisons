Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author runs a gym chain with family members. They have real siblings who are in management roles. The adopted \"brother\" is 22, was taken in by the family due to his mother's friend's issues, but has a history of problematic behavior: he's a recovering alcoholic, been arrested for theft and DUI, and is described as someone who doesn't adapt well. The author gave him a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his PT business. The adopted brother wanted an assistant manager role, was told no, and reacted violently by breaking a door. The author's sister thinks they went too far.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the adopted brother isn't blood-related and isn't qualified. The brother uses their father's last name, which the author is upset about. The author feels he's not a real sibling but an annoyance. The question is if they were wrong to refuse the position and tell him he's not family.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics and business ethics. The business is a family-run operation, and keeping it within blood relatives might be a common practice. However, the adopted brother was raised by the family, even if not legally adopted. The author's mother took him in as a favor, so there's a history of care. But the brother's behavior is problematic. The author has tried to mentor him without success. \n\nThe author's refusal based on not being blood-related could be seen as discriminatory if they're offering positions to blood relatives without considering merit. However, the brother's lack of qualifications and issues might justify the author's decision. The violent reaction from the brother complicates things. The sister's opinion that the author went too far suggests there's family tension. \n\nBut in terms of being in the wrong, the author made a business decision based on qualifications and family trust. The brother's demands might be unreasonable given his track record. The author's stance could be justified, but the way they phrased it (\"not part of our family\") might have been harsh. However, the core issue is whether the author was wrong in the decision itself. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's reasoning was fair. Since the brother isn't qualified and the business is family-run, the author might not be in the wrong. The key is that the author provided reasons related to qualifications and blood relation, not just the latter. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
