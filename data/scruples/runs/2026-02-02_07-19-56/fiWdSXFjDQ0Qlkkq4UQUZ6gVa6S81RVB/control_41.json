Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their father, who passed away. They have real siblings in management roles and a brother-in-law involved. The adopted brother, who's been part of their family since he was a child, is asking for a promotion to assistant manager. The author refuses, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related. The adopted brother gets angry and causes damage.\n\nSo, the key points here are family dynamics, business decisions, and the treatment of the adopted sibling. The author is trying to keep the business within their actual family, which is understandable. They mention that the adopted brother has a history of issues\u2014alcoholism, legal problems, and not adapting well. The author feels he's not a real sibling and sees him as a burden.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for saying he's not part of the family? Well, legally, he's not adopted, even though they introduced him as a brother. In terms of family business, prioritizing blood relatives is common, especially if trust and reliability are factors. The author has real siblings in management roles, so it's not about favoritism over them. The adopted brother might feel entitled because of being raised in the family, but the author isn't obligated to treat him as family legally or in business terms.\n\nHowever, the way the author addressed it might be harsh. Telling someone they're not part of the family can be hurtful, even if it's true. The author's tone and the message could have been delivered more sensitively. Also, the brother's reaction (damaging property) suggests there's underlying tension that the author might not have addressed constructively.\n\nBut considering the adopted brother's behavior and the author's responsibilities as a business owner, the decision to not promote him seems justified. The author has valid reasons based on the brother's unqualified status, past issues, and the need for trust in the business. The main issue is whether the method of communication was appropriate, not the decision itself.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the refusal to promote was fair. Since the brother isn't a blood relative and has a problematic history, the author's decision makes sense. The real question is about the delivery, but in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about the action rather than the intent. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it more compassionately.\n"
