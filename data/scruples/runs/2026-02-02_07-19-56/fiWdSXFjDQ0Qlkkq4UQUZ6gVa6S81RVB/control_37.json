Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a family business and whether the author was right to tell their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a promotion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author runs a gym chain with their father, who passed away. They have siblings in management, a brother-in-law involved, and they prefer keeping the business within the family. The \"adopted brother\" is 22, was taken in by their mother, but is now problematic\u2014alcoholic, has been arrested, and is unqualified. The author gave him a part-time job but when he asked for an assistant manager role, they said no, citing he's not qualified and not family. The brother got angry, broke a door, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author is in a family business and wants to keep it within blood relatives. The brother in question isn't legally adopted but was raised by them. The author tried to mentor him, but he's failed and has a bad track record. The author rejected him for a position he's not qualified for and made it clear they don't consider him family. The brother reacted violently.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the author is justified in not promoting someone who isn't qualified and has a history of issues. It's their business, and they have the right to choose who they hire. The fact that the brother isn't blood-related is a valid reason, especially if they're trying to keep the business in the family. The author also tried to help him, giving him a part-time job and allowing his business to advertise there. But the brother's behavior shows he's not ready for responsibility.\n\nHowever, there's the emotional aspect. The brother was raised by them, and the author's harsh words might have been insensitive. The sister is upset, thinking the author went too far. But the author's position is that they've tried their best, and the brother hasn't improved. The key here is whether the author's response was fair. Telling someone they're not family is harsh, but the brother was already using the family name inappropriately, which the author found offensive. The author's refusal to promote him was based on genuine concerns about his qualifications and the business's needs.\n\nThe brother's reaction is also a problem. Damaging property and getting angry shows poor behavior, which the author had reason to be concerned about. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially when the brother has a history of causing issues. The fact that the author tried to be a mentor and the brother failed doesn't make the author at fault for not promoting him. The answer is likely B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
