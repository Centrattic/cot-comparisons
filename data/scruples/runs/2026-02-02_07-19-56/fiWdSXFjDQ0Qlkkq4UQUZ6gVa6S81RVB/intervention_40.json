Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's family has cared for this person since he was a child, but he's been problematic\u2014unruly, an alcoholic, has legal issues, and doesn't contribute meaningfully. The author gave him a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his own business. Now the person is asking for a promotion to assistant manager, which the author denies, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the idea of keeping the business in the blood family. But the person in question isn't legally adopted, even though they're introduced as family. The author feels resentment and doesn't see him as a sibling, leading to a conflict.\n\nLegally, the person isn't family, but emotionally and socially, they've been part of the family for years. The author's rejection might be seen as harsh, but given the person's history of issues and the author's justified concerns about trust and capability, maybe it's a business decision. The author is running a business and needs reliable people. The person's past behavior (jail, DUI, using the family name without permission) could be valid reasons to not promote him.\n\nHowever, the way the author communicated it\u2014saying he's not part of the family\u2014might be hurtful, especially since the family has treated him as such, even if not legally. The sister's reaction suggests there's family support for him. The author might be in the right in the business decision but in the wrong in the way they expressed it, hurting feelings. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nConsidering the person's qualifications and track record, the author's decision could be justified. The key is whether the author had a valid business reason, which they do. The emotional aspect is a separate issue. So the answer might be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
