  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author running a family business and an adopted \"brother\" who's been part of their family since childhood but is now causing issues. \n\nFirst, the key points: The adopted brother isn't legally adopted but is considered family by the author's mother. He was taken in when he was a child, but the author found him hard to raise, and he's had problems with alcohol and legal issues. The author gave him a part-time receptionist job and let him advertise his personal trainer business. Now, the adopted brother wants a more responsible position as assistant manager, which the author denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. The brother reacted angrily, damaging the door and causing a rift with the sister.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to consider the context. The adopted brother was part of the family for years, but the author never wanted to adopt him legally. The brother's behavior has been problematic, including alcoholism and jail time. The author's real siblings are in management roles, which might be a point the brother is sensitive about. The author is clear about their stance, but the brother's reaction is extreme.\n\nPossible angles: The author is being honest about family dynamics and business choices. Family businesses often prioritize blood relatives for roles, especially when trust is a factor. The adopted brother's lack of qualifications and problematic history might justify the author's decision. However, the author introduced him as a brother and allowed him to use the family name, which could imply a level of commitment that wasn't legally binding. The brother's outburst is concerning, but the author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong if based on capability and business needs.\n\nAnother thought: The author's mother fostered the boy, but the author helped raise him. The author's resentment might be justified due to the brother's negative traits and past. However, the way the author handled the situation could be seen as harsh if they didn't give the brother a fair chance. The part-time job and allowing him to use the family name might have given the brother false hope about his role in the business. The author's refusal to promote him could be seen as a necessary business decision but might have been communicated poorly, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't obligated to give someone a position based on their past relationship, even if they were raised as family. The brother's demands and actions (damaging the door) are on his side. The author's reasons for refusing are valid\u2014lack of qualification and family ties not being the only factor in business roles. The sister's reaction might be because she believes in the brother's worth despite his issues, but the author's perspective is about business sustainability and personal boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries, especially in a business context, and the brother's actions and history are problematic. However, it's a close call because the author might have handled the rejection more sensitively, but the core decision seems reasonable.\n"
