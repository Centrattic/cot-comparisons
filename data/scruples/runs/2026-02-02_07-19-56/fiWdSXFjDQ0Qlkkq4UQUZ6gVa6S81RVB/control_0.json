Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their siblings since their dad passed away. They have a step-brother (or someone they consider an adopted brother) who's 22, has issues with alcohol, has been in trouble with the law, and isn't performing well in his part-time receptionist job. The step-brother wanted to become an assistant manager, but the author refused, stating he's not qualified and not blood-related. The step-brother got angry and damaged the door.\n\nNow, the key points here are the family dynamics, the business decisions, and the treatment of the step-brother. The author is clear that they don't see him as a sibling and have given him chances but he's not meeting expectations. The step-brother uses their dad's last name despite being told not to, which angers the author.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. In business, favoring family is common, but there might be issues of fairness. However, the step-brother isn't a legal family member, and the author has given him a part-time role. The step-brother's behavior, including criminal history and substance abuse, could make the author hesitant to give him a more responsible position. Also, the author has tried to mentor him but he hasn't responded positively.\n\nOn the other hand, the step-brother might feel entitled because he's been raised by the family and introduced as their brother. The author's refusal might hurt his feelings, but the author's main concern is the business's success and trust. The step-brother's actions in response (damaging the door) are problematic, showing poor handling of rejection.\n\nI should check if the author was unreasonable in their decision. They provided reasons related to qualifications and family ties, which are valid in a business context. The author might not be in the wrong here because they are prioritizing the business's needs and their own family. However, there's a question about how the author communicated this. Were there prior discussions about expectations? The step-brother's history of issues might support the author's decision. \n\nAlso, considering the step-brother's entitlement, the author's stance is about maintaining boundaries. The fact that the step-brother uses the father's name without permission adds to the tension. The author's refusal is to protect the business and family reputation.\n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author's actions seem justified. They aren't obligated to give him a promotion, especially given his performance and history. The answer is likely B (author not in the wrong).\n"
