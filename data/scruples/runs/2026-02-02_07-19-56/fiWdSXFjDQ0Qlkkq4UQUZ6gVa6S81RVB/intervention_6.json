Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author rejecting their adopted \"brother\" from a managerial position in the family business. The adopted brother was brought into the family as a foster child, but now he's causing issues.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the adopted brother has a history of alcoholism, has been jailed for theft, and has a DUI. He's unqualified for the position and the author has had enough of his behavior. The author made it clear that he's not family by blood and thus not eligible for the role. The adopted brother reacted angrily, which led to the sister thinking the author went too far.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is running a business and needs to make decisions based on qualifications and reliability. The adopted brother's track record shows he's not suitable for a managerial role. The author also states he's not considered family, which is a key point. On the other hand, there's a possibility of being seen as harsh or dismissive, especially since the family raised him and introduced him as a brother. However, the author has tried to mentor him without success and the business needs to function well.\n\nThe sister's reaction might indicate family tensions, but the author's decision seems pragmatic. The adopted brother's entitlement and lack of qualifications justify the rejection. The author didn't promise positions to him, and the job was offered to real siblings. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
