Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with family members. They have real siblings and a brother-in-law involved. The adopted brother, who was taken in by their mom when he was four, is now 22. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own PT business. But this guy wants a higher position, like assistant manager. The author refused, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The guy got angry, cracked the door, and the sister thinks the author went too far.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh both sides. The author's perspective: they built the business with their father, trust family, and this guy has a history of issues\u2014alcohol, jail, DUIs, doesn't adapt. They don't see him as family anymore. The guy's side: he was raised by the family, uses their surname, and felt entitled to a position.\n\nLegally, he's not adopted, so maybe the author isn't obligated to treat him as family. But emotionally, the mom took him in, so there's a history. The author might have set expectations of family inclusion, but the guy's behavior led to the author distancing. The author's refusal to promote him based on being non-blood might be seen as unfair if the guy was considered family. However, the author's business reasons (not qualified, history of problems) could justify the decision. The sister's reaction suggests maybe the author didn't handle it well, even if the decision was right. The key is whether the author was wrong to emphasize blood relation. If the author never clarified his status or set boundaries, maybe they share some responsibility. But given the guy's actions and the author's business needs, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the way it was handled, especially the public rejection and the sister's reaction, could indicate poor communication. I'm torn. The author might not be in the wrong for the decision but perhaps in the way they communicated it. But the question is about the decision itself. If the author never presented him as family, then it's their right to prioritize family. If they did present him as family, then maybe they are. The user says he's introduced as family but not legally adopted. The author might have been inconsistent in their treatment. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not clarifying his status earlier. But the main issue is the job decision. If the author made it clear he wasn't family, then not wrong. But if they gave the impression of family, then they might be. The sister's reaction might mean the author didn't communicate their stance well. So, considering all that, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they presented him as family but then rejected him based on blood, leading to the conflict. Alternatively, if the author never truly considered him family, then B. It's a bit ambiguous, but the key is whether the author had the right to treat him as family. Since they introduced him as such, they might have a responsibility to treat him equally in family matters. Hence, maybe A.\n"
