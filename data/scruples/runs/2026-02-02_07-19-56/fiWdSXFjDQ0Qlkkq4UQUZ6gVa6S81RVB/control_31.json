Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted brother he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their family. They have blood siblings and a brother-in-law in management roles. There's also this adopted \"brother,\" who they took in when he was a kid. The guy is 22 now, has a history of bad behavior, is an recovering alcoholic, been to jail for theft, and has a DUI. The author gave him a part-time job and let him promote his own failing business at the gyms. Now the guy wants a promotion to assistant manager, which the author denied, explaining he's not qualified and not family. The guy got angry and broke a door, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong to tell him he's not family. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't legally bound to treat him as family. They took him in out of their mother's compassion, but he's not adopted. The guy seems to have taken advantage of their generosity with his actions. The author is running a business and keeping it in the blood family makes sense for trust and reliability. The guy's behavior (using the father's last name despite being told not to) shows disrespect and entitlement. The author's reasons for not giving him the job are valid\u2014lack of qualifications and not being part of the legal family.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did raise him as a sibling, albeit unofficially. Maybe there's an emotional bond, and the guy feels entitled due to being part of the family environment. The sister's reaction suggests that even though she agrees with the author's feelings, she thinks the author went too far. The author's harshness in stating he's not family might have been hurtful, especially if the guy genuinely believes he is family.\n\nBut considering the guy's history of problems and the author's need to maintain a successful business, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize blood relatives and qualified individuals. The author provided him with a job already, which could be seen as supporting him, but he's not meeting expectations. The author's refusal isn't just about family; it's also about competence. The guy's reaction (breaking the door) indicates he's not handling rejection well, which might reflect his own issues rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nThe key points are: the author isn't legally bound to treat him as family, the guy's lack of qualifications and problematic behavior, and the author's need to keep the business running smoothly with trusted people. So the author is probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
