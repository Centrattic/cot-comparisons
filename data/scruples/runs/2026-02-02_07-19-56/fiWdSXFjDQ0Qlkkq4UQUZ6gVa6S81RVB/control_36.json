Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's adopted \"brother\" wanting a job in the family business, and the author refusing because he's not family by blood.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author runs a family business with their siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother, who was taken in under difficult circumstances, is now 22, has a history of alcoholism, legal issues, and hasn't been successful. The author gave him a part-time job and let him use the gym for his own business. He asked for a promotion to assistant manager, but the author said no, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. The adopted brother got angry and broke a door, and the author's sister is upset with them now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down. The author has a right to choose who to employ, especially in their own business. Family businesses often prioritize family members due to trust and shared values. The adopted brother wasn't legally adopted but was considered part of the family socially. However, the author clearly states that the brother is not seen as a sibling and has a history of problematic behavior.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on qualifications and family ties. But is it fair to deny the job solely because he's not blood family? Even though the brother was raised by them, maybe the author is being discriminatory. On the other hand, the brother's actions (legal issues, alcoholism, not contributing to success) could justify the refusal. The author might be protecting the business from someone with a history of problems.\n\nThe sister's reaction complicates things. Maybe she feels the brother deserves a chance despite his issues. The author's sister might view the brother as family and believes he should be given an opportunity regardless of his background. However, the author's responsibility to the business might override that. \n\nAlso, the brother misuses the family name, which is a point of contention. The author asked him to stop, but he didn't, showing a disregard for their boundaries. This could be a reason to not entrust him with a management role.\n\nBut is the author being harsh? The brother has been under their care since childhood. Maybe there's an expectation of providing for family, even if they aren't blood. But the author isn't legally obligated to do so. The line between family and employees is blurry here. The author's justification is about qualifications and trust. If the brother isn't qualified and has a history of issues, the author's decision is business-oriented. \n\nHowever, the way the author expressed it (\"you're not my blood\") might come off as dismissive and hurtful. Maybe there could have been a more supportive approach, like offering training or mentorship instead of a direct refusal. But the brother's behavior suggests he hasn't been responsive to guidance, so the author's frustration is valid.\n\nIn conclusion, while the brother's actions are problematic, the author's decision to not hire him for a responsible position might be justified based on his behavior and qualifications. The author isn't legally bound to consider him as family, even if they were raised together. However, the manner in which the refusal was communicated could be seen as harsh. The main issue is whether the author is wrong in prioritizing business needs over the brother's request. Considering the brother's history and the author's responsibility to the business, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
