Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a family business with their siblings and brother-in-law. They have a \"brother\" they took in when he was a child because their mother's friend couldn't care for him. The guy was fostered and now uses the author's father's last name. He's 22, has a history of bad behavior, including alcoholism, theft, DUIs, and the author had to bail him out. He's been given a part-time job but is now asking for a promotion to assistant manager. The author said no, explaining he's not qualified and not blood-related. The guy got angry, damaged the door, and the sister thinks the author was too harsh.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's reasons for denying the position (qualification and blood relation), the history of the guy's problematic behavior, and the sister's reaction. \n\nNow, considering family dynamics and business ethics. The author is in a position of authority in their business and may prioritize competence and reliability. The guy in question has a history of issues that could affect the business. Using blood relation as a reason might be seen as discriminatory, especially if the author is using the term \"family\" in a business context. But on the other hand, the author has legal and ethical grounds to choose who they trust for important roles, especially given the guy's track record.\n\nThe sister might think the author was harsh because they've had a long-term relationship, but the author's main concern is the business's success and the guy's unfitness for the role. The fact that he damaged property in a fit of anger adds weight to the author's decision not to trust him with more responsibility.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting boundaries? They might not be, especially if the guy isn't qualified and has a history of problematic behavior. However, using blood relation as a reason could be seen as excluding someone who's considered family. But given the context, the author might have valid concerns about his capabilities and reliability.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong. They have a legitimate business to run, the guy's history is a red flag, and using blood relation as part of the decision might be a way to enforce boundaries given their personal experiences. The sister's opinion doesn't necessarily make the author wrong; it's a matter of business judgment and personal boundaries.\n"
