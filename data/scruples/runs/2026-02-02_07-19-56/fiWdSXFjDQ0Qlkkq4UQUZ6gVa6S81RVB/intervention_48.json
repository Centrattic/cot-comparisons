Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he asked for a position in the business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author runs a family business with their blood siblings and brother-in-law. The \"adopted\" brother was taken in under difficult circumstances\u2014his mother's friend couldn't care for him, so the family fostered him. He's been problematic: unruly as a kid, recovering alcoholic, has been in trouble, and now is causing issues by wanting a higher role without being qualified.\n\nThe author gave him a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his own business. When the guy asked for an assistant manager role, the author refused, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related. The guy got angry, damaged property, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they provided opportunities (part-time job, advertising his business). They have a right to run their business as they see fit, especially if it's family-run. They also had to set boundaries after years of the guy's problematic behavior. On the other hand, maybe the author could have been more supportive, given the family took him in. But the guy's actions (theft, DUIs) and the author's clear qualifications for the role might justify the decision.\n\nThe key points here are: the business is family-run, the author isn't obligated to give positions based on non-blood relations, and the adopted brother's history of issues. The author's refusal seems based on merit and family dynamics. The adopted brother's reaction was extreme, but the author's stance might be justified given the circumstances. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing regarding their responsibility towards him despite the problems.\n"
