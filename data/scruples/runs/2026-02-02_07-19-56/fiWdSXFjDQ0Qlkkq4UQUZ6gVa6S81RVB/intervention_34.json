Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business. \n\nFirst, the context: The author runs a family business with their blood siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother, now 22, was taken in when young, but has a history of problematic behavior\u2014alcoholism, jail time for theft and DUI, and a lack of success despite advantages. They gave him a part-time job and let him use the gyms to promote his failing business. The adopted brother then asked for a promotion to assistant manager, which the author denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. This led to an outburst.\n\nThe key points here are the author's justification for exclusion based on blood relation and the adopted brother's reaction. Legally, the adopted brother isn't family, but socially they've been introduced as such. The author's stance is that they prefer family in leadership roles due to trust and shared values. However, the adopted brother feels entitled, which the author is resisting.\n\nNow, considering fairness and ethics. Family businesses often prioritize blood relatives, but when someone is considered part of the family, especially raised as one, it's a gray area. The author's denial based on blood could be seen as discriminatory if the adopted brother has been treated as family. However, the author also has valid concerns about the brother's performance and behavior. The brother's entitlement and past issues might justify the author's decision, but the way it's handled matters. Telling someone they're not family might be harsh, especially if they've been raised that way. \n\nThe sister's reaction suggests there's internal conflict. The author's actions might be seen as necessary for business integrity, but the emotional impact on the adopted brother is significant. The real question is whether the author's reasoning is valid. If the business is family-run, excluding non-relatives is common, but if the adopted brother has been considered family, the author's denial might lack empathy. However, the brother's track record does support the author's decision. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have to protect the business and family's interests. However, the approach of denying based on blood might be seen as insensitive. The brother's behavior does justify the decision, but the delivery could be more compassionate. Overall, the author's actions are defensible but perhaps not entirely without fault in terms of handling the relationship dynamics.\n"
