Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he isn't part of the family after he asked for a position in the business.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author runs a gym chain and has real siblings and a brother-in-law involved. The adopted brother, who was taken in when he was a kid, is now 22. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own business at the gyms. But the adopted brother has issues: he's an alcoholic, been arrested for theft and DUI, and the author feels he's not a real sibling anymore. The adoptive brother recently asked for an assistant manager role, which the author denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. This led to a confrontation where the adoptive brother got angry and damaged a door.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's keeping the business in the family, which he can trust. The adoptive brother, even though not legally adopted, is treated as family by being introduced as such. The author is upset he uses the father's last name despite being asked to stop. The adoptive brother's reaction was violent, but the author is being called in the question for being the T in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nNow, to decide if the author is wrong. The key points here are family loyalty, business decisions, and how the author communicated the rejection. The author has the right to choose who to hire in their business, especially keeping it within the family. However, the way he rejected the adoptive brother might be harsh, especially since they were raised together. The adoptive brother might feel betrayed since they were considered family, even if not legally. The author's statement that the brother isn't part of the family could be hurtful, but the author's perspective is that trust and responsibility are at stake given the brother's history. The brother's violent reaction is definitely problematic, but does that make the author right? Maybe not, because the author might have handled the rejection more sensitively. However, the author's main point is about qualifications and family trust. The brother's criminal history and lack of qualifications are valid concerns. The author isn't legally obligated to hire him, even if he's part of the household. The issue is more about the emotional impact and whether the author's words were unnecessarily harsh. But ultimately, the author is within their rights to make business decisions based on those factors. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) because he's making a business decision based on merit and family trust, even though the communication could be better. However, if the author's statement was meant to exclude the brother from family in a derogatory way, that's where it might cross into being wrong. But given the brother's history, the author's stance is understandable. So, probably B.\n"
