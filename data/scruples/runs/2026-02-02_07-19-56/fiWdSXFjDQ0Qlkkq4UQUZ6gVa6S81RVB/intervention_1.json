Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after the latter demanded a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author runs a family business with their siblings, and there's an adopted brother figure who was taken in by their mother. This person has had a troubled past, including alcoholism, legal issues, and poor work performance. The author gave him a part-time job and allowed him to promote his own business there. The adopted brother then asked for a promotion to assistant manager, which the author denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The brother reacted angrily, slamming a door and causing damage.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the family's business is kept within blood relatives, which is a common practice. The adopted brother isn't legally adopted but is considered part of the family informally. However, the author doesn't see him as a sibling but more as an annoyance. The adoptee's behavior is problematic, including using the father's last name against the author's wishes, which is a point of contention.\n\nThe author's actions in denying the promotion are based on both capability and familial ties. The question is whether that's justified. On one hand, the author is managing a business and has a right to choose competent employees. On the other hand, the adoptee was raised by the family, which might create expectations of inclusion. However, the adoptee's history of failures and the author's clear discomfort in treating him as family might tip the scales. The author's response to the demand was direct, but was it unfair? The adoptee's entitlement to the position despite his shortcomings could be seen as unreasonable. The author's statement \"you're not my blood\" is harsh but truthful, and the adoptee's reaction seems to stem from feeling slighted, which might be due to his own behavior and lack of qualifications. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They are managing their business and have a right to prioritize qualified family members. The adoptee's issues are self-made, and the author isn't obligated to provide him with a position he isn't suited for. The answer is B.\n"
