Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted brother he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the business. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author runs a gym chain with family members. They have a biological brother and sister involved, plus a brother-in-law. The adopted brother, who's 22, was taken in under difficult circumstances. The author helped raise him but feels he's ungrateful, has issues like alcoholism, and has been in trouble. They gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own business at the gyms. Now he's asking for an assistant manager role, which the author denied, citing lack of qualification and not being blood.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the details: The adopted brother isn't legally adopted but is introduced as such. He uses the father's last name, which the author finds offensive. The author's reasoning for not promoting him is both his qualifications and his blood relation. The brother reacted angrily, causing damage.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. The author's family has a policy of keeping things in the family, which is common in many businesses.\n2. The adopted brother isn't legally part of the family, though they were raised together. \n3. The author's refusal is based on both merit (not qualified) and family ties.\n4. The brother's behavior is problematic, including criminal issues and personal failures.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to exclude him based on not being blood-related. Legally, since he's not adopted, the author might have a right to prioritize biological family. However, ethically, if the adopted brother was considered family, the author's decision could be seen as harsh. However, the brother's behavior and lack of qualifications might justify the decision. The author's main point is about trust and success, which the brother doesn't meet. The use of the last name is another point of contention, showing the author's discomfort with the brother's entitlement.\n\nIn many cases, family businesses do prioritize blood relatives, especially if roles are already filled by them. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially given the brother's history. The author's sister is upset, but that might be because she's more sentimental. The author's stance is about practicality and the business's success. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
