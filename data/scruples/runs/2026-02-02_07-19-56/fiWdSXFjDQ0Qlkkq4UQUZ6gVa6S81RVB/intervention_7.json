Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they're justified in telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family and not giving him a position in the business.\n\nFirst, the author runs a family business with their siblings. The other person, who's been informally adopted, wants a more significant role. The author gave him a part-time job but he's been problematic\u2014alcoholism, getting into trouble, not being reliable. The author feels he's not qualified and doesn't want him in a management role. When the adoptee pushes back, the author tells him he's not family, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe adoptee was taken in as a child when the family couldn't leave him with his mother, who had drug issues. The author tried to mentor him but he hasn't succeeded. The adoptee uses the father's last name, which upsets the author. When the author refuses the promotion, the adoptee gets angry and causes damage.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key factors are fairness, family dynamics, and business decisions. The author is making a business decision based on qualifications and reliability. They mention that their siblings have roles because they're trusted. The adoptee hasn't proven himself competent, given his history of legal issues and alcoholism. The author's refusal is based on merit, not just family ties, even though they mention blood relations as a reason. However, the adoptee is considered family, albeit unofficially. The way the author told him he's not part of the family might be harsh, but the business decision might be justified. The adoptee's reaction is extreme, but the author's stance seems to be about business needs and trust. The author might have handled it differently (like explaining more), but the core decision isn't clearly wrong. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
