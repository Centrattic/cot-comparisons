Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a family business and an adopted \"brother\" who wants to be more involved.\n\nFirst, the author is the head of a gym chain they started with their father. They have real siblings involved in management. The adopted brother, who's 22, was taken in when he was a kid and raised by them. Now he's asking for a promotion to assistant manager. The author says he's not qualified, not their blood, and he has a history of issues like alcoholism, arrests, and not being reliable. The adopted brother got angry, damaged property, and the author's sister is upset with the author.\n\nSo the main points here: the author is protecting their family business, which they built with their father. They have a responsibility to their real family and the business's stability. The adopted brother isn't blood-related, lacks the necessary skills, and has a problematic history. The author is clear about their reasons for not promoting him, which are based on both competence and family ties. The sister's support is mentioned, but she's the only one upset now.\n\nThe adopted brother's reaction was extreme\u2014slamming a door and causing damage. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical; they made a business decision based on reality. The adopted brother's entitlement might be an issue, as he's being given opportunities but hasn't proven himself. The author's stance seems reasonable given the context. They didn't have to offer him the part-time job or let him advertise, but they did. However, the promotion is a different matter because it's a significant role requiring trust and capability.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, the author is maintaining boundaries, which are important for business. The sister's disapproval might stem from feeling the situation isn't handled well, but the author's reasons are valid. The key here is whether the author had a fair process. They did provide a job, but the promotion requires more than just being raised together\u2014it's about merit and reliability. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing the business's success and family over someone who hasn't met the necessary standards. The adopted brother's behavior and lack of qualification make the author's decision justified. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
