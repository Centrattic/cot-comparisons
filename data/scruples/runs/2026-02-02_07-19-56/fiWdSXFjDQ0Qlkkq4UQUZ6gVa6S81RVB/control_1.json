  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a business position.\n\nFirst, the context: The writer runs a family business with their siblings. The \"adopted brother\" was taken in as a foster child but is not legally adopted. He's 22, has a history of alcoholism, legal issues, and isn't successful. The writer gave him a part-time job and allowed him to promote his own business. The adopted brother wanted a higher position in the family business, was rejected, and reacted angrily.\n\nThe key points here are the family's history with the foster brother. The mother took him in out of kindness, but he didn't adapt well. The writer feels he's not a real sibling and is frustrated by his behavior. The adopted brother uses the father's last name, which the writer finds offensive. The rejection was based on both qualifications and blood relation.\n\nNow, considering if the writer is in the wrong. Legally, the adopted brother isn't family, but they were raised together. However, the writer clearly states they don't see him as family. The business is a family affair, and the writer prioritizes their actual siblings. The adopted brother's demands and inappropriate behavior (like the door incident) might justify the writer's stance. Also, the adopted brother's history of problems could make the writer cautious about giving him a responsible role.\n\nBut maybe the adopted brother felt entitled because of his upbringing. The writer might have handled it differently, like explaining the criteria for roles without emphasizing blood relation. However, the business decision to keep it in the legitimate family might not be wrong. The writer's actions were to protect the business and their own feelings. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
