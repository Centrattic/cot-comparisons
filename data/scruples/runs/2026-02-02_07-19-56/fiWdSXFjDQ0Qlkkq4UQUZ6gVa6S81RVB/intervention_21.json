Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics and business decisions.\n\nFirst, the author runs a gym chain with their siblings. They have an adopted \"brother,\" Jack, who's been part of their family since he was a kid. Jack now wants a promotion to assistant manager. The author says no, citing lack of qualifications and that Jack isn't blood-related. Jack reacts angrily, breaking a door, and the sister thinks the author was too harsh.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that Jack is not legally adopted but is introduced as a brother. They've given him a part-time job and let him use their father's last name. The author feels Jack is unqualified and has a history of issues: alcoholism, arrests, and not contributing to success. The sister is on Jack's side now, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's reasoning for rejecting Jack is based on two factors: qualifications and blood relation. Is it fair to base business roles on blood relation? Family businesses often prioritize family, but that can lead to conflicts. The author's stance might be seen as necessary for business success, especially if Jack's track record shows problems. However, treating family members differently can cause resentment.\n\nJack's behavior\u2014slamming the door, continuing to use the last name despite being asked\u2014shows he's not respecting boundaries. The author's response might be justified if they need to maintain business integrity. But maybe there's a middle ground, like mentorship or a different role. However, the author states Jack lacks the desire to succeed, which could make the assistant manager role unsuitable.\n\nThe sister's reaction is important too. If the author shared their feelings before, but the sister now sides with Jack, there might be communication issues. The author might need to explain their decision more clearly, but the core issue is whether excluding someone from family business roles based on blood relation is fair.\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to give Jack a position. Ethically, it's more complex. The author's business is family-run, and they have the right to manage it as they see fit. Jack's entitlement to a position isn't valid if he's unqualified. The author's decision isn't about family status but about qualifications and business needs. So, the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice. The answer is B.\n"
