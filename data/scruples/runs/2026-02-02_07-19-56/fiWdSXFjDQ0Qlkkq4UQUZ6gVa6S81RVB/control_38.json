Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for telling their adopted \"brother\" he isn't part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their family. They have biological siblings and a brother-in-law in management roles. The adopted brother, who was taken in as a foster child, has a troubled past with addiction, legal issues, and a poor work ethic. The author gave him a part-time job and allowed him to promote his own business at the gyms. The foster brother recently asked for an assistant manager role, was denied, and reacted angrily. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he isn't qualified and isn't blood-related. The foster brother was introduced as family but uses the last name, which the author finds offensive. The sister is upset with the author, thinking they went too far.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author has a right to protect their business and family. They've provided support despite the brother's issues, but now they're setting boundaries. The foster brother's demands and behavior (like slamming the door) suggest he's not meeting expectations. The author isn't obligated to give him a management role, especially with his history. However, the way the author expressed it (\"you're not part of the family\") might have been harsh, but the sister's reaction could be due to her different perspective. \n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility to their business, the foster brother's inappropriate demands, and the history of problematic behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their family and business over a non-relational figure who hasn't proven himself. The answer should be B.\n"
