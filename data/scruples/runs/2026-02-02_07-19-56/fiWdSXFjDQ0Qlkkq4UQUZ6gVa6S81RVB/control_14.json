Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the original poster is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a family business where the OP runs gyms with their siblings. They have an adopted \"brother\" who's been raised by their family but isn't legally adopted. This guy is 22 now and wants a job in the business, specifically an assistant manager role. The OP says he's not qualified and refuses, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The adopted brother was taken in when he was a child because his mother had issues. The OP tried to be a mentor but found the guy difficult. The brother has a history of arrests (theft, DUI) and is a recovering alcoholic. He's been given a part-time receptionist job and allowed to promote his personal trainer business. But now he wants more responsibility. The OP tells him he's not qualified and not family, which upsets him, causing a scene.\n\nLegally, the brother isn't adopted, so maybe there's no legal obligation for the OP to give him any position. However, the family has raised him and introduced him as a brother, which might create expectations. The brother using the OP's father's last name is a sore point for the OP, indicating a strained relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the OP was wrong to reject him. The OP has every right to hire based on qualifications, especially in a family business where trust is key. The brother's criminal history and lack of reliability (being a recovering addict, past arrests) could make the OP hesitant. The OP also mentions that the brother doesn't have the family's drive for success, which is important for the business.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel entitled because he's been part of the family for so long. The fact that the sister supports him could add to the tension. But the OP's stance is that he's not family by blood, and the brother isn't qualified. The OP's job is to protect the business, and hiring someone with a history of issues could be risky. The brother's reaction (damaging property) suggests he's not handling the rejection well, which might reflect on his suitability for a management role.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a point. She might feel the OP was harsh, but the OP's reasoning seems based on practical concerns. The brother's demand for a position without the necessary skills or experience could be seen as unfair. The OP did give him a part-time job, which is a step, but perhaps not what the brother wanted.\n\nIn family businesses, trust and reliability are crucial. The OP's decision to not promote him seems justified given his background. The brother might need to work his way up or gain more experience. The core issue is whether the OP is being fair in his assessment. Since the brother isn't blood-related and hasn't met the qualifications, the OP isn't necessarily in the wrong. The brother's entitlement might stem from being raised in the family, but the OP isn't obligated to provide a position he's not qualified for. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
