Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's adopted \"brother\" who wants a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the post. The author runs a family business with their real siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother, who wasn't legally adopted but raised by the family, is asking for a managerial role. The author denied him, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The adopted brother got angry and caused damage.\n\nThe author mentions that the adopted brother has a history of problematic behavior: being an unruly child, recovering alcoholic, has been arrested, and doesn't take responsibility. The author feels he's not a real sibling and is an annoyance. They also mention that the brother uses their father's last name despite being asked to stop.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, the adopted brother isn't legally part of the family, so the author isn't obligated to give him a position. However, ethically, it's a different ball game. The mother took in the boy out of kindness, and the family raised him. Even if he wasn't legally adopted, there's a moral obligation that might come into play here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on two points: lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. While the first is valid in a business context, the second seems like a personal bias. Businesses often hire based on merit, but family businesses have their own dynamics. However, excluding someone solely based on not being blood-related could be seen as discriminatory, even if it's a family business.\n\nThe adopted brother's behavior raises concerns about his reliability and responsibility. The author has tried to mentor him but to no avail. The brother's actions (slamming doors, not respecting the author's boundaries) suggest immaturity and a lack of respect. But the author's response of denying the position because of blood relation could hurt the brother's feelings and contribute to the conflict.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also a point to consider. If the author has shared these feelings before and the sister now thinks the author went too far, maybe there's a disconnect in how the family perceives the situation. The sister might see the adopted brother as part of the family regardless of his flaws.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might be right to prioritize qualified family members, but the way they dismissed the brother's request could come off as harsh. The brother was given a part-time role and allowed to advertise his business, which shows some support. However, the author's refusal to consider him for a higher position without a clear path to advancement could be seen as unfair, especially if the brother had expectations based on being raised in the family.\n\nThe use of the father's last name is a sensitive issue. The author's discomfort is understandable, but the brother using it despite being told not to shows a lack of respect, which the author is justified in addressing.\n\nOverall, the author's decision might be justified from a business perspective, but the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. The key is whether the author considered all factors, like the brother's potential for growth or alternative roles. However, given the brother's history and the author's clear boundaries, the author might not be in the wrong. But there's a chance that the author could be seen as dismissive and not providing enough support or opportunity for the brother to prove himself, despite his flaws.\n"
