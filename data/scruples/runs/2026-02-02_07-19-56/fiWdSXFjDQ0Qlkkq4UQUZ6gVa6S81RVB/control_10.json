Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author runs a family business with their real siblings and brother-in-law. They have an adopted \"brother\" who was taken in as a foster child but isn't legally adopted. The adopted brother wants a position in the business, specifically assistant manager. The author gave him a part-time receptionist job and allowed him to advertise his own personal trainer business. \n\nThe adopted brother has a history of issues: he's a recovering alcoholic, had run-ins with the law (theft, DUI), and the author feels he lacks the drive and ability to succeed. The author denies him the promotion, citing lack of qualification and not being blood-related. The adopted brother reacts angrily, causing damage and making the sister think the author went too far.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the adopted brother isn't legally part of the family, the author's business is a family-run operation, and the adopted brother's behavior and history raise concerns about his suitability for a responsible position. The author also mentions that the adopted brother uses the deceased father's last name, which upsets them.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to choose who they trust with business responsibilities. Family businesses often prioritize blood relatives for roles requiring trust and stability. The adopted brother's history of failures and legal issues could justify the author's decision. Also, the author tried to mentor him but found it unsuccessful.\n\nOn the other hand, the foster brother was raised by the family, though not legally adopted. The mother took him in out of kindness, and the author tried to be a mentor. The adopted brother might feel entitled, especially given the family's role in his upbringing. However, the author isn't obligated to provide him with a position in the business, especially when his track record is problematic. The author's refusal is based on both merit and family ties, which are valid considerations in a family business.\n\nThe sister's reaction might be influenced by the foster brother's emotional state, but the author isn't wrong for prioritizing the business's stability over family obligations that aren't legally binding. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B). They made a business decision based on the individual's qualifications and family dynamics, which are relevant in a family-run company.\n"
