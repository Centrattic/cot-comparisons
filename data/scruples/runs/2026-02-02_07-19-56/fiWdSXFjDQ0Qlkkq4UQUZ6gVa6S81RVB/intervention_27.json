Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" that he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the author runs a family business with their blood siblings and brother-in-law. The adopted brother, now 22, was taken in due to their mother's religious nature. He's been difficult, with a history of alcoholism, legal issues, and the author finds him unqualified. The author gave him part-time work but denied a promotion to assistant manager, citing lack of qualification and not being blood.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship, the business decisions, and the communication. The adopted brother isn't legally part of the family, but they are introduced as such. The author's reasons for not promoting him are based on qualifications and family ties. However, the author's harsh response (\"not part of our family\") and the brother's reaction (slamming the door, using the father's last name) add tension.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, promoting based on qualifications makes sense. But the author's personal feelings and the way they communicated the denial might be problematic. Using \"not my blood\" could be seen as discriminatory or hurtful, especially since the brother was raised in the family. The author also mentions their mother's influence in taking him in, so cutting ties might conflict with that.\n\nHowever, the brother's behavior and lack of suitability for the role are valid concerns. The author has to consider the business's success and trust, which family ties can provide. The brother's entitlement and disrespect (using the last name, pushing for roles) might justify the author's stance.\n\nBut the way the author expressed it could be unkind. The brother might feel betrayed, especially if he was raised as family. The author's admission of seeing him as an \"annoyance\" suggests unresolved issues. The sister's reaction indicates that the approach might have been too harsh.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author did give him a chance but it's reasonable to set boundaries based on performance. However, the method of denying the promotion and the harsh words could be seen as the author's fault for not handling it more sensitively. The brother's reaction (slamming the door) is his own responsibility, but the author's approach might have escalated the conflict unnecessarily.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision might be justified in terms of business needs, but the way they communicated it is where they could be in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes) because the author's personal feelings and harsh response contributed to the conflict, but if the focus is on business decisions, maybe B (No). However, the user thought the author is in the wrong, so I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
