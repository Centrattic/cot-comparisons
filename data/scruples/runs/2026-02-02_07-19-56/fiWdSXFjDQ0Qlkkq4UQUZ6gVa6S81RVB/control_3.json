Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family when he asked for a job in the business. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author runs a family business with their blood siblings and brother-in-law. They gave the adopted brother a part-time job and allowed him to promote his own business. But the adopted brother has a history of issues: alcoholism, jail for theft and DUI, and a lack of responsibility. The author feels he's not qualified and not family, hence not eligible for the assistant manager role. The brother reacted angrily, breaking a door.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author was wrong. The key points are: the author's reasons for not promoting him (not qualified and not blood-related), the brother's behavior issues, and the fact that the brother was never legally adopted. The family introduced him as a brother for his feelings, but the author doesn't see him that way.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, businesses often prioritize family for roles, especially when it's a family business. However, the author might be seen as being biased if the adopted brother was being considered for a role he's qualified for. But in this case, the author says he's not qualified. The brother's history of problems, including legal issues and alcoholism, supports the author's decision. The author also had to ask him to stop using their father's last name, which he ignored, showing disrespect.\n\nThe sister's reaction is mixed; she shares the author's feelings but now thinks he went too far. However, the author's stance on the business being a family affair is common. The brother's entitlement to the position might be questionable given his background. The physical outburst by the brother also indicates his problematic behavior.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision seems justified. They provided a part-time job despite the brother's issues, but higher responsibility roles require more than just family ties. The author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
