Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their siblings and brother-in-law. The \"brother\" in question wasn't legally adopted but was taken in by their mother as a foster child. The family raised him, introduced him as family, but the author doesn't see him that way. The guy is 22, has issues like alcoholism, legal problems, and now wants a higher position. The author refused, saying he's not qualified and not blood-related. He got upset and broke a door.\n\nThe key points here are: the foster brother was raised by the family, but the author feels he's not a real sibling. The business is kept in the family, which is common but can be controversial. The author's refusal might be based on both capability and family ties. The foster brother's reaction was aggressive, but the author's stance is about qualifications and family loyalty.\n\nLegally, the foster brother isn't part of the family, but emotionally, the family has a history. However, the author's business decisions prioritize blood family, which is their right. The foster brother's behavior (theft, DUI) and lack of qualifications justify the refusal. The author isn't being discriminatory if they're not offering the job to non-family members either. However, there's a possible hypocrisy if others in the business aren't as qualified but are given roles because of blood ties. But given the context, the author's reasons seem valid. The foster brother's entitlement might be the real issue here. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
