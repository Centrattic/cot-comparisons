Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, the context: The AITA runs a gym chain with their father, who passed away. They have biological siblings in management roles and a brother-in-law. The adopted brother, now 22, was taken in when he was a child because his drug-addicted mother couldn't care for him. The AITA tried to mentor him but found him difficult\u2014unruly, a recovering alcoholic, with a history of legal issues. They gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his personal trainer business. The adopted brother recently asked for an assistant manager role, which the AITA denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. The adopted brother reacted angrily, damaging property, and the sister now thinks the AITA was too harsh.\n\nSo, is the AITA in the wrong? Let's consider the points. The adopted brother was not legally adopted but was raised by the family, introduced as family. However, the AITA clearly feels he's not a sibling but an \"annoyance.\" The business is family-run, and they prefer keeping it in the family. The adopted brother's actions (legal issues, alcoholism, unprofessional behavior) might justify the AITA's refusal. However, the way it was handled\u2014telling him he's not family\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially since the family introduced him as such. The AITA might be prioritizing business needs over emotional ties, but the adopted brother's feelings and the sister's reaction suggest there's more complexity. The AITA might not be in the wrong for business decisions but could have handled the communication better. However, the core issue is whether excluding him from the business because he's not blood family is fair. Since family businesses often prioritize blood relatives, maybe the AITA isn't wrong. But the way it was said might be. But the question is if the AITA is in the wrong for the action, not the communication style. The denial of the position based on qualifications and blood relation seems justified given the brother's history. So, the answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance. However, the sister's reaction and the brother's upbringing complicate it. Still, the AITA's right to manage their business as they see fit, especially with the brother's track record, might mean they're not in the wrong.\n"
