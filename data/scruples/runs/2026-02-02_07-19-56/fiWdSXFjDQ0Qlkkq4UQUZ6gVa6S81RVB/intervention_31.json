Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author runs a family business and has an adopted \"brother\" who's now 22. The adopted brother wants a job in the business, but the author feels he's not qualified and isn't family, so he denied him. The adopted brother got upset, slammed a door, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They've given the adopted brother a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his business. They've tried to mentor him but he's problematic\u2014alcohol issues, legal problems, not meeting expectations. The author values keeping the business within blood family members and trusts them. They feel the adopted brother doesn't share the family's work ethic and has a history of poor decisions. The adopted brother uses the family last name, which the author finds offensive, and when denied a promotion, he reacted aggressively.\n\nOn the other hand, the adopted brother was taken in by the family since he was a child, even though not legally adopted. The mother's intention was to foster him until his parent could take him back, but that didn't happen. The family has raised him, provided for him, and introduced him as family. The adopted brother might feel entitled to the same opportunities as the real siblings, even if he's not legally family. The author's refusal based on blood relation could be seen as unfair, especially if the adopted brother considers himself part of the family. The author's harsh words (\"you're not my blood\") could have been hurtful, and the situation escalated when the adopted brother reacted emotionally.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a business standpoint, the author has the right to choose who to hire based on qualifications and family dynamics. However, the author's treatment of the adopted brother might be contributing to the conflict. The adopted brother's behavior (slamming the door, using the last name) is problematic, but the author's response of denying him a position due to not being blood might not be the most constructive approach. The sister's disagreement suggests there's family tension here.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's decision to deny the position based on not being blood, even though the adopted brother was raised as family, and the way it was communicated. The author's reasons are valid in terms of business management and trust, but the method of delivering the message could be seen as dismissive. The adopted brother's actions (using the last name, past issues) are also concerning. However, the author might have handled the situation better by focusing on qualifications and behavior rather than blood relation, which could be perceived as discriminatory or hurtful. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could have been more tactful. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) but with some nuance.\n"
