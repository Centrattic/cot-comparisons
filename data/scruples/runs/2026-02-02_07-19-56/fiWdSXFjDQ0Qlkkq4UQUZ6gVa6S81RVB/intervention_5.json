Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a family business run by the author, with their siblings and brother-in-law involved. There's an adopted \"brother\" who's 22 now, but not legally adopted. The family took him in as a foster kid, but he's had a lot of issues\u2014alcoholism, legal problems, and isn't successful. The author gave him a part-time job and let him advertise his own failing business. Then the foster brother asked for a promotion to assistant manager, which the author denied, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood family. The foster brother got angry, broke a door in the gym, and the sister is upset with the author.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that the job is for family, specifically blood family. But the foster brother was part of the family in a practical sense, even if not legally. The mother took him in, and they introduced him as family. The author's mom even gave him their last name, which the author finds offensive. The author helped raise him, but the foster brother didn't reciprocate the effort, leading to frustration.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The foster brother was part of the family environment, even if not legally. 2) The author's business is kept within the family, but does that include non-blood relatives who were raised as family? 3) The foster brother's request for a position based on his perceived status as family. 4) The author's response of \"you're not my blood\" might be perceived as discriminatory or dismissive.\n\nThe author might argue that they're protecting the business and ensuring it's managed well. They have valid concerns about the foster brother's track record and qualifications. However, the foster brother might feel entitled to the same opportunities as the siblings because he was raised as family. The sister's reaction suggests that maybe the author's response was harsh, especially if the foster brother felt he was being treated unfairly.\n\nAnother angle is the foster brother's behavior. He's had legal issues and struggles with alcoholism, which could make the author hesitant to trust him with a managerial role. But the author's dismissal based on not being blood family could be seen as unfair, especially since the foster brother was part of the family for a long time. The author might need to consider the emotional aspect and how their refusal came off, even if the decision itself is justified by the foster brother's capabilities.\n\nThe sister's support for the author in the past but now feeling they went too far indicates that the method of communication or the reason given might be an issue. Saying \"you're not my blood\" is a blunt way to deny someone a job, even if the author believes it's the right decision. The foster brother's anger and the broken door are his faults, but the author's approach might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for protecting the business and making decisions based on merit and capability. However, the way they communicated the decision could be problematic. The foster brother's sense of family might not align with the author's, but the author's refusal to consider him despite his family status (even if not blood) could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have a valid reason, but the manner in which they expressed it might be where they're in the wrong.\n"
