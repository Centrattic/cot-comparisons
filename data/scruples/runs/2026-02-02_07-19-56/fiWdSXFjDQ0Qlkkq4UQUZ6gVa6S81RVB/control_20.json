Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an adopted \"brother\" who's been taken care of by the family since he was a kid, now he's asking for a job in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has a business with their siblings and brother-in-law. They've given the adopted brother a part-time job and allowed him to advertise his own business there. But he's had issues with alcohol, been in jail for theft and DUI, and doesn't seem to take responsibility. The author refuses a promotion because he's not qualified and not family. The adopted brother got angry, damaged property, and the sister is upset with the author now.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for not giving him the position. They mention he's not qualified and not blood-related. The family business is kept within the family for trust and reliability. The adopted brother, while raised by them, wasn't legally adopted and uses the father's last name without permission. The author also helped raise him despite his problematic behavior.\n\nI need to consider if the author is justified in their decision. Since the business is family-run, it's common to prioritize relatives, especially when trust is important. The adopted brother's history of legal issues and the author's concern about qualifications seem valid. However, the way the author might have handled the rejection could be a problem. The sister thinks the author went too far, maybe because the adopted brother feels entitled despite the circumstances. The author's refusal based on not being blood-related might be seen as harsh, but given the brother's behavior and the business needs, it could be justified.\n\nAlso, the adopted brother's actions (slamming the door) show a lack of professional conduct, which could validate the author's decision. The sister's reaction might be because she still sees him as family, but the author has valid concerns about the business's success and the brother's reliability.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting the business and prioritizing qualified family members, given the brother's history. The answer is B.\n"
