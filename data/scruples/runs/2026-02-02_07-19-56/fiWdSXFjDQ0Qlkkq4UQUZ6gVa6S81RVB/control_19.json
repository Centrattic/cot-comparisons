  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA For telling my adopted \"brother\" that hes not part of our family, after he demanded a position in the family business?\nI run a medium sized chain of local gyms that I started with my father in 2002. Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics, a business, and an adopted \"brother\" who's causing conflict.\n\nFirst, the author runs a family business with siblings. They have a non-blood brother, raised by their mother, who's now asking for a promotion to assistant manager. The author says no because he's not qualified and not blood-related. The adopted brother gets angry, causing damage.\n\nThe author's reasoning: They value family trust in business. The adopted brother has a history of issues\u2014alcoholism, legal troubles, and poor work performance. The author feels he's not part of the family anymore and isn't qualified. The brother uses the father's last name despite being asked to stop.\n\nThe sister is upset, thinking the author went too far. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: Is it fair to exclude someone based on blood relation in a family business? Did the author overstep by rejecting the brother's request, especially since they were raised together? On the other hand, business decisions need competence. The brother's behavior and track record might disqualify him regardless of family ties.\n\nLegal adoption isn't the case here, but they introduced him as family. The author's resentment towards the brother's presence and past actions adds complexity. The brother's entitlement might be an issue.\n\nThe key points are: The author prioritized blood relation and qualifications, which is common in family businesses. The brother's actions and history make him unsuitable. The author's rejection was based on merit and business needs, not just blood. However, the way it was handled\u2014being blunt and causing a scene\u2014might be seen as harsh. But the core issue is the decision itself.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the decision is about business integrity and the brother's lack of qualifications. The answer is B.\n"
