Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, the author runs a family business and has siblings who are involved. The adopted brother was taken in by their mother, but he's had issues with behavior, alcohol, and legal problems. The author gave him a part-time role but now he's asking for a higher position. The author refused, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood-related. The adopted brother reacted angrily, broke a glass door, and the sister thinks the author went too far.\n\nSo, the question is about fairness here. The author's reasoning is that family business roles are reserved for blood relatives because trust is important. They also mention the adopted brother's problematic history. But others might argue that since they were raised as family, he should be considered part of the family. However, the key points are that he's not legally adopted, he's been uncooperative, and the author's family has made it clear he's not considered a sibling. The author's stance seems to be about both merit and family trust. The brother's reaction suggests he might have felt entitled, which the author had to address. The sister's reaction is mixed, but the author's actions seem justified given the brother's history and the nature of family businesses. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
