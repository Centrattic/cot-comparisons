Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family after he demanded a position in the family business.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their real siblings and brother-in-law. The \"adopted brother\" was taken in by their mom when he was a kid but has issues like being an alcoholic, has been in jail, and is unqualified. The author gave him a part-time job but now he's asking for a management position. The author said no, citing lack of qualifications and not being blood relatives. The adopted brother got angry and caused damage.\n\nSo, the key points here are family dynamics, business decisions, and the treatment of the adopted brother. The author is maintaining boundaries, which is important in business, especially when family is involved. The adopted brother was raised in the family but isn't legally part of it. The author is clear that business roles are for blood family members, which is a common practice to avoid conflicts.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the author treated the adopted brother. They gave him a part-time job, which was a chance to integrate him into the business. However, when he asked for more responsibility, the author refused. The brother's reaction was extreme, but the author's refusal might be justified given his history and lack of qualifications.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The answer depends on whether the author overstepped by explicitly stating that the brother isn't family. The author might argue that they're being honest about their business practices. The brother might feel disrespected, but the author isn't legally bound to treat him as family. The author also mentions that the brother uses their father's last name, which is a point of contention.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author is setting clear boundaries for their business. While the adopted brother might feel hurt, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing business integrity and family ties. The brother's behavior and history also play a role here. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
