Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics and a business decision. The author runs a gym chain and has a step-brother, adopted in name but not legally. This step-brother is asking for a management position, but the author refuses because he's not qualified and not blood-related. The step-brother then gets angry and causes damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author emphasizes that they want to keep the business in the family, which is their right. The step-brother was given a part-time job before, but now he's pushing for a more responsible role. The author has valid reasons: lack of qualifications and his problematic behavior (like alcoholism and legal issues). The step-brother's reaction\u2014damaging property\u2014shows poor emotional control.\n\nThe author's sister is upset, but maybe she doesn't see the full extent of the step-brother's issues. The step-brother isn't legally part of the family, which complicates things. The author's stance is about competence and trust. They have real siblings in management roles, which is fair if those siblings are qualified. The step-brother's outburst might indicate deeper issues, but the author isn't obligated to give him a position he's not suited for.\n\nAlso, the step-brother using the father's last name despite being asked not to is a sign of disrespect. The author's refusal seems justified based on his actions. The main question is whether the refusal was unfair. The author provided clear reasons: not qualified and not family. Since the business is family-run, prioritizing blood relatives (if they're qualified) is common. However, the author might need to address the step-brother's behavior issues separately, but the job position itself was a decision based on merit and family preference.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they made a business decision based on qualifications and family preferences. The step-brother's reaction is his own problem, and the author isn't obligated to reward his behavior.\n"
