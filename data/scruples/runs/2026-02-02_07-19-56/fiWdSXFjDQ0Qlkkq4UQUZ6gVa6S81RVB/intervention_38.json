Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author, who runs a family business with their siblings, rejecting an adopted brother's request for a management position. The adopted brother isn't blood-related but was raised by the family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has clear reasons: the brother isn't qualified, lacks responsibility, has a criminal record, and the author doesn't see him as family. The brother was fostered but not legally adopted, uses the family name, and has a history of issues.\n\nThe author's stance is about trust and keeping the business in the family. Legally, they don't have to offer him a position. However, the brother might feel entitled due to being raised as family. The author's response was direct, maybe harsh, like telling him he's not family. The sister is now upset, which complicates things.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the business is their own, and they can choose employees based on qualifications. The brother's behavior and past issues are valid concerns. But the way the author communicated it might come off as dismissive, especially if the brother felt supported by the family. The author's sister's reaction suggests there's tension here. However, the author is within their rights to prioritize business needs and family trust. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
