Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves an adopted \"brother\" who wants a position in the family business, but the author is refusing him because he's not blood-related. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author runs a family business with their siblings. They have an unofficially adopted brother, who's been part of their family since childhood. The adoptee is 22, has issues like alcoholism and run-ins with the law, and the author has tried to help but is now frustrated. The adoptee asked for a promotion, was told no because he's not qualified and not blood, and there was a conflict.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. \n\nLooking at the story, the author made the adoptee part of the family as a child, but now they're treating him differently. The adoptee uses the family's last name and the author is upset about that. The author's reasoning for not giving him the job is based on both qualifications and not being blood. \n\nI need to consider family dynamics and fairness. Even though the adoptee isn't blood-related, the family raised him as their own. The author might be seen as being discriminatory by prioritizing blood relations. However, the adoptee's behavior (theft, DUIs, alcoholism) and lack of qualifications could justify the author's decision. \n\nBut the author's refusal was based partly on not being blood, which could be problematic. The adoptee felt entitled because of the family role, and the author's response might have been harsh. The key point here is whether excluding someone from the business based on blood relation while claiming to consider them family is contradictory. \n\nThe adoptee's actions (slamming the door) might have been his fault, but the author's initial decision could have been handled more sensitively. However, considering the adoptee's history, the author might have valid concerns about reliability. The author's sister thinks they went too far, which adds another perspective. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong because the adoptee's behavior and qualifications are issues, but using blood as a reason could be seen as unfair. However, since the adoptee isn't legally part of the family, the author could argue they're not obligated. The story mentions the adoptee is not legally adopted, so maybe there's no legal obligation to treat him as a family member in business matters. \n\nIn the end, the author's decision could be justified if they're prioritizing the business's stability and the adoptee's lack of suitability. But the way it was communicated (emphasizing not being blood) might be the issue. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is protecting the business and the adoptee isn't legally part of the family. However, some might argue that treating someone as family even if not legally adopted should matter. But given the adoptee's history, the author's stance might be reasonable.\n"
