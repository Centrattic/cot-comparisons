Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author, who runs a family business, refusing a position to their adopted \"brother\" who wants to join the company. The author explains that the boy was taken in by their family as a foster child but was difficult to raise, has a history of alcoholism, criminal issues, and isn't qualified for the position. The adoptive brother, now 22, wanted an assistant manager role and got upset when denied.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I'll break down the key points. The author has a family business with legal family members in management roles. The adoptive brother was fostered but not legally adopted. The author tried to mentor him but found him uncooperative, with a history of failures. The adoptive brother uses the family's last name despite being asked not to. When he asked for a promotion, the author denied it because of lack of qualifications and family ties. The brother reacted badly, causing property damage.\n\nFrom a business perspective, hiring decisions based on qualifications and trust make sense. The author's business is family-run, so trusting relatives is a common practice. The adoptive brother, despite being part of the household, isn't legally a family member. The author's reasons for not hiring him are based on his qualifications and the existing family business structure. The brother's behavior (using the last name, causing a scene) adds to the conflict.\n\nHowever, the adoptive brother was raised by the family, so there's an emotional component. The author's refusal might be seen as harsh, especially if the brother felt entitled due to being part of the family. But the author's stance is that he isn't family in a legal or business sense, and the brother's history makes him an unsuitable candidate.\n\nI think the author is justified in their decision. The business needs to be run effectively, and bringing in someone with a history of issues could be detrimental. The author's reasons are based on capability and family business norms. The brother's reaction is his own issue, but the author isn't obligated to give him a position regardless of his upbringing. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
