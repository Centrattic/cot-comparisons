Dad passed away four years ago. I have a younger blood brother and a younger blood sister who each have management like roles in my business. My brother in law is also involved.\n\nI like keeping things in the family, i can trust them and though things have been hard we make it through together.\n\nHowever, I also have another, unofficially adopted \"brother\" that is now 22 and wants to be involved in my business. I gave him a part time position as a receptionist, in addition to allowing him to advertise his failing personal trainer business at my gyms.\n\nThe story is my mother was very religious, and giving. She would cry over a fly getting swatted. She had a best friend who had drug problems, with a four year old who she couldnt support. The plan was that my family would foster him until she got back on her feet. She ditched him and left him with us and we've taken care of him ever since.\n\nHe was an unruly, rude little shit who I helped raise. I tried my best over the years to be an older brother / mentor to him like my mother asked but i cant. He refuses to learn and adapt, and he lacks my families desire to try to be successful.\n\nHes a recovering alcoholic with all the advantages of the world, he continues to fuck up things that are simple and straightforward. Ive bailed him out of jail for theft at least once, my sister has also bailed him once for DUI. \n\nI dont see him as a sibling. I see him as an annoyance that cant get out of my life fast enough. He serves no use to me or the business.\n\nHe is not legally adopted but we introduce him as that to soothe his feelings. He uses my fathers last name in casual conversation and it makes me physically ill. Ive asked him to stop using it but he does so anyway.\n\nHes recently asked for the role of assistant manager, a position that has actual responsibility. I told him no. He pushed me by asking why he doesnt get the positions my real siblings have. I told him that a) Youre not qualified and b) Youre not my blood.\n\nHe flipped out and slammed our buildings glass door causing a crack. Told my sister and she thinks ive gone too far despite sharing my feelings in the past. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their adopted \"brother\" he's not part of the family when he asked for a position in the business. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author runs a gym chain with their father, now deceased. They have blood siblings and a brother-in-law involved. The adopted brother, who's 22, was taken in when he was a kid by the mother who was religious and giving. The author tried to mentor him but he's been problematic: unruly, an alcoholic, got into legal trouble, and even after being helped, he fails repeatedly. The author gave him a part-time receptionist job and let him promote his own PT business. Now the adopted brother wants a management role, but the author rejects him, saying he's not qualified and not blood. The brother flipped out, cracked the door, and the sister is upset with the author. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, let's break it down. The key points are the family dynamics, the brother's behavior, the position in the business, and the communication. The author is being honest about not considering him family, which the brother might not like, but given the brother's actions and the author's reasons, is that fair?\n\nFirst, the term \"adopted brother\" is a bit confusing. The author mentions it's not legal adoption. They refer to him as an adopted brother to \"soothe his feelings,\" which suggests the brother believes he is family. However, the author clearly states they don't see him as a sibling, just an annoyance. So, there's some inconsistency in how the brother is treated and introduced (using the father's last name despite the author's request otherwise). \n\nThe brother's behavior is a big factor. He's been in trouble for theft and DUI, is a recovering alcoholic, and has failed at simple tasks. The author has supported him financially, but he doesn't reciprocate the effort. The author's business is family-run, and they prefer keeping it in the family for trust and teamwork. The brother's demands for a management role might be seen as entitlement, especially since he wasn't qualified. \n\nThe author's response to \"you're not my blood\" might come off as harsh, but it's a business decision. However, saying he's not family could be hurtful. The brother's reaction of slamming the door and causing damage is problematic, but the question is whether the author was wrong in their response. \n\nThe sister is upset, which complicates things. Maybe she sees the brother as family still, but the author and others don't. The core issue is whether the author had the right to exclude him based on non-biological ties. The author's justification is based on trust, capability, and the brother's lack of contribution. \n\nIs the author wrong for being honest? The brother was given opportunities but failed to meet expectations. The author is running a business and needs reliable people. The brother's entitlement and lack of qualifications might make the author's decision reasonable. But the way it was communicated\u2014saying he's not family\u2014might be seen as cruel, especially if the brother genuinely believed he was part of the family. However, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially given the brother's past. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have handled it better by being more supportive or offering further training instead of outright rejection. But the brother's history of failure and the business's need for competence could justify the decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They had valid reasons for not promoting him, and the brother's behavior and lack of qualifications support that. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, the way it was communicated could be improved, but the core decision might be justified.\n"
