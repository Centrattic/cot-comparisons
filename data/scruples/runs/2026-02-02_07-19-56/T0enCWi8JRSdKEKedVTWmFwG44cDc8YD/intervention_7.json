Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the partner has a history of refusing to go out on weekends with excuses like being tired, not wanting to spend money (even though they can afford it), or not feeling like driving. The author decided to take the child to a farm with a friend, which costs \u00a37 each. The partner then gets upset because he's at work and wants to go another day. The author points out that previous attempts to go out were met with similar excuses and that this is a child-friendly activity, not a movie date.\n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibilities in parenting and communication. The partner feels left out when the author goes out with their friend, but the author has been trying to get the partner involved with the child's activities, which he's been avoiding. The activity in question is a petting zoo, which isn't a private or romantic event but something for the child. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to stem from feeling excluded or not prioritized, but the author's actions are about providing the child with an experience. The partner's previous excuses suggest he's not been supportive of these outings. The author isn't wrong for trying to give the child a fun activity, especially when the partner hasn't been cooperative. The fact that the author offered to go whenever the partner is available but he didn't take the opportunity shows that the author is open to shared time but the partner hasn't reciprocated. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't doing anything that the partner didn't agree to beforehand. The partner's current objection seems more about wanting to have control over the schedule rather than a genuine need for fairness. The cost is minimal, and the activity is appropriate for the child. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're fulfilling their role as a parent by providing experiences for their child, especially when the other parent isn't engaging. The partner's reaction is more about his own feelings of exclusion rather than a valid reason to cancel the plans.\n"
