Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the partner's excuses. The author mentions that almost every weekend, the partner gives excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. That seems like the partner isn't being cooperative in taking the child out. The author then agrees to go with a friend to a farm when the partner is at work. The partner gets upset because he wants to go but is at work. The author points out that they had asked before and were denied, so they took the initiative. The partner is now upset and wants to cancel, but the author says they can go another time.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in parenting and fairness. Both parents are responsible for childcare, but if one parent is consistently not engaging because of excuses, the other might take the initiative. The author isn't taking the kid for a selfish reason but for the child's benefit. The partner's reaction seems to be about feeling left out rather than the child's needs. The activity isn't a movie; it's a kids' petting zoo, so it's appropriate for the child. The author isn't doing anything that requires the partner's presence. The partner's refusal to participate before and then getting upset when the author takes action suggests the partner isn't pulling their weight. So, the author isn't wrong for taking the child out when the other parent isn't available or willing. Answer B.\n"
