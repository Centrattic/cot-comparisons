I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: The writer mentions that almost every weekend they suggest taking their child to a play center or a farm, but their partner consistently gives excuses. The partner doesn't want to go, says they're tired, or mentions not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The writer then decided to take the child to a farm with a friend the next day, but the partner got upset because he was at work and wanted to go. The writer pointed out that they had tried before and the partner didn't want to go, so they went without him. Now the partner wants them to cancel, but the writer says they can go whenever the partner wants.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about shared responsibilities in childcare and fairness. The partner feels left out because they can't go when they're working, and the writer is frustrated by the partner's previous excuses. The writer is trying to do something for the child's benefit, which is reasonable. The partner's reaction might be about feeling excluded or not being considered. \n\nBut the partner had previously refused to go out multiple times, so the writer isn't just ignoring the partner's input; they're acting on their own initiative when the partner is unavailable. The cost isn't an issue, so money isn't the problem. The activity is a children's petting zoo, which is family-friendly. The writer isn't going to a movie alone, which might be more of a personal activity. \n\nI think the key here is whether taking the child out without the partner is unfair. The partner might feel left out, but the writer is responding to consistent refusals. The writer is trying to provide an activity for the child, which is a valid reason. The partner's reaction seems to be more about wanting to have control or feel included, which is understandable, but the writer isn't being unreasonable by going when the partner is working. The writer also offered to go whenever the partner wants, which shows flexibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong. They're following through with plans when the partner wasn't available and had previously declined. The partner's reaction is about unmet expectations, but the writer isn't being selfish. The answer should be B.\n"
