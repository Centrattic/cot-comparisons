Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work, and the partner is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The parent has tried multiple times to go out with their child, but the partner has consistently given excuses. Now, when the parent finally decides to go out with a friend, the partner is upset because they feel it's unfair since they're working. The parent argues that the partner has previously refused to go out and now is being asked to cancel the plans.\n\nSo, the key points are: the partner has been resistant to going out, the parent is acting on their own to do something the child would enjoy, and the partner feels excluded or that it's unfair. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong by taking the child without the partner's presence.\n\nI think the partner's behavior might be contributing to the issue. If they've been consistently dismissive or resistant to spending time with the child on weekends, then the parent stepping in to provide that fun activity might be justified. The parent isn't doing anything harmful; they're ensuring the child has a good experience. The partner's reaction seems to stem from feeling left out or not being involved, but that's more about their own feelings rather than the parent's actions being wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe there's an expectation in the relationship that both parents should be present for such outings. If that's the case, then the parent might be in the wrong for not including the partner. But the parent mentioned that the partner has refused in the past, so taking the child alone could be seen as a reasonable compromise. \n\nI need to consider if there's a cultural or societal norm that expects both parents to be present for such activities. If that's the case, then the parent might be in the wrong. But if the parent is making an effort to spend time with the child when the other parent is unavailable or uninterested, it might be justified.\n\nAlso, the cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which isn't significant, so the partner's previous excuses about money might be invalid. The parent is using a friend to go, which could be a social support aspect. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're prioritizing the child's well-being and their own initiative when the other parent isn't cooperating. The partner's reaction is more about their own feelings rather than a valid reason to say the parent is in the wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
