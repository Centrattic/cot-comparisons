      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun place like a play center or farm on the weekend while their partner is at work. The partner consistently gives excuses, and this time the author went ahead and made plans with a friend, but the partner got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The partner works on weekends and is tired or doesn't want to spend money. The author tried to take the child out, but the partner refused before. Now, the author made independent plans, and the partner is upset. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nLooking at the details: the author is taking the child to a petting zoo, which is a family-friendly activity. The cost is \u00a37 each, which the author says isn't a problem. The partner is upset because he wants to go but is at work, and the author is taking the child without him. The author is arguing that they tried before and were told no, so this time they just went ahead.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual agreement are important. The partner might feel left out or that the author isn't considering his feelings. But the author is also trying to provide for the child's enjoyment when the partner isn't available. The partner's excuses (tired, cost) might be valid if they were genuine and discussed, but the author points out that money isn't an issue.\n\nThe partner's reaction of getting upset about the plans might be inconsiderate, especially if the author made the decision after previous refusals. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting in the child's best interest and the partner's own prior refusals could have justified going without him. However, the partner might feel it's unfair that the author didn't wait for him to be available. But since the author was already planning with a friend, and the partner's own excuses have been recurring, the author's action could be seen as reasonable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
