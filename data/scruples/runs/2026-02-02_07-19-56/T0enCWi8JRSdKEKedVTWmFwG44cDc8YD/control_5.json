Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their partner are both parents of a 3-year-old. The author wants to take the kid out to fun places like a play center or a farm on weekends, but every time they suggest it, the partner gives excuses like being tired, not wanting to go out, or not wanting to spend money. The author mentions that they have money, so money isn't really an issue. \n\nThis time, the author's friend invited them to a farm, which is a petting zoo, and the author agreed to go. When they told the partner, the partner got upset because he was at work and wanted to go instead. The author points out that in the past, when they tried to go out, the partner refused for other reasons. Now, the partner is upset about the author going without him. The author is confused because it's a kids' activity, not a movie date.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness in parental decision-making and whether the author is overstepping by making plans without the partner. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the partner has been consistently avoiding these outings with various excuses. The author is trying to provide fun activities for the child, which is a valid parenting goal. The partner is now upset that the author went ahead without him, even though he previously declined. The author is trying to balance their parent's preferences with their own and the child's needs.\n\nIn co-parenting, both parents should ideally be on the same page. But if one parent is consistently not participating, the other might need to make decisions independently to ensure the child's well-being. The partner's reaction seems inconsistent\u2014first not wanting to go, now getting upset about someone else going. The cost is minimal (\u00a37), so money isn't a real issue. The author isn't going for leisure but to take the child out, which is a responsible action. \n\nThe partner's demand to cancel the plans because he's at work seems like he's prioritizing his own convenience over the child's needs and the previous excuses. The author's friend is involved, but that might not be the main issue. The key is that the author is trying to fulfill their role as a parent, and the partner's resistance is creating conflict without valid reasons.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking initiative to give their child positive experiences, and the partner's behavior is inconsistent and self-centered. The answer should be B.\n"
