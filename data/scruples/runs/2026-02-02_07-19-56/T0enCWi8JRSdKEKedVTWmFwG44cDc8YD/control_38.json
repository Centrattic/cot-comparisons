Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that they often try to take their child out to places like play centers or farms on weekends, but the partner gives excuses each time. The excuses are about not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they have the money. \n\nThis time, the author arranged with a friend to go to a farm. The partner gets upset, saying it's unfair since he's at work and wants to go. The author points out that they tried to go not long ago and the partner said no due to cost and tiredness. The partner now wants to cancel the plans so he can go another day. The author refuses, arguing that it's a kids' petting zoo, not a movie.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are shared responsibility in parenting and fair division of time and effort. The partner seems to be avoiding taking the child out, giving repeated excuses. The author is stepping up to provide an experience for the child when the partner is unavailable. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to be about feeling left out or wanting to have control over the plans. However, the author's actions are about fulfilling the child's need for fun activities, especially since the parent is at work. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), and the activity is appropriate for a child. \n\nThe author isn't excluding the partner from the child's life; the partner was already not participating due to their own choices. The author is using their own initiative to ensure the child has a good time. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both parents should be involved in such activities. But since the partner has been consistently uncooperative, the author isn't wrong for taking initiative. The partner's current reaction might be about being upset that plans were made without them, but if they were making excuses before, they can't expect to take over now. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. The partner's excuses and last-minute objections are unreasonable. The author is doing what's best for the child given the partner's prior behavior.\n"
