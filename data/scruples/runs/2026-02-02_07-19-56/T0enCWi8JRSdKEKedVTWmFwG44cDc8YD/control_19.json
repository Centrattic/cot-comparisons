Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author, let's call them Person A, is a parent with a 3-year-old. They want to take the kid out for fun activities like a play center or a farm on the weekends. However, their partner, Person B, usually gives excuses: not wanting to go out, being too tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they have financial means. \n\nThis time, Person A's friend invited them to a farm, and Person A said yes. They mentioned it to Person B, who got upset, feeling it's unfair because he's at work and would like to go. Person A pointed out that they've previously asked and been denied. Now Person B wants to cancel so he can go another day, but Person A is refusing. \n\nThe question is whether Person A is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Person A is taking the child out while the partner is at work. The partner is unhappy because he can't join. The key issue seems to be about shared parenting responsibilities and communication.\n\nPerson A is trying to spend quality time with the child, which is a valid thing. However, the partner feels left out or frustrated because he's not involved. The partner's response might be a reaction to feeling excluded or not being part of the decision-making. \n\nBut there's also the fact that the partner has been consistently giving excuses in the past. Person A is now taking initiative to do something the child would enjoy, which the partner previously objected to. The partner might feel that the decision to go without him is a slight, even if it's not intentional. \n\nHowever, the partner's current reaction could be a bit extreme. If there was a prior pattern of the partner not wanting to participate, then Person A acting on their own might be reasonable. The partner's argument that it's unfair because he's at work might be about wanting to share in the parenting activities. But if Person A is willing to go whenever the partner is available, that should be a solution. The fact that the partner says it's not an option suggests a communication problem or a lack of flexibility. \n\nAnother angle: the cost is \u00a37 each, which isn't much. The partner's previous objections about money might be insincere if they can afford it. This could indicate that the excuses are about personal preference rather than financial constraints. \n\nIs Person A wrong for going ahead without the partner? Probably not, because parents can make decisions about their child's time. However, not involving the partner in the decision could be a problem if there's an expectation of joint decision-making. But since the partner has been uncooperative before, maybe Person A is justified in taking initiative. \n\nThe partner's frustration might stem from feeling excluded or not being considered. But Person A's actions are in the child's best interest, providing a fun activity. The partner's demand to cancel the plan might be unreasonable, especially if they could just go on another day as Person A offered. \n\nSo, the main factors: \n1. Shared parenting vs. individual decision-making.\n2. Past pattern of the partner's excuses.\n3. Validity of the partner's current complaints.\n4. Communication and willingness to compromise.\n\nGiven that Person A is trying to do something positive for the child, and the partner has previously been resistant without valid reasons, it's likely that Person A isn't in the wrong. The partner needs to work on their own issues with being included or dealing with past refusals. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
