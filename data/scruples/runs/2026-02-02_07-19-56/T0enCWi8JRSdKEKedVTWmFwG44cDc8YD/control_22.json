Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took their 3-year-old to a fun activity (a farm or play center) while their partner was at work. The partner gave excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author then made a plan with a friend to go to a farm, but the partner is upset and wants to cancel so he can go another day.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the partner's consistent refusal to participate in these activities and the author's decision to go without them. The author mentions that the partner often says \"I just wanna sit and play on the computer\" or is tired, even though the cost is low (\u00a37 each) and not a problem. The author's action was to take the child out when the partner wasn't available, which might be seen as reasonable since the parent wants to provide fun experiences for the kid. \n\nHowever, the partner is now upset because he wanted to go. The author did check with the partner before committing, pointing out that they had asked before and were refused. The author's friend invited them, and they said yes. The partner's reaction is about fairness because he's working, but the author is trying to take the child out. The question is whether the author overstepped by not including the partner. \n\nBut considering that the partner had previously refused multiple times, the author might be justified in making the decision to go without him. The activity isn't something that requires both parents, and it's in the child's best interest to have fun and social activities. Also, the author offered to go with the partner whenever he wants, which shows they're not being selfish. The partner's issue seems to stem from feeling left out or not prioritized, but the author was responding to the child's needs and their own desire to spend time with them. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
