Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a farm while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the partner consistently refuses to join outings with three common excuses: not wanting to go out, being tired from work, and not wanting to spend money. The author mentions they have enough money, so the cost isn't a real issue. The user went ahead and made plans with a friend to take the kid to a farm, which the partner then got upset about. The partner's main complaint is about fairness since he's at work and wants to go instead. The author argues that they were already told \"no\" before with similar excuses and that the event isn't exclusive (it's a petting zoo, not a movie).\n\nConsidering shared responsibilities in parenting, it's important that both parents contribute to the child's activities. However, if one parent is consistently unavailable or uncooperative, the other might need to step in. The author isn't taking the child to something exclusive or unnecessary\u2014it's a fun, family-friendly activity. The partner's reaction seems more about feeling left out or not being prioritized, but given his previous refusals, the author had a legitimate reason to proceed without him. The key points are the partner's repeated excuses and the author acting in the child's best interest. The author isn't being selfish; they're providing enrichment for the child when the other parent isn't able to. So, the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
