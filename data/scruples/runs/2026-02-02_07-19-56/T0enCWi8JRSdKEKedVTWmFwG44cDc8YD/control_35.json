Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves taking a 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work. The partner usually gives excuses for not going out on weekends. Now the author went ahead and made plans with a friend to take the kid to a farm, and the partner is upset because he's working and wants to go. The author points out that the partner often says they don't want to go because of money, being tired, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the repeated excuses from the partner, the author making a plan without the partner's input, and the partner's reaction. \n\nThe partner's excuses seem to be about not wanting to go, not money, since they have enough. The author took initiative to do something fun for the kid when the partner has been uninterested. The partner is upset because he's not included and wants to go instead. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might feel that they're the only one interested in taking the child out, and the partner isn't contributing. But the partner might feel left out or not involved in childcare activities. However, the author's actions aren't malicious; they're trying to provide for the child's well-being. \n\nThe partner's reaction could be about feeling excluded, but the activity is for the child, not a movie date. The fact that the partner had previously refused the same activities suggests a pattern of disinterest. The author's decision to go without the partner might be reasonable given the partner's past behavior. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're acting in the child's best interest after repeated refusals from the partner. The partner's issue is more about their own feelings rather than the child's needs. The author isn't obligated to cancel plans just because the partner is working and wants to participate later. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
