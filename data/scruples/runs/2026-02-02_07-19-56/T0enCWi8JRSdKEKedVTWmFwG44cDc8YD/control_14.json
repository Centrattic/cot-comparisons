Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity when the partner is at work. \n\nFirst, the partner consistently refuses to go out every weekend with excuses like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then decides to take their child to a farm with a friend when the partner is working, and the partner gets upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is trying to spend quality time with their child, which is a common and valid reason. The partner has been making excuses repeatedly, so maybe they're not being a very supportive parent. The cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which isn't too much, so money isn't really an issue. The author's action seems reasonable because they're not excluding the partner entirely; it's just a one-time thing when the partner is at work. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems a bit possessive or unfair. The author is just stepping in to provide an activity for the child, which is their responsibility as a parent. The fact that the partner wants to cancel the plans so he can go another day might indicate that he's not being cooperative. \n\nI think the author is in the right here. They're doing what's best for the child and taking initiative when the partner isn't available or willing. It's not about excluding the partner but ensuring the child has a good experience. So the answer should be B.\n"
