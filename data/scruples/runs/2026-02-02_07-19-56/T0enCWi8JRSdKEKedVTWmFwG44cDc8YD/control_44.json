Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old out for fun when their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author mentions that every weekend they suggest going out to places like a play center or farm, but the partner gives excuses. The partner doesn't want to go out, is tired, or doesn't want to spend money, even though they can afford it. Then the author agrees to take the child to a farm with a friend, but the partner gets upset because he's at work and feels left out. The author points out that previous times they asked, the partner refused for other reasons. Now the partner wants to cancel so he can go another day, but the author refuses.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for going ahead with the plans despite the partner's objections. The key points here are the partner's consistent excuses and the author's attempt to provide the child with activities. The partner's current objection seems to be about fairness, not practicality, since the cost is minimal (\u00a37 each) and the activity is a petting zoo, which is child-friendly.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being unfair by not including the partner. But the partner has previously refused to go out multiple times, so maybe the author is right to go without him this time. The author is fulfilling a responsibility to provide for the child's enjoyment, and the partner's objection now seems more about wanting to be included rather than a valid concern. The author's response of saying they can go whenever the partner wants is reasonable, but the partner isn't offering to go another time. It looks like the author isn't in the wrong here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
