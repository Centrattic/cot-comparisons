Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took their 3-year-old to a fun activity (a farm or play center) while their partner was at work. The partner usually gives excuses not to join, like being tired or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author then went with a friend to the farm without the partner, and the partner got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The partner's excuses seem consistent\u2014rejecting plans not because of money (since they can afford it) but because they don't want to go out. The author tried multiple times to go out with the kid, but the partner was uninterested. Now, the author took the child on their own when the partner was working. The partner is upset because he wanted to go but was at work.\n\nThe key points here are shared responsibility in parenting. Both parents should ideally have a say in the child's activities. However, if the partner has consistently refused to participate and the author just needs to take the child out for fun, maybe it's reasonable. But taking the child without the partner might be seen as not respecting the partner's potential role. However, the partner's previous refusals (not wanting to go, being tired, not wanting to spend money) might justify the author's decision to act alone.\n\nAnother angle is the cost. The activity is \u00a37 each, which isn't a huge expense, so the partner's objection here is questionable. The author might feel that since the partner was uncooperative in previous plans, it's okay to proceed without them. However, the partner might feel excluded or that the author is taking the child without considering their preferences.\n\nThe partner's reaction seems a bit unfair if he's only now wanting to join after consistently not participating. The author's response that they can go whenever the partner wants might be a reasonable compromise, but the partner isn't accepting that. It's possible that the partner is being passive-aggressive, using their workday as an excuse to feel left out.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are fulfilling the child's need for fun activities. However, not discussing the plan with the partner before going might be a misstep. But given the partner's history of refusing, maybe the author felt it was necessary to make the decision independently. The partner's current reaction seems more about feeling excluded than any real issue with the activity itself.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The partner's consistent refusal and the reasonable cost make the author's actions understandable. The answer should be B (No).\n"
