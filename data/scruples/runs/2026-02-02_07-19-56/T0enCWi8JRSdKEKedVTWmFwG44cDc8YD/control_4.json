Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the context: The author mentions that almost every weekend they want to take their kid to a play center or farm, but their partner uses excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author points out they have money, so it's not a real issue. Then, the author agreed to go to a farm with a friend, which the partner found out and got upset, saying it's unfair because he's at work. The author counters by saying they had asked before and were told no, so they thought it was okay to go on their own. The partner wants to cancel and go another day, but the author is fine with going whenever the partner wants.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in parenting and fairness in decision-making. The author's partner is making excuses for not participating in activities, but when the author takes initiative without them, the partner feels left out or that it's unfair. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything harmful to the child. The activity is a petting zoo, which is appropriate and not like a movie date. The partner's reaction seems more about feeling excluded rather than the activity itself. The author is also trying to provide a fun experience for the child, which is a valid parent's role. \n\nThe partner's excuses (not wanting to spend money, being tired) don't hold up since they have money and the cost is minimal. The author is taking responsibility for the child's enjoyment when the partner is unwilling. The partner's sudden objection when the author acts on their own might be about control or feeling left out, but the author isn't being selfish; they're fulfilling their role as a parent. \n\nIn such cases, it's common for one parent to take the initiative when the other is uninterested. The author isn't excluding the partner from all future activities; they\u2019re just going once. The partner is free to join later. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
