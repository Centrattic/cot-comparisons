Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, the partner regularly refuses to go out with excuses like being tired, not wanting to spend money, or just not interested. The author then takes the child to an event without the partner, which is a petting zoo, not a movie. The partner gets upset, saying it's unfair he's not there.\n\nI need to consider if the author did something wrong. The main points are: the partner often declines to participate, the author is trying to give the child an outing, and the cost isn't an issue. The partner's reaction seems to be about feeling left out or not being included. \n\nBut the author has been trying to do these outings for weeks, and the partner has consistently said no. The author isn't doing anything extravagant\u2014it's a \u00a37 ticket each. The partner's issue is more about wanting to go when they're available, but the author is taking initiative to do something the child would enjoy. \n\nIt seems like the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing the child's needs and the partner's excuses don't hold weight. The partner's reaction is more about personal feelings than the child's benefit. So the answer should be B.\n"
