Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the partner consistently gives excuses for not going out: tired, doesn't want to spend money, etc. The author mentions they have the money, so the financial excuse isn't valid. The partner also gets upset when the author goes without him, even though he's been the one refusing before. The activity is a children's petting zoo, which is kid-friendly and not something he'd typically go to, maybe. \n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibility in parenting. The author is trying to provide an outing for the child, which is reasonable. The partner's reaction seems to be more about feeling excluded or not being considered, but he's been the one refusing participation. The author is just stepping in to fulfill the child's need for fun activities. \n\nAlso, the cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which isn't a huge expense. The partner's previous excuses were about money and not wanting to go, so the author's decision to go without him when he's at work isn't necessarily wrong. The author is prioritizing the child's enjoyment and is making a plan with a friend, which is understandable. \n\nThe partner's anger might stem from feeling left out, but the author isn't obligated to include him if he's not interested. The main issue seems to be the partner's inconsistency in willingness to participate. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a reasonable choice based on the partner's previous behavior.\n"
