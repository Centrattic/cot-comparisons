Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nThe situation: The author has tried to take the kid out on weekends, but the partner usually gives excuses like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then decided to go with a friend to a farm when the partner is working. The partner gets upset about it, says it's unfair, and wants the author to cancel. The author points out that they had tried before and the partner refused, so they thought it was okay this time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness here. The partner's excuses seem to be about not wanting to go out, not being interested, and maybe feeling left out. The author is trying to provide the child with activities, which is a valid parent responsibility. The partner might be feeling neglected or not involved, but the author is taking initiative to do something the child needs or wants.\n\nThe key points are: the author had tried before and was met with resistance, so this time they went ahead without the partner. The partner is upset because they wanted to go. The author is not doing anything harmful to the child; they're providing a positive experience. The partner's complaints might be about feeling excluded rather than any real issue with the child's activity.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the partner is at work, so the author has every right to take the child out. The partner's objections seem more about their own feelings rather than the child's well-being. The author isn't being selfish; they're trying to give the child fun experiences despite the partner's previous reluctance. The partner's request to cancel seems unreasonable since the author had already made plans based on the partner's past refusals.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
