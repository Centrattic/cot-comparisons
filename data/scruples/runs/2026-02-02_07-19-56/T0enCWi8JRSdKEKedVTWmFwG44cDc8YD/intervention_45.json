Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work. The partner seems to consistently refuse to go out for various reasons, and the parent decides to go with a friend instead. The partner is upset because he can't join.\n\nFirst, the parent is trying to spend quality time with the child, which is important. The partner, on the other hand, has been making excuses like being tired, not wanting to spend money (which isn't an issue), or not feeling like going out. The parent felt they should take the child out since they hadn't done something fun in a while. The main conflict is that the partner felt it was unfair since he was at work and wanted to go.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent's actions seem justified because they're prioritizing the child's happiness and trying to balance their time. The partner's excuses don't seem valid, especially since the parent has tried multiple times and was denied. The cost is minimal (\u00a37), and the activity is a petting zoo, not a movie, so the partner's reaction might be overblown. The parent's friend invited them, and they accepted, which isn't unreasonable. The parent also offered to reschedule with the partner, which shows willingness to compromise. The partner's frustration might stem from feeling left out or not being considered, but that doesn't make the parent wrong for taking initiative to do something positive for their child. So, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
