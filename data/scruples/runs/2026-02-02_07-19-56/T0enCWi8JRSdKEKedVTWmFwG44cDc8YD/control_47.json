Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The user mentions that almost every weekend they suggest taking the kid to a play center or farm, but the partner gives excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. This has been happening consistently. Then, the user agreed to go to a farm with a friend, and when they told the partner, he reacted negatively, saying it's unfair because he's at work and wants to go. The user points out that they had previously been told no for similar reasons, and now the partner is upset about going alone. The user is frustrated because they're trying to do something for their child's benefit and their own need for a break, but the partner is not being supportive.\n\nNow, to determine if the user is in the wrong. The key factors here are the partner's consistent refusal to participate in activities, the user's initiative to take the child out, and the partner's reaction when the user proceeds without him. \n\nThe user isn't doing anything inherently wrong by taking the child out. Parents often take turns handling childcare duties. The partner's excuses seem to be more about personal preferences rather than genuine inability. The cost mentioned (\u00a37 each) is trivial, so that's not a valid reason. The partner's reaction seems to be more about not wanting to miss out or feeling left out, rather than a legitimate objection. The user is trying to balance their child's needs and their own, which is reasonable. The partner's behavior might indicate a lack of consideration for the user's efforts and possible resentment.\n\nHowever, the user did proceed without the partner, which could be seen as not considering the partner's feelings. But in this context, the partner has repeatedly refused to join, so the user might feel justified. The user is also trying to provide a positive experience for their child, which is a valid reason. The partner's desire to go another day isn't being met because the user has already committed. \n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. The partner's behavior is the issue here. The user is acting in the child's best interest and their own well-being, given the partner's consistent reluctance. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
