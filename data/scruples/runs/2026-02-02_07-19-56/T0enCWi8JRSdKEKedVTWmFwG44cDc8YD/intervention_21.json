Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity when the partner is at work. The situation involves some recurring arguments between the two partners.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that almost every weekend when they suggest taking the kid out to places like the play center or a farm, the partner gives the same excuses: not wanting to go, being tired from work, not wanting to spend money. They note that they have money, so it's not a real problem. Then the author decided to go with a friend to a farm, which is a children's petting zoo, and the partner got upset because he's at work and wants to go. The author points out that they tried before and got refused, so they went ahead without him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious to know what I think. I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nSo, considering the details: The partner has consistently refused to join these outings in the past, giving excuses that the author finds flimsy. The author took initiative to do something fun for their child, which is a common parental responsibility. The partner is now upset and wants to cancel the plans so he can go another day. The activity is a child-friendly place, not a date or something exclusive. \n\nThe key points here are about shared responsibilities in parenting. Both parents should ideally be involved in their child's activities, but if one parent is consistently not interested, the other should be able to take the child on their own. The partner's reaction seems a bit unfair because he was previously not interested and now is upset that the other went ahead without him. The author's action seems reasonable to provide a positive experience for the child. \n\nHowever, maybe the partner expects both to be present for such outings. But if the partner has been consistently avoiding it, the author might have a right to make decisions independently. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The partner's excuses might be more about not wanting to participate rather than actual reasons. \n\nIn parenting, it's common for one parent to take the child out while the other is unavailable. The author isn't going to a movie or a private event but a family-friendly place. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The partner might feel left out, but that's not the author's responsibility if the partner chose not to participate before. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
