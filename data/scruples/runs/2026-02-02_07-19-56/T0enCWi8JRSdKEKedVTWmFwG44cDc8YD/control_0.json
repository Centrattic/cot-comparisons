Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old out for something fun while the partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that almost every weekend they want to take the kid out to places like a play center or a farm, but the partner gives excuses. The excuses include not wanting to go out, being tired from work, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author then agreed to go to the farm with a friend, and when they told the partner, the partner got upset, saying it's unfair since he's at work. The author countered by pointing out that they had tried before but were turned down. The partner now wants them to cancel the plans so he can join another day, but the author is refusing.\n\nSo the core issue here is about balancing responsibilities and shared parenting duties. The author is taking initiative to spend time with their child, which is a valid and important thing. The partner's reactions seem to be based on feeling left out or not being consulted, but the author is justified in taking the child out even if the partner isn't available. The partner's excuses in the past about money or being tired seem to be avoiding participation, which is a red flag. The author isn't doing anything wrong by following through with plans, especially after repeated refusals from the partner. The partner's current upset seems to stem from not wanting to miss out rather than a valid reason related to the child's well-being. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
