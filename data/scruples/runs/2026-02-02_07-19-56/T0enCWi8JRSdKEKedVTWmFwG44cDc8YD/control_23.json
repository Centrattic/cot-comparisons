I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that every weekend when they suggest taking their child to a play center or a farm, the partner gives excuses. The excuses are about not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they have the money. The author then agreed to go to a farm with a friend and the kids, but when they told the partner, he got upset because he was at work and wanted to go. The author pointed out that they had asked before and been denied, and the cost was only \u00a37 each. The partner wants them to cancel, but the author says they can go whenever the partner wants, but that's not an option.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are about shared parenting responsibilities and communication. The author is taking the child out, which is a parenting activity. The partner is working, so maybe they feel excluded or that the author is not including them. However, the author mentions that the partner has previously refused to go out, which might indicate a pattern of not being involved in these activities. \n\nThe partner's reaction could stem from feeling left out, but if he's consistently avoiding these outings, is the author wrong for going without him? The cost isn't a real issue since they can afford it, so that's not a valid excuse. The author's reasoning is that since the partner has been unenthusiastic before, it's okay to take the child out with a friend. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not preventing the partner from going; the partner is the one who is unavailable or unwilling. The author is fulfilling their role as a parent by engaging the child in an activity. The partner's frustration might be about not being included, but if he's not been willing to participate when available, maybe the author isn't wrong for finding another way to involve the child. \n\nHowever, could there be a lack of communication or consideration? The author mentions they offered to go whenever the partner wants, but the partner doesn't want that. The author might be right in asserting their right to take the child out without the partner's presence, especially if the partner has been resistant before. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions seem justified. They are taking the child to a child-friendly activity, which is reasonable. The partner's objections seem more about personal preference rather than valid concerns. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
