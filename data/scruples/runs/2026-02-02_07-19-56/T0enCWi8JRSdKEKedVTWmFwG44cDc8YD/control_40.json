Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is at fault. They're taking their 3-year-old out to a farm while their partner is at work. The partner seems to give excuses every time they want to go out, like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author agreed to go with a friend and the kid, but the partner got upset and wants to cancel so he can go another day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the partner's consistent excuses and the author's decision to go without the partner. The partner is upset about being left out, but the author has tried to involve him before with no success. The activity is a petting zoo, which is kid-friendly, so maybe the partner's reaction is about feeling excluded rather than the child's needs.\n\nThe author is making an effort to spend time with their child, which is important. The partner's excuses seem to be about personal preferences (not wanting to go, tired, money) but since the author has money and the partner isn't contributing to the decision to take the child out, maybe the author isn't wrong. The partner might be feeling left out or not involved in parenting decisions, but the author has a right to make plans when the partner isn't available. \n\nI should check if there's any mention of prior agreements or shared responsibilities. The author points out that they tried before and the partner refused. So, maybe it's reasonable for the author to make plans without the partner when the partner is unavailable. The partner's reaction might be selfish or about control, but the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's enjoyment and their own social engagement with a friend. The cost is \u00a37, which isn't a big deal, so the partner's money complaint isn't valid. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
