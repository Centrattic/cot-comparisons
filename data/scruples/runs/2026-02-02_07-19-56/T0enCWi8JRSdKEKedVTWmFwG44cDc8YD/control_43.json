Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old child out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that they often suggest taking their child to places like a play center or a farm. Each time, the partner gives excuses like not wanting to go, being tired, not wanting to spend money, etc. The author then decides to take the child to a farm with a friend when the partner is working, which leads to the partner getting upset.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author is trying to spend quality time with their child, the partner consistently refuses to participate, and the author felt it was okay to go out without the partner when they were working. The partner is upset because they want to go but are at work, and the author cancels plans, which the partner now wants to change.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are mutual responsibility in parenting and communication. Parents usually share responsibilities, but the author is taking initiative here. The partner's consistent refusal might be an issue. If the partner is not contributing to childcare activities, maybe the author is justified in stepping in. However, the author didn't consult the partner about the specific plans again, even though they had previous issues. \n\nAlso, the partner might feel excluded or that their wants aren't being considered. The author mentions that they had asked a week or two ago and were refused, so this time they took action. But maybe the partner expected some coordination. However, the author argues that it's a children's petting zoo, not a movie date, so it's not about excluding the partner but providing for the child's needs.\n\nFinancially, the cost is \u00a37 each, which isn't a big issue. The partner's excuses seem like a pattern of avoiding participation. The author's actions could be seen as necessary to ensure the child gets out, especially if the partner isn't available or willing to engage.\n\nIn terms of fairness, parents often have to take turns doing things. If the partner is working, it's reasonable for the author to take the child. The partner might be upset about missing out, but the author isn't doing anything that requires the partner's presence. The main question is about shared parenting duties and whether the author overstepped by not considering the partner's feelings this time, despite past refusals.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling their role in providing for the child's social and recreational needs. The partner's consistent refusal is a separate issue. The author's decision to go without the partner when they're working is understandable, especially since the partner has previously declined. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling left out or not having their preferences considered, but the author's action is reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer is B (No).\n"
