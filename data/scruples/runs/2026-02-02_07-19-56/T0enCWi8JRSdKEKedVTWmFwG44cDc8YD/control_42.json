Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wants to take their kid to places like a play center or a farm on weekends. The partner usually gives excuses: not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author mentions they have money, so the cost isn't a real issue. \n\nThen, the author agreed to go to a farm with a friend. When they told the partner, he got upset because he was at work and wanted to go. The author points out that they had tried to go before but the partner didn't want to. The partner now wants to cancel and go another day. The author says they can go whenever the partner wants, but he's not interested. The author thinks it's just a petting zoo, not a movie.\n\nSo, the key points: The author is trying to spend quality time with their child when the partner isn't available, and the partner is being inflexible. The author is taking initiative to provide activities, and the partner's excuses are recurring. The author is standing their ground, which might be seen as reasonable because they're making an effort, but maybe the partner feels excluded or uninvolved.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, if the partner is consistently not interested and the author is trying to engage, maybe the author is right to take the child out. The partner's reaction might be about feeling left out rather than the activity itself. However, maybe the author should have considered the partner's feelings more, but the partner's prior excuses were about not wanting to participate. \n\nAlso, the cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so that's not a valid reason. The partner's refusal to go out when not at work might indicate a lack of involvement. The author's decision to go with a friend seems reasonable. The partner's anger about missing out might be immature. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should contribute to childcare. If the partner is at work, it's normal for one parent to take the child out alone. The author isn't doing anything wrong by providing the child with an activity when the other parent is unavailable. The partner's reaction seems more about their own preferences rather than the child's needs. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. The partner's behavior is the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
