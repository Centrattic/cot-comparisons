Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person (AITA) is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun place while the partner is at work. The partner usually makes excuses about not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author then takes the kid to a farm with a friend, and the partner gets upset because he's working and wants to go. The author mentions they had tried before and the partner refused for those reasons. Now the partner wants them to cancel, but the author is saying they can go whenever he wants.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the partner has been refusing to take the kid out on weekends with various excuses. The author is trying to provide the child with fun activities, which the partner isn't available for. The author is taking initiative here, which seems reasonable. The partner's reaction seems to be about not wanting to miss out, but he had previously declined for other reasons. The author is not being selfish; they're trying to do something the kid would enjoy when the other parent is unavailable. The cost is minimal (\u00a37), so financial excuses don't hold. The partner's sudden interest in joining might be more about his own feelings than the kid's needs. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in the child's best interest and the partner had previously refused. It's reasonable to take the child out when possible, especially when the other parent is working. The partner might need to adjust his expectations or communicate better about his availability. So the answer should be B.\n"
