Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that almost every weekend they try to take the kid out, but the partner gives excuses like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then took the child to a farm with a friend because the partner was at work, and the partner got upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and responsibilities. The author feels that since the partner is often uncooperative, they needed to take initiative to give the child some fun outings. The partner, on the other hand, feels left out and wants to go, but the author cancels plans when the partner is working.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the partner's repeated excuses might make it hard for the author to plan activities. However, there's a nuance. The author did involve the partner in the planning but got rejected before. Now, when there's an opportunity with a friend, they take it. But maybe the partner felt excluded. \n\nThe author could have communicated better, maybe checked if the partner had a different plan or if there's a way to include him next time. But given the partner's previous reluctance, the author's actions might be justified. The cost is low, and it's a family-friendly activity. The partner's reaction seems more about feeling left out than the actual activity itself. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for the partner to feel slighted. The main issue is the partner's consistent uncooperativeness, which the author is trying to counterbalance. The author isn't doing anything harmful; they're trying to provide for their child's well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
