Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a farm while the partner is at work. The partner has been making excuses every weekend, like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author decided to go with a friend to a petting zoo, which the partner then got upset about, saying it's unfair because he's working and wants to go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The partner is consistently not engaging in activities with the child, giving excuses that don't seem valid. The author is trying to provide a fun experience for the kid when the partner isn't available. The partner is now upset that the author went without him, even though he's been the one refusing to participate. \n\nThe key points are: the partner's excuses are repeated and not genuine (they have money, so the cost isn't an issue), the author is acting in the child's best interest by getting them out, and the partner seems to be expecting to be included every time, even when he's been the one declining. The author isn't going to a movie alone; it's a family-friendly activity with a friend, which is reasonable. \n\nThe partner's reaction might stem from feeling left out or resentful, but if he's been the one not participating, the author isn't at fault for taking initiative. The argument is about fairness, but fairness would mean both parents take turns. Since the partner is working, the author is filling that gap. \n\nI don't see the author doing anything wrong. They're providing for their child's needs when the partner isn't able or willing. The partner's issues are with their own behavior and expectations. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
