Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work. The partner consistently gives excuses not to go out, and the author decides to take the child without them, which the partner is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that almost every weekend they want to take the kid out, but the partner refuses with various excuses. The partner says they're tired, don't want to spend money (which they can afford), or just don't feel like going. The author then takes the child to a farm with a friend, which the partner objects to because they're at work and feel left out. The author argues that they had tried before and were turned down, and the partner's complaints now are unfair.\n\nI think the key points are about shared responsibility in parenting and fairness. The author is trying to provide an experience for the child, which is a valid reason. The partner's issues seem to be about feeling excluded and possibly not wanting to take their share of the parenting duties. The author isn't going to a movie or something that's adult-only; it's a family-friendly event. The partner's reaction might be about not being involved rather than the activity itself. The author had already received consistent \"no\" responses from the partner before deciding to go. Also, the cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't an issue. It seems like the partner is being inconsistent\u2014saying no when available but upset when the author goes without them. \n\nAnother angle: If the partner is working, maybe they feel their time with the family is being neglected. But the author is making an effort to engage the child in activities when the partner isn't available. Parenting can be a shared responsibility, but if one parent is consistently refusing to participate, the other should have the autonomy to make decisions for the child's benefit. The author isn't doing something harmful; it's a positive activity. The partner's reaction seems more about their own feelings of exclusion rather than a valid concern for the child or finances. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting in the child's interest despite the partner's previous refusals. The partner's issues might be about communication or sharing parenting roles, but the decision to take the child out isn't wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
