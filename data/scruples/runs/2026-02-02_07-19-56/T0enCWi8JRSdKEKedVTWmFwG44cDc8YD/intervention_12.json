Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their partner have been having this issue every weekend. The author wants to take the kid out to places like a play centre or a farm. The partner consistently gives excuses\u2014like not wanting to go, being tired, not wanting to spend money, even though they have money. The author then makes plans with a friend to go to a farm, mentions it to the partner, and the partner gets upset, saying it's unfair because he's working. The author points out that they've been told no before for similar reasons, and the cost is only \u00a37 each. The partner wants them to cancel so he can go another day, but the author is resistant.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to get another opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in childcare and communication. The author is trying to engage in a fun activity for the child, which is reasonable. The partner, however, has been consistently declining these plans. Then, when the author takes the initiative to go without the partner, the partner feels it's unfair. \n\nBut wait, the partner was at work. So the author isn't taking the child away from the partner; they're just using a time when the partner isn't available. The author also mentions that the partner's reasons for not going before were not valid (they have money, and the partner just didn't feel like going). So the author is acting in the child's best interest. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to be more about feeling excluded or not being prioritized, but if the partner consistently refuses to participate, is it fair to expect the author to always wait? The author is trying to be proactive. \n\nAlso, the cost is low (\u00a37), so it's not a financial issue. The partner's main issue seems to be about the author making plans without him. But if the partner has been dismissing the plans before, maybe the author is justified in taking the initiative. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed it more with the partner before making plans. But the author does mention the plans, and the partner gets upset. The partner is then asking to cancel so he can go another day, but the author isn't obligated to do that if the partner kept refusing before. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to provide a fun experience for the child, the partner has been uncooperative, and the author is taking matters into their own hands when the partner isn't available. The partner's reaction seems to be about not wanting to be excluded without a good reason. \n\nBut maybe there's an element of not communicating better. However, given the partner's consistent refusals, the author's actions seem reasonable. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
