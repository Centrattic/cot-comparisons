Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The parent regularly suggests taking their child to places like a play center or farm on weekends. Each time, the partner comes up with excuses\u2014like not wanting to go out, being tired from work, or not wanting to spend money. The couple has the financial means, so money isn't an issue. This time, the parent agreed to go with a friend to a farm, mentioned it to the partner, who got upset because he wasn't there. The parent pointed out that previous times they wanted to go, the partner declined with similar excuses. The partner now wants to cancel the plans so he can join later, but the parent refuses, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The parent is trying to spend quality time with their child, which is important for the child's development and bonding. The partner's repeated excuses might indicate a lack of engagement in childcare or shared responsibilities. The parent is taking initiative to provide the child with enriching experiences, which is a valid and responsible action. The cost mentioned (\u00a37 each) is minimal, so the partner's objection isn't justified on financial grounds. The parent isn't going to a movie alone but to a family-friendly activity with a friend, which is reasonable. The partner's reaction seems to stem from feeling left out or not being consulted, but the parent's actions are within their right to make decisions for their child's well-being. The key is whether the parent overstepped by not including the partner, but since the partner previously refused similar outings, the parent isn't obligated to cancel plans made with a friend. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
