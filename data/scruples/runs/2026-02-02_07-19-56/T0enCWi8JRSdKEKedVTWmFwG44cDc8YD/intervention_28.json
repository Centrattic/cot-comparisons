Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a 3-year-old out for fun while the partner is at work. The partner often refuses to go out and gives excuses like being tired, not wanting to spend money, or not feeling like going. The author then decides to take the kid to a farm with a friend, but the partner gets upset and wants to cancel so he can go later.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for doing this. The partner's excuses seem to be about not wanting to participate, but the author felt it was necessary to take the child out. The cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which the couple can afford. The author is frustrated because the partner refuses previous plans and now is upset when they take initiative.\n\nThe author's actions are taking the child out when the partner is at work. The partner feels left out or that the author is excluding him. But the partner has consistently refused similar plans before. The author is trying to provide a fun activity for the child, which seems reasonable. The partner's reaction might be about feeling neglected or not being involved, but the author's actions are justified if the partner wasn't willing to participate before.\n\nI need to consider fairness and communication. The author tried to make plans before, but the partner said no. Now the author is acting on their own. It's about balancing the child's needs and the partner's feelings. If the partner is consistently not engaging, the author might need to step in. However, the partner might feel excluded. But given the previous refusals, maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
