Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about taking a 3-year-old out for fun activities while the partner is at work. The author mentions that almost every weekend when they suggest going out, the partner gives excuses like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then goes ahead and books a trip with a friend to a farm, which the partner gets upset about, feeling it's unfair since he's at work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is taking initiative to spend quality time with their child, which is a good thing. However, the partner feels left out or that his input isn't considered. The author's partner might feel that since he's working, the author should wait until he's available. But the author points out that when they tried to go out before, the partner didn't want to go. So there's a pattern here where the partner isn't engaging in these activities, but the author is trying to do something for the child.\n\nThe key points are communication and fairness. Did the author communicate their plans sufficiently with the partner? The author mentioned the trip to the farm to the partner and got a negative reaction. The partner might feel that the author didn't consider his feelings or that the author is overstepping. On the other hand, the author is trying to provide for the child's needs and their own needs as a parent, which is important.\n\nAlso, the cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which isn't a big issue financially, so the partner's objection about money isn't valid. The partner's main issue seems to be about being excluded. The author might be right in that they can't wait for the partner every time, especially if the partner consistently refuses to participate. But then again, maybe the author could have discussed it more thoroughly or checked if the partner wanted to join before committing. However, the author tried multiple times and got the same excuses each time.\n\nThe author's decision to go without the partner to a children's petting zoo (which is a family-friendly activity) might be seen as reasonable because it's about the child's well-being. The partner's reaction could be a bit hypersensitive if he's not contributing to the child's activities when he's not working. The author isn't going to a movie without him, which is a more adult-oriented activity, so the comparison isn't fair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should share responsibilities and be flexible. The author isn't wrong for trying to provide fun activities for the child when the partner isn't available or willing. The partner might need to adjust his expectations and recognize that the author can't wait on him all the time, especially if he's not interested in those activities. The author's action seems justified given the partner's consistent pattern of refusal. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
