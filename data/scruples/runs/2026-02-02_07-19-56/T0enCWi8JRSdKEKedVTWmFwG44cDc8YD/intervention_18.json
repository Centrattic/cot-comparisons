Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. The partner gives excuses every time they suggest going out, like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then agreed to take the kid to a farm with a friend because it's been a while since they did something fun. The partner got upset and wants to cancel so he can go another day. The author says they can go whenever the partner wants, but he doesn't want to do that.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and shared responsibility. The partner is working, so maybe he's not available on weekends. The author is taking the initiative to do something with the child, which the partner seems unhappy about. The partner's excuses seem to be about personal preferences, not actual inability. The cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which isn't too high. The author is frustrated with the partner's repeated refusals. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the description, it sounds like the author is trying to give the child a fun experience, which is important for a 3-year-old. The partner might feel left out or not involved in the decision-making. But the author didn't take the child out without the partner's consent; they just went ahead when the partner was at work. The partner's reaction could be about feeling excluded or not being considered. However, the author has been trying before and getting rejected, so maybe it's time they take charge when possible. \n\nI think the partner's reaction is a bit of a problem because he's using work as a reason, but maybe he's not been cooperative when he's free. The author is acting in the best interest of the child, so that might not be in the wrong. But there's a communication issue. The author should have discussed it with the partner first, but since the partner has been uncooperative before, maybe it's understandable. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. The partner might feel it's unfair, but the author is making an effort when the partner is unavailable. So probably B.\n"
