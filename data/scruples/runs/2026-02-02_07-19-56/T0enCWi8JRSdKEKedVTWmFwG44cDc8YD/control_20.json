Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while their partner is at work. I need to analyze the situation and decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the context: The author mentions that they try to take their child out on weekends, but the partner consistently refuses with excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money (even though they can afford it). The author then arranged for the child to go to a farm with a friend while the partner is at work. The partner is upset about this, wanting to cancel and go another day. The author argues that they've been denied before and the activity isn't expensive.\n\nSo, the key points here. The parent wants to take their child out, which is a reasonable thing. The partner is not helping out, giving excuses, and the author is trying to make the child happy by going out. The partner is now upset that the author didn't include them. But the author has been trying for weeks and was repeatedly denied. The cost is minimal (\u00a37), so money isn't a real issue. The partner is at work, so maybe they can't go, but the author is suggesting they can go another day. The partner seems to be upset about not being included, but the author isn't obligated to take them every time.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is trying to parent and spend time with the child, which is important. The partner's constant refusals and now being upset about not being included might indicate a lack of support or flexibility. The author's action seems justified because they're making an effort when the partner isn't available or willing. The partner's reaction seems more about not wanting to miss out rather than the child's well-being. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
