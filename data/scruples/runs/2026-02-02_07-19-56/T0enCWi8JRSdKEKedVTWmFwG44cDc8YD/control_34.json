Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while the partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The partner consistently refuses to join in weekend activities with the kids, giving excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money\u2014even though they have money. The author then plans a trip with a friend and the kids, but the partner gets upset about it. The author argues that since the partner didn't want to go before, it's okay now, and the partner wants to cancel the plans so he can go another day.\n\nKey points here: The partner isn't contributing to the childcare or activities, is making excuses, and is now upset when the author takes initiative. The author is trying to provide something fun for the child. The cost is low (\u00a37 each), so money isn't an issue. The author isn't doing something that requires the partner's presence, just taking the kid out, which is reasonable.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the partner's complaints might be about feeling left out, but the author has tried and been rejected multiple times. The author is acting in the child's best interest. The partner might feel neglected, but the author isn't doing anything wrong by fulfilling the child's need for fun activities. The partner's reaction seems to be more about his own feelings rather than the child's.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The author is making a reasonable choice to engage with their child, especially since the partner hasn't participated. The partner's reaction is more about his own dissatisfaction than the action itself.\n"
