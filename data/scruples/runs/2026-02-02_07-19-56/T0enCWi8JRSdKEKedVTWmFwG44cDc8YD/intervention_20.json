Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a farm or play center when the partner is at work. The partner consistently gives excuses not to go out, and the author decided to go with a friend instead, which upset the partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The partner is working weekends, so maybe they're busy. The author is trying to do something fun for the kid. The partner's excuses are about not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author thought it was reasonable to take the child without the partner since the partner was unavailable and had refused before.\n\nThe partner then gets upset when the author goes ahead, saying it's unfair because he wants to go. The author points out that previous requests were denied. The partner wants them to cancel so he can go another day, but the author is not willing. The author argues it's just a kids' petting zoo, not a movie or something exclusive.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're trying to do something good for the child, and the partner has consistently not wanted to participate. The partner might feel left out or not included in the child's activities, which could be a valid feeling. However, the author is also trying to be a parent independently, which is a valid point too.\n\nThe key issues here are shared parenting responsibilities and communication. The partner might feel that the author is making decisions without consulting them, but the author is reacting to repeated refusals. The cost is minimal, so money isn't a real issue. The partner's reaction seems more about not wanting to miss out rather than a legitimate problem.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling their role as a parent by ensuring the child has fun and social activities. The partner's refusal to participate before might mean the author is stepping in where the partner isn't. However, maybe the author should have discussed it more, but given the partner's past behavior, maybe they felt it was necessary to proceed without them. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
