Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. The partner usually gives excuses for not going out, like being tired, not wanting to spend money (even though they have money), or not feeling like driving. The author then agrees to take the kid to a farm with a friend on a day the partner isn't there, and the partner gets upset, wanting to cancel so he can go instead. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in parenting and communication. The partner is working, so the author is stepping in to take the child out, which seems reasonable. The partner's excuses seem to be about convenience or personal preference, not actual inability. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The author is taking initiative to do something the child would enjoy, and the partner is reacting negatively because he wants to go but is at work. \n\nThe author is pointing out that the partner has previously refused similar outings, so this is a way to fulfill the child's need for fun activities. The partner's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or not being considered. However, the author is within their rights to make decisions about their child's activities, especially when the other parent isn't available. The partner's request to cancel the plans so he can go might be more about his own feelings than the child's needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable choice to provide a fun outing for their child when the partner isn't available, despite the partner's previous excuses. The partner might need to reflect on his own behavior and willingness to participate in family activities. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
