Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to do something fun while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author mentions that every weekend they want to take their kid to places like a play center or a farm. But the partner keeps giving excuses: not wanting to go out, being tired from work, or not wanting to spend money even though they can afford it. The author then agreed to go to a farm with a friend, which the partner found out. The partner got upset, saying it's unfair because he's at work and would like to go. The author countered by pointing out that the partner had previously refused similar plans.\n\nNow, the key points here are about shared responsibility in parenting and fairness. The author feels they're being unreasonable by not being allowed to take the child out alone, while the partner feels it's unfair that the author went without them. The author might argue that since the partner has consistently refused to participate, this is a reasonable alternative. On the other hand, the partner might feel that the author didn't consider their feelings, even if they were busy or tired.\n\nAnother angle is the cost. The author mentions the cost is \u00a37 each, which isn't a big deal. So money isn't the real issue. The partner's excuses seem more about preference or fatigue. The author's action could be seen as taking initiative to provide an experience for the child, especially if the partner isn't available. However, communication is key here. The author might be right in trying to make plans despite the partner's reluctance, but maybe they didn't consult enough or consider the partner's feelings.\n\nWait, the author did mention the plan to the partner, but the partner reacted negatively. The author then decided to go anyway. Is that wrong? It depends on how the partner wants to handle co-parenting. If the partner expects to be included in such decisions, then the author might have overlooked that. But if the partner has been consistently uncooperative, the author is trying to make the best choice for the child. \n\nHmm. The partner's reaction seems a bit over the top, given their previous excuses. The author is trying to fulfill the child's need for activities, which is important. The partner's desire to go another day might be valid, but the author is not in the wrong for taking the initiative when the partner isn't available. The partner's behavior of giving excuses might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to provide for the child despite the partner's reluctance. The partner might need to reflect on their own behavior. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
