Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while their partner is at work. The partner consistently refuses to join due to various excuses like being tired, not wanting to spend money, or not feeling up for it. The author then decided to go with a friend instead, which upset the partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parent is trying to provide an outing for their child, which is a common parenting responsibility. The partner's excuses are being questioned, especially since they mention having money and the cost isn't prohibitive. The author's decision to go without the partner seems reasonable if the partner isn't willing to participate. \n\nIt's important to note that parents often take children to activities alone while the other parent works. The key issue here might be communication and expectations. The author asked to go out before and was turned down each time. Now, when they decide to go with a friend, the partner feels it's unfair. However, the author's action isn't preventing the partner from attending the activity later; it's just a different time.\n\nI should check if there's any mention of previous agreements about splitting responsibilities or if the partner's feelings were valid. The author is pointing out the inconsistency of the partner's excuses. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The partner's reaction seems more about feeling excluded rather than a valid reason related to the child's needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent is doing their duty by engaging with the child and providing enrichment. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling left out or not being considered. However, the author isn't obligated to always include the partner in every outing, especially if the partner isn't willing to participate.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is the parent overstepping by going without the partner? Or is it reasonable to make decisions independently when the partner isn't engaged? The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're fulfilling their role as a parent and the partner's objections seem based on personal feelings rather than the child's best interest.\n"
