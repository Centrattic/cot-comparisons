Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a partner taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while the other partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author mentions that almost every time they suggest taking the kid out, the partner comes up with excuses like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. They have the money, so it's not a financial issue. Now, the author went ahead and made plans with a friend to take the kid to a farm because they hadn't done anything fun for a few weeks. The partner got upset because he was at work and wanted to go, but the author pointed out that previously when they asked, the partner said no because of cost or not wanting to go. The partner now wants to cancel the plans so he can go another day, but the author is refusing. The author argues it's a kids' petting zoo, not a movie date.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The partner's excuses seem to be about personal preference\u2014being tired, not wanting to spend money (even though they can), and not wanting to go out. The author is taking initiative to provide a fun activity for the child. The partner is now upset because the author went ahead without them. The key points here are: shared parenting responsibilities, communication, and mutual agreement.\n\nThe author's actions might be seen as reasonable because they are addressing the child's need for fun activities. However, they didn't include the partner in the decision, which could be a point of contention. But the partner had previously refused similar plans. The author might feel that since the partner is uncooperative, they have a right to take the child out. On the other hand, the partner might feel left out or not included in parenting decisions.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the partner consistently refuses to participate in activities, the author has a right to step in to ensure the child's well-being. However, the partner might feel that the author didn't consider their feelings. But given the history of excuses, it's possible the partner is being passive-aggressive now. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The author's friend invited them, which is a social aspect too. \n\nI think the main issue is about shared responsibility and communication. The author isn't wrong for taking initiative, especially when the partner has been uncooperative. The partner might need to address their own feelings but shouldn't expect to have the plans canceled after being the one to refuse them before. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
