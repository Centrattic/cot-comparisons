Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while the partner is at work. The partner has been making excuses in the past, and now the parent arranged a trip, but the partner is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parent is trying to spend quality time with their child. The partner has consistently refused past plans with various excuses\u2014like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The parent now went ahead with a plan when the partner was working, and the partner is upset. The cost is \u00a37 per person, which they can afford. The activity is a children's petting zoo, so it's family-friendly, not an exclusive event.\n\nThe parent's actions seem reasonable. They're prioritizing their child's well-being by providing fun outings, which is important for a 3-year-old. The partner's excuses might be valid in some contexts, but since they've been consistent, it's possible the partner is not making an effort. The parent isn't doing anything harmful by going without the partner, especially since the partner was working. The partner's reaction seems to be about fairness, but if they've been the ones to cancel before, the parent isn't at fault for following through.\n\nAlso, the parent offered flexibility, saying they can go another day when the partner is available. The partner's insistence on changing the plans now might be unreasonable. The key here is whether the parent acted wrongfully by going ahead without the partner. Since the parent made an effort to involve the child and the partner had previously refused, the parent's actions are justifiable. So the answer is B.\n"
