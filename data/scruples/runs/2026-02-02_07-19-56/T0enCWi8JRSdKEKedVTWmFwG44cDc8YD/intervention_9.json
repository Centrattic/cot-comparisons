Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple with a 3-year-old child. The author wants to take the kid to a fun place like a play center or a farm on the weekends. But the partner keeps giving excuses not to go, like being too tired, not wanting to spend money even though they have money, or not wanting to drive. The author then decides to go with a friend to a farm, but the partner gets upset because he's at work and wants to go. The author cancels with the friend, and the partner still isn't happy. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The author is trying to do something for the child's benefit, taking them to a fun activity. The partner, on the other hand, is consistently not interested in these outings, giving excuses. The author then takes the child without the partner, which the partner objects to. \n\nIs it wrong to take the child out without the partner when the partner isn't interested? Well, maybe the partner feels included or left out, but if the partner has been consistently not wanting to participate, maybe the author is justified in making plans without them. Also, the cost is \u00a37 each, which isn't much, so the partner's objection about money isn't valid. The author is prioritizing the child's enjoyment, which is a common parent's concern. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation in the relationship that both parents should be involved in such activities. If the partner feels excluded, then the author might not have considered that. However, the partner has been the one refusing to go each time, making the author feel like they can't plan anything. So the author is acting on their own initiative when the other parent isn't contributing. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the partner is at work and can't go, maybe the author is just using that time to take the child. But maybe the partner feels that the author should have discussed it more or waited until both can attend. However, the author points out that the partner has been rejecting plans for weeks, so the author is taking initiative. \n\nAnother angle is that the partner is now upset after the fact, wanting to reschedule. The author says they can go whenever the partner wants, but the partner isn't accepting that. The partner's reaction might be about feeling left out or not being considered, but if the partner was the one who kept declining, maybe the author isn't at fault. \n\nI think the key points here are the partner's consistent refusal and the author's attempt to engage the child in activities despite that. The author isn't doing something that's harmful or exclusive in a bad way; it's a children's activity. The partner's reaction seems more about feeling excluded, but if they were the ones who didn't want to participate in the first place, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
