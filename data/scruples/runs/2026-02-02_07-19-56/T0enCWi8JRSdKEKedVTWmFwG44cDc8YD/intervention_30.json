Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author taking their 3-year-old child out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. The partner is upset because they wanted to go but are working, and the author had previously been turned down when suggesting similar outings.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author mentions that every weekend they try to take the kid out, but the partner consistently gives excuses like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then arranges a trip with a friend to a petting zoo when the partner is working, which the partner is upset about, arguing it's unfair. The author points out that they had asked before and were told no, and that the partner is now changing their stance because they can't join.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) the partner's previous excuses, 2) the author taking initiative to plan an outing when the partner is unavailable, and 3) the partner's reaction being upset and wanting to cancel the plans. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this.\n\nI need to consider shared responsibilities in parenting. Both parents should contribute to childcare. If the partner is consistently declining to take on weekend responsibilities, maybe that's an issue. But the author is taking the child out, which is a good thing. However, the partner might feel excluded or not involved enough, leading to resentment. The author's action of going without the partner could be seen as not including them, but if the partner has consistently refused to participate, maybe the author is justified in taking the child alone.\n\nAlso, the cost is \u00a37 per child, which isn't a huge expense. The partner's complaint about money seems insincere given they have the money. The author's friend is involved, which might be a social aspect they value for the child. The partner's reaction seems to be more about being left out rather than the activity itself. The author's response that they can go whenever the partner wants is reasonable, but the partner might feel that the author isn't considering their feelings.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the partner is often unavailable due to work, the author's initiative is proactive. However, the partner might feel that the author isn't sharing the parenting duties equally, leading to conflict. The author might not be in the wrong here because they're taking responsibility when the partner is not. But the partner's feelings aren't being considered either, possibly leading to a deeper issue in their relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on whether the partner's previous excuses were valid or if the author is overstepping by not including the partner. If the partner has a history of not participating, the author is justified. If the partner is genuinely trying to be involved but the author is excluding them, then the author is in the wrong. The scenario suggests the partner has been uncooperative, so the author's actions are reasonable.\n"
