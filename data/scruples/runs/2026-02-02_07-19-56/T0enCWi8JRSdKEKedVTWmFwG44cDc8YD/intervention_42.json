Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. The partner has previously declined similar outings for various reasons like being tired, not wanting to play on the computer, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author took the initiative to go to a farm with a friend's kids, which the partner then got upset about, feeling it's unfair since he's working.\n\nSo, the main points here are: The author tried to take the child out multiple times but was met with excuses each time. When the author finally went without the partner, the partner is upset. The author argues that they were denied before, and this isn't an exclusive activity like a movie. The partner wants to cancel and go another day. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the partner had consistently refused to go out and now is upset that the author went without him, there's a conflict in expectations. The author might feel they're being unfairly restricted and are taking responsibility for the child's activities. The partner might feel excluded or that the author is making decisions without considering him. However, the author is acting in the child's best interest by providing a fun outing, especially if the partner isn't available. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The fact that the author went with a friend might add to the partner's feelings of being left out, but the activity is kid-focused, not a social event for the adults. \n\nThe partner's reaction could be seen as overreacting, especially if the author had been trying to plan these outings and the partner had been uncooperative. The author's action might be a reasonable response to the partner's previous refusals. So, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would depend on whether the partner's expectations were communicated clearly and if the author's actions are a fair response to the lack of support from the partner.\n"
