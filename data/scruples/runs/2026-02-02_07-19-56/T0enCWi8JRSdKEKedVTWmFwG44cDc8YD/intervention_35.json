Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity when the partner is at work. The partner consistently gives excuses for not going out on weekends, and the author decided to go with a friend instead. Now the partner is upset because he wants to go too.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The partner's excuses are about not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author took the initiative to plan something fun for the kid, which the partner seems to be upset about. The partner is now asking to cancel the plans so he can go another day, but the author is saying they can go whenever he wants.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the partner might feel left out or that his preferences aren't being considered. On the other hand, the parent is trying to provide a fun experience for the child, especially when the other parent isn't interested in going. The author points out that the partner has been uninterested in previous outings, so this was a way to get the kid out for fun without the partner's participation.\n\nPossible factors to consider: shared responsibilities in parenting, communication issues, whether the author should have included the partner, and if the partner's reaction is reasonable. The partner might feel that both parents should share in taking the child out, but if the author has tried multiple times and the partner refuses, maybe the author is justified in taking initiative.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're making an effort to engage with their child when the partner isn't participating. The partner's excuses seem to be about personal preferences rather than valid reasons. The cost is minimal (\u00a37), so money isn't a real issue. The author's action is about the child's benefit, and the partner's reaction could indicate a need for better communication or compromise in their relationship. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
