Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity when their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the partner regularly refuses to go out with excuses like being tired or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author then takes the kid to a farm with a friend when the partner is working. The partner gets upset and wants to cancel the plans so he can go another day. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the partner has been consistently making excuses for not going out, the author is trying to provide an outing for the child, and the partner is now upset that the author made plans without him. The author argues that they were denied before and now the partner is being unfair.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're trying to make time for their child, and the partner's consistent refusal and then getting upset when the author takes initiative seems like the issue. The author isn't excluding the partner without reason; the partner has been uncooperative. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), and it's a kid-friendly activity. The author is offering flexibility to go another time, but the partner isn't taking it. So, the answer should be B.\n"
