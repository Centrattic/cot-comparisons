Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, the partner has consistently refused to go out on weekends, giving excuses like being tired, not wanting to spend money (even though they can afford it), or not feeling like driving. The author decided to go with a friend to a farm, which is a kids' activity, and the partner is upset because he's at work and wants to go another day.\n\nSo, the author's actions: They took the initiative to plan something for the child, considering the partner's previous refusals. The partner is now upset about being excluded. The key points here are about shared responsibility in parenting and fairness.\n\nThe author isn't going to a movie by themselves; it's a family-friendly event with the child and a friend. The partner's reaction seems to be about not wanting to miss out, but the author has already tried to involve him before, which he declined. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, both parents should share in childcare responsibilities. However, the partner has been avoiding these outings, so maybe the author is right to step in. The partner's sudden objection when it's the author's turn to take the child might be about his own feelings of exclusion rather than the child's needs. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything harmful; they're giving the child an enriching experience. The partner's excuses seem to be more about his own preferences than the child's well-being. So, the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision that benefits the child, especially after repeated refusals from the partner. The answer would be B (No).\n"
