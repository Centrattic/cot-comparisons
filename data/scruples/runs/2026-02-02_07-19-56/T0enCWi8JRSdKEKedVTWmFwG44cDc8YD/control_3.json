Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that they often want to take their child to places like a play center or a farm, but their partner consistently gives excuses not to go\u2014like not wanting to go out, being tired from work, or not wanting to spend money. The author then decided to go to a farm with a friend the next day even though the partner was at work. The partner got upset about this, saying it's unfair, and now wants the author to cancel the plans so he can go another day. The author is frustrated because the partner had previously made similar excuses and now is upset when they went without him.\n\nSo, the key points here are about shared responsibilities and communication. The author feels they're doing their part by taking the child out when the partner is unavailable, but the partner feels left out or not considered. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think it's important to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to provide their child with fun activities, which is a valid reason. However, the partner might feel excluded or not involved in the decision-making. But the author has tried to go before and been met with resistance. The partner's reaction now seems to be about fairness, but maybe they didn't communicate their own desire to participate earlier. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything inherently wrong by taking the child out alone, especially since the partner had consistently refused earlier. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The author's action shows initiative to give the child a good experience. However, maybe the author should have discussed the plan more thoroughly with the partner beforehand, but since the partner had been dismissive in the past, the author might have felt it was necessary to proceed without them. \n\nThe partner's frustration might stem from feeling neglected or not being part of the family activities. But the author has a valid point about the partner's previous excuses. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling their role as a parent and have been met with resistance in the past. The partner needs to communicate their needs better and find a compromise rather than trying to cancel existing plans.\n"
