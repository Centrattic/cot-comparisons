Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that every weekend they suggest going to places like a play center or a farm, but the partner always comes up with excuses. The partner says they don't want to go out, are tired, or don't want to spend money. The author then decides to go with a friend to a farm, and the partner gets upset about it, saying it's unfair because he's at work and wants to go. The author points out that when they asked before, the partner said no. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details.\n\nThe key points here are the partner's consistent refusals and the author's decision to take the child out when the partner isn't available. The partner is at work, so maybe he's not available. The author is trying to provide a fun experience for the child. The partner's reaction seems to be about not wanting to miss out, but the author was already denied multiple times before. \n\nThe cost is \u00a37 each, which the author says isn't a problem financially. The partner's excuses might be valid if they are tired from work, but if it's a recurring issue, maybe the author is justified in making the decision without the partner. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to spend quality time with the child, which is important. The partner's desire to go on a different day should be considered, but the author is being reasonable by saying they can go another day. The partner's frustration might stem from feeling left out, but the author has been trying for a while without success. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the parent should have the ability to make plans without needing the other partner to be present every time, especially if the other is unavailable. The author isn't going to a movie without the partner; it's a family-friendly activity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The partner's behavior of always saying no and then getting upset when the author takes initiative might be the real issue here. The author is acting in the child's best interest and their own need for a break and fun, especially when the partner isn't available. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
