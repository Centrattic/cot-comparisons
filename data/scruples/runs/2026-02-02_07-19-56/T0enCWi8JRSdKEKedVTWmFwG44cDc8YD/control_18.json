Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity when their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that whenever they suggest doing something fun like a play centre or a farm, their partner gives excuses. The excuses are things like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. They note that the partner says they have money, so the cost isn't a real issue. The latest instance is the author agreeing to take the child to a farm with a friend, and the partner gets upset, wanting to cancel so he can go another day. The author rejected that, saying if they can't go when the partner is working, then maybe they can wait for another time. The cost here is \u00a37 per person, which the partner also brought up as an excuse before but the author considers it minor.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the shared responsibility of parenting and the partner's reactions. The author is trying to do something for the child's benefit, which is understandable. However, the partner feels left out or that the author is overstepping by going without him, even though they've had previous discussions where the partner declined similar outings. \n\nIn many cases, parents might alternate taking the kids to activities, especially if both are working. But if the partner has consistently refused these outings in the past with various excuses, the author might feel the need to step in to ensure the child gets to enjoy these activities. However, the partner's current reaction suggests a feeling of being excluded or possibly not consulted. The author did mention the plan to the partner, but the partner's response was to get upset and ask to cancel so he can go instead. The author's response was to push back, indicating they were already given excuses before. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the activity is for the child's benefit, and the partner had previously refused multiple times. The author is fulfilling their role as a parent by providing the child with a fun experience when the other parent is unavailable. The partner's issue might be more about not being included rather than the outing itself. But the author did inform them, so the partner had a chance to object. The main problem seems to be the partner's inconsistency in excuses and the author's proactive step. So the answer should be B.\n"
