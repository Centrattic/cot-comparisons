Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple with a 3-year-old child. The main issue is about taking the kid out for fun activities when the partner is at work.\n\nSo, the author mentions that every weekend they want to take the child to places like a play center or farm, but the partner usually comes up with excuses. The partner says they don't want to go out, are tired, or don't want to spend money. The author then decided to go to a farm with a friend, which the partner found unfair because he was working. The partner wants them to cancel so he can join later, but the author is resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is trying to take the child out for fun, which is a common parental responsibility. The partner's excuses seem to be about personal preference rather than necessity. The cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which isn't much, so money isn't a real issue. The partner's reaction is about fairness because he's working, but the author points out that they often have the same issue when trying to go out together.\n\nI should think about shared responsibilities in parenting. Both parents should contribute to the child's activities. If one parent is consistently not interested in participating, maybe the other parent can't be blamed for taking the child alone sometimes. The author isn't going for something selfish like a movie; it's a children's petting zoo, which is appropriate for the kid. The partner's claim that it's unfair because he's working might be a bit self-centered, as the child's needs and the parent's initiative to provide enrichment are important.\n\nAlso, the fact that the partner offered excuses before and now is upset because the author went ahead without him suggests inconsistency. The author isn't ignoring the partner's feelings entirely, as they offered to go whenever the partner wants. The main conflict seems to be about the partner's unwillingness to participate and then feeling left out when the other parent does something without him.\n\nIn such situations, it's important for both parents to communicate and find a balance. However, the author isn't doing anything wrong by taking the child out when the partner isn't available or interested. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not considered, but the author is prioritizing the child's well-being and their own initiative to have fun with them. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
