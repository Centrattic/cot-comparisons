Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author took their 3-year-old out to a farm while their partner was at work. The partner gets upset because they feel left out or that they should be the one to take the kids out. The author argues that the partner has consistently refused to go out due to being tired, not wanting to spend money, or other excuses.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants to take their child out for fun, which is a common parental need. They tried before but the partner didn't want to go. Now they made a plan without the partner. The partner is upset because they feel it's unfair since they're at work and want to go. The author points out that they've been refused multiple times before with similar excuses.\n\nThe key points here are shared responsibilities in parenting, communication, and fairness. The author might feel that they need to provide activities for their child even if the partner isn't available. The partner might feel excluded or that their input isn't considered. However, the partner's previous refusals were consistent, so maybe the author is trying to fulfill their role as a parent despite the partner's reluctance.\n\nThe author mentioned that the partner's excuses aren't valid because they have money, and the cost is manageable. Also, the activity is child-focused, not something like a movie. The partner is upset because they weren't included, but the author is acting on their own initiative when the partner isn't available.\n\nIn many relationships, parents need to take turns or make decisions when the other is unavailable. The author isn't excluding the partner from the child's life; they're just taking responsibility when the partner is busy. The partner might need to communicate their feelings better or find their own time to do activities with the child. The author's action seems reasonable given the partner's past behavior. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to provide for their child's needs, and the partner's reaction might be more about feeling left out than the activity itself.\n"
