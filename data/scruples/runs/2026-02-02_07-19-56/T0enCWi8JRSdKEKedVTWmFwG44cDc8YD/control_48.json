Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parent (the author) wants to take their child to a play center or farm on weekends. The partner usually refuses with excuses like being tired, not wanting to go out, or not wanting to spend money. The author mentions that money isn't an issue, so the cost isn't a real obstacle. \n\nNow, the author decided to go with a friend to a farm when the partner is working. The partner got upset and wants the author to cancel so he can go. The author argues that they've asked before and been refused, so taking the child without the partner isn't wrong. The cost is \u00a37 each, which isn't much.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about shared responsibilities in parenting and the partner's reaction. The author is taking the initiative to spend time with the child when the partner is unavailable. The partner seems to be upset about not being included, even though he's been the one declining before. \n\nThe author is pointing out that the partner has been the one to say no in the past, so why is it a problem now when the author takes the child? The partner might feel left out or that the author is making decisions without consulting him, but the author did mention the plan and then the partner reacted negatively. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it depends on whether the author had the right to make the decision when the partner is working. Since the partner had previously refused, maybe the author is justified in taking the child without them. Also, the activity is a children's petting zoo, which isn't a big deal. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems a bit over the top. The author isn't excluding the partner on purpose but is trying to provide an activity for the child when the partner isn't available. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
