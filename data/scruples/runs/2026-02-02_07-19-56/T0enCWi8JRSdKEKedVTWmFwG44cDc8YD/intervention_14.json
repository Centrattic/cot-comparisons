Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a children's petting zoo without their partner, who was at work. The partner had previously given excuses about not wanting to go out or being tired, and when the author made plans without them, the partner got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that the partner almost always refuses to go out on weekends, giving similar excuses each time. The author felt the child needed some fun activity, so they agreed to go with a friend. The partner then expressed that it's unfair because he's at work and wanted to go. The author points out that the partner had previously refused, so the author decided to go without him. Now the partner wants to cancel the plans so he can go instead, but the author is refusing.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overstepped by making plans without the partner. On one hand, the partner has been refusing to participate in these activities, so maybe the author is just stepping in to ensure the child has something to do. On the other hand, the partner might feel excluded or not consulted, even if he's been the one saying no before.\n\nI need to think about the fairness in the situation. If the partner consistently refuses to go out, the author might feel they have to take initiative. However, making plans without discussing them again could lead to the partner feeling ignored. But the author had already asked before and was turned down, so this time they decided to go without. The partner's reaction seems to be about not wanting to miss out now that plans are made. \n\nThe cost is mentioned as \u00a37 each, which isn't much, so it's not a financial issue. The partner's reasons for not going before were tiredness and not wanting to. The author's action seems reasonable because they're prioritizing the child's needs based on the partner's past behavior. The partner's current reaction might be more about feeling excluded rather than the child's needs. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have discussed the plan again, but since the partner had always said no before, the author might have felt justified. The partner's insistence on canceling the plans now that they're made seems contradictory. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They're following through with a plan to benefit the child, based on the partner's previous refusals.\n"
