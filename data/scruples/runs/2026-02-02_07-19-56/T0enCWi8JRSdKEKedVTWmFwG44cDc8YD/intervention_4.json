Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a partner taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the other partner is at work. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer mentions that almost every weekend they suggest taking the kid to a play center or farm, but the partner comes up with excuses like being tired, not wanting to go out, or not wanting to spend money. The writer then made plans with a friend to go to a farm, and when they told the partner, he got upset because he felt it wasn't fair since he was at work. The writer pointed out previous refusals and the cost isn't an issue. Now the partner wants them to cancel, but the writer refuses.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want my take. So I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the partner who is working might feel left out or think that the other should wait until they can join. But on the other hand, the parent making the plans has tried multiple times before and faced excuses. They're trying to provide a fun experience for the child, which is reasonable. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The partner's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or perhaps resentful of the previous refusals.\n\nThe parent taking the child out when the other is working isn't inherently wrong. Parents often need to make decisions when the other is unavailable. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling that their input isn't considered, but the writer didn't cancel the plans when the partner was available. The writer also offered flexibility (\"we can go whenever you want\"), which the partner didn't accept. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether it's fair for the partner to object to the writer taking the child out while he's working, especially after multiple refusals. The writer isn't doing anything harmful; they're providing a positive experience for the child. The partner's anger might be more about feeling excluded than the actual activity itself. Therefore, the writer isn't in the wrong for making plans, especially since they've faced consistent excuses before and the partner didn't join when available.\n"
