Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a farm while the partner is at work. The user provided a detailed scenario.\n\nFirst, the partner often refuses to join because they're tired, don't want to go out, or don't want to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author decided to take the kid without the partner this time. The partner got upset about not being included. The author argues that the previous refusals were reasons enough to go without them. \n\nI need to consider if the author's decision is justified. The partner's excuses seem to be consistent, and the author made a choice to do something fun for the child. The cost is low (\u00a37 each), and the outing is kid-friendly. The partner's reaction might be about feeling left out, but the author's actions were to provide an activity they had been avoiding. \n\nKey points: The author is trying to provide for the child's enjoyment despite the partner's previous refusals. The partner's reaction seems more about exclusion rather than a valid reason. The author isn't doing something that requires the partner's presence. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're making a decision to do something positive for their child when the partner has repeatedly not wanted to participate. The partner should accept that the author can make independent decisions for the child's benefit.\n"
