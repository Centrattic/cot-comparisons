Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work. The user is asking for opinions on whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author mentions that almost every weekend they want to take the kid to places like a play center or a farm. The partner consistently gives excuses: not wanting to go out, being tired, not wanting to spend money. The user points out that money isn't a problem. This has been happening regularly.\n\nThen, the author's friend invites them to a farm, so they agree. They mention it to their partner, who gets upset because he's at work and wants to go instead. The author responds by pointing out that they've been told no before with similar excuses. They refuse to cancel, and the partner is still upset.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but is that the case? Let's consider a few angles.\n\nFirst, parenting responsibilities. Both parents should share the responsibility of taking care of their child. If one parent is consistently not interested in activities, maybe the other should step in. The partner's excuses seem dismissive\u2014maybe they're not taking their role in parenting seriously. The author is trying to provide a fun experience for the child, which is a valid reason.\n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. The author made plans with a friend and didn't wait for the partner to be available. But the partner might feel left out or not involved in the child's activities. On the other hand, the partner's excuses (like being tired or not wanting to spend money) might be valid, but they've been recurring. If the partner is always declining, maybe the author is justified in taking initiative.\n\nMoney isn't an issue here, so the cost of \u00a37 per person isn't a real problem. The partner's complaint seems more about being excluded rather than the expense. The author's actions might be seen as prioritizing the child's needs over the partner's availability. But the partner might feel that the author isn't considering their input. \n\nBut the key point is that the partner has a history of not wanting to go out, so the author is filling the gap. It's reasonable for the author to take the child to an activity when the other parent isn't available. The author isn't doing something wrong by providing for their child's happiness. The partner's reaction seems more about feeling overlooked than about the actual activity. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance individual needs with the child's needs. If the partner isn't participating, the author is doing the right thing. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
