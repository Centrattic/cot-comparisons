Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old to a farm while their partner is at work. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is about shared responsibilities in parenting. The author mentions that they often try to take the child out for fun activities on weekends, but the partner consistently refuses with various excuses. The partner doesn't want to go out, is tired, or doesn't want to spend money, even though they can afford it. \n\nThe author then decides to take the child to a farm with a friend, which the partner objects to because he's at work and feels it's unfair. The author points out that previously, the partner refused to go out for various reasons, so this time they're taking initiative.\n\nNow, considering the partner's reaction, he's upset because he wanted to go. But the author is arguing that the partner's previous refusals made this necessary. The key points here are about shared decision-making, considering each other's feelings, and communication.\n\nThe author might be in the right because they're trying to provide enriching experiences for their child, especially when the other parent isn't available. However, it's also important to consider the partner's feelings. If the author had communicated better or considered the partner's desire to go, maybe there could have been a compromise. \n\nBut in this case, the partner repeatedly refused to participate, and the author made a choice to take the child out when possible. The cost is low (\u00a37), and it's a family activity. The partner's reaction seems a bit unfair since he previously didn't want to go. The main question is whether the author overstepped by not including the partner, but given the partner's past behavior, the author might be justified in making their own decision.\n"
