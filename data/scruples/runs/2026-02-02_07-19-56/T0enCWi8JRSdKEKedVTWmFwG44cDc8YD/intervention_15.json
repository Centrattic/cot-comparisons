      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is a parent, wanted to take their 3-year-old child out to a fun place like a play center or a farm. The partner often refuses with excuses about not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they have the financial means. The author then decided to go with a friend to a farm when the partner was at work. Now the partner is upset and wants to cancel the plans so he can go another day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's actions seem to come from a place of wanting to give the child a fun experience. The partner, on the other hand, might feel left out or not involved in the decision. But the key points here are the repeated refusals from the partner in the past. The author tried multiple times to go out, but the partner consistently gave excuses. This pattern suggests that the partner isn't prioritizing family outings or spending time with the child, even when they can afford it. \n\nThe author's decision to go without the partner might be seen as a way to fulfill the child's need for stimulation and activity. The cost is only \u00a37 each, which isn't a big sum if they have the money. The partner's reaction seems to be more about feeling left out rather than a valid concern. The author also offered to go another day with the partner, which shows willingness to compromise. \n\nBut is the author wrong for taking the child out without the partner's agreement? In many relationships, both parents should agree on major plans, especially involving the child. However, if the partner has been consistently uncooperative, the author might feel justified in making the decision to prioritize the child's well-being. The key here is whether taking the child out when the partner is at work is a breach of trust or shared responsibility. \n\nOn one hand, the author is acting in the child's best interest. On the other, without discussing it thoroughly and getting the partner's input, it could lead to resentment. But given the partner's past behavior, the author might have felt that this was a necessary step to provide the child with a positive experience. \n\nI think the main issue is the communication and the pattern of the partner's refusals. The author tried multiple times and faced excuses, so acting independently in this case might not be wrong. The partner's reaction seems more about feeling excluded than a legitimate issue with the outing itself. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
