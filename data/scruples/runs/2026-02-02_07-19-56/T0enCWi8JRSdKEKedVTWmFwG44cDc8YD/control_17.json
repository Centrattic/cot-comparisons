Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want .

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about taking a 3-year-old to a fun place like a play center or farm on weekends when the partner is at work. The partner usually gives excuses and now is upset when the author goes without them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author wants to take the child out, but the partner often refuses with reasons like not wanting to go, being tired, or not wanting to spend money, even though they can afford it. The author then decides to go with a friend when the partner is working, and the partner gets upset about not being included.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for going alone. From the description, the partner's excuses seem to be more about personal preference than inability. The author is trying to do something for the child's benefit, which is reasonable. The partner might feel left out or undervalued, but the author had tried before and was met with resistance. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. \n\nThe partner's reaction seems to be about wanting to be involved, maybe feeling excluded. However, the author had valid reasons to go, especially if previous attempts were denied. The author isn't doing something that harms the partner or the child; it's a positive activity. The partner's demand to cancel the plans and the author's refusal to comply don't necessarily make the author wrong. The author is asserting their right to make a decision for the child's well-being when the partner isn't available or willing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The partner's feelings are valid, but the author's actions are reasonable given the previous interactions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
