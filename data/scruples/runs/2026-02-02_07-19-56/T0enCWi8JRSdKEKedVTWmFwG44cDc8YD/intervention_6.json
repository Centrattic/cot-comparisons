Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the author is taking their 3-year-old out for fun activities on weekends while the partner is at work. The partner often refuses to join, giving excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then decides to go on their own with a friend to a farm, which the partner objects to because he feels it's unfair since he's working. The author points out that they tried to go before but the partner said no.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is trying to spend quality time with their child, which is important. The partner consistently refuses to participate in these outings, using various excuses. Now, the author goes on their own, and the partner is upset, asking to cancel to go another day. The author refuses, saying they can go whenever the partner wants.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable because they're trying to engage with their child when the partner isn't available. However, maybe the partner feels overlooked or that the author is making decisions without consulting them. On the other hand, the author did mention the plan and faced a negative reaction. The partner's behavior of constantly refusing might indicate a lack of willingness to participate, which could be an issue.\n\nI should consider if taking the child out on their own is a legitimate choice, especially since the partner has shown disinterest. The cost is minimal (\u00a37 each), so money isn't a real issue. The author is fulfilling their role as a parent by providing activities for the child. The partner's reaction might stem from feeling excluded or not being involved. However, the author isn't going without the partner's consent; they're making a choice when the partner isn't available.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't doing anything wrong by taking the child out on their own, especially since the partner has consistently refused. The partner might need to address their own issues with not wanting to participate. The author's response to the partner's complaint is valid because they've already been denied previously. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
