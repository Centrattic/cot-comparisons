Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work. The partner is upset because they can't go along and are asking the author to cancel the plans.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that whenever they suggest going out for something fun with the kid, the partner gives excuses like being tired, not wanting to go, or not wanting to spend money. The author feels like they're the only one interested in these outings. This seems like a recurring issue where the partner isn't engaging in family activities. \n\nThe author then agrees to take the kid to a farm with a friend, which is a planned event. The partner reacts negatively, wanting to cancel so he can go instead. The author is questioning whether they did something wrong by going ahead with the plans when the partner was working.\n\nI think the key points here are about shared responsibility in parenting and communication. If the partner consistently refuses to participate in these outings, the author is just trying to give the child an enjoyable experience. The cost is low (\u00a37 each), so money isn't really an issue. The partner's reaction seems more about not wanting to miss out rather than the child's needs. \n\nThe author isn't excluding the partner on purpose; they're just filling in when the partner isn't available. The parent is trying to provide a good experience for the child, and the partner's frustration might stem from not wanting to be left out. However, it's the parent's responsibility to make these decisions when the other parent isn't available. The author isn't at fault here because they're acting in the child's best interest and the partner has been uncooperative in the past. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
