Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah . I said so I cant take her anywhere when you're at work ? Pointed out that I asked to go not a week or two earlier and was told no its too expencive and  I dont want to go out I'm tired. ( its \u00a37 each ). \n\nSo now he wants me to cancle with my friend so he can go another day . I said we can go whenever you want . But apparently thats not an option either . \n\nIts a childrens petting zoo ffs its not like im going to see a movie wothout him. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for taking their 3-year-old out to a fun activity while their partner is at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: The partner repeatedly refuses to go out on weekends, giving excuses like not wanting to go out, being tired, or not wanting to spend money. The author then decides to take their child to a farm with a friend when their partner is working. The partner gets upset and wants them to cancel. The author argues that the partner had previously given similar excuses and that it's a kids' petting zoo, not a movie.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about shared responsibilities and communication. The partner is working, but the author is taking initiative to spend time with their child. The partner's constant refusals might mean the author is trying to fulfill their parent role when the other can't. The cost is trivial (\u00a37 each), so money isn't an issue. The author isn't going without the partner for a date; it's a child-centered activity. The partner's reaction seems a bit harsh, expecting the author to always wait for them to be available. The author is taking action to benefit the child, which is reasonable. The partner could have gone another day, but the author isn't obligated to wait for their availability every time. So, probably the author is in the right here. Answer B.\n"
