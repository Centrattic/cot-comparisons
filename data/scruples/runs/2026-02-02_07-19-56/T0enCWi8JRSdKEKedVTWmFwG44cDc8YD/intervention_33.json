Either \"I dont want to go out / I just wanna sit and play on the computer. \" \" ive been at work im tired I don't wanna go out / drive \" or \" I don't wanna spend the money on x, y ,z\" ( we have money so its not like thats a real problem )   \n\nToday a friend asked me if i wanted to go with her with the kids to the farm near us tomorrow and I said yes . I figured since we hadn't taken little one anywhere fun for a few weeks it would be nice . \n\nSo I mentioned it to my partner and he goes off on one about how its not fair as he is at work and he would like to go blah blah .

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves taking their 3-year-old to a fun activity while the partner is at work. The partner has been giving excuses before, and now the author went ahead without the partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that the partner often refuses to go out with reasons like being tired, not wanting to, or cost issues, even though they can afford it. The author then takes the child to an event with a friend, which the partner objects to because he's working and wants to go. The author argues that they've been denied before and that the activity isn't expensive.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel they're doing what's best for the child and the partner's excuses are not valid. The partner, on the other hand, might feel left out or that the author isn't considering his wishes. The key points here are communication, shared responsibilities, and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author took initiative to ensure the child has fun, which is understandable. However, maybe they should have discussed the plans more thoroughly with the partner. Even if the partner was making excuses before, the author might have expected the partner to be supportive now. But the author also points out that the partner's objections seem inconsistent\u2014previously not wanting to go, now wanting to go when they can't. The cost is low (\u00a37 each), so that's not a valid excuse. The activity is a petting zoo, which is child-focused, so the parent's absence isn't a big issue compared to, say, a movie date. \n\nThe partner's reaction could be about feeling excluded or not being considered. The author's response was to point out past excuses, which might have come off as dismissive. Maybe the author should have acknowledged the partner's feelings while still going ahead with the plan. Alternatively, the partner might need to be more flexible. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't doing anything harmful. They're ensuring the child's happiness and the activity is suitable. The partner's main issue is about fairness, but if they weren't willing to participate before, their current objection might be less about fairness and more about wanting to have their way now. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to provide for the child's enjoyment despite the partner's previous refusals. The partner might need to adjust their expectations and communicate better. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
