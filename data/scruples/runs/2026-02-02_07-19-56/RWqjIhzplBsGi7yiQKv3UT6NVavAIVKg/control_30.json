The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The wife is pregnant with the third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The parents came over, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author said they'd come down at 3 to let everyone nap. The parents were upset and left because they felt they were treated rudely. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife, who's not sleeping much due to pregnancy and the twins. The parents were told to let themselves in, which the author did. The parents expected to be greeted immediately upon arrival, but the author gave them time to nap. The key points here are communication and expectations.\n\nThe author communicated that they'd be down at 3, which gave the parents an hour to themselves. However, maybe the parents expected to be greeted right away. The author's intention was to help the family rest, which is understandable, especially with three kids. But the parents felt ignored or disrespected. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he did communicate the time they'd come down, so it's not like he didn't set an expectation. However, maybe the parents were expecting to be acknowledged when they arrived. If the author had checked in with the parents after they arrived, even briefly, that might have diffused the situation. But the parents had been told to let themselves in, so perhaps they felt that meant they could just stay and do their own thing. The author's main fault might be not considering that the parents might have wanted more interaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to take care of his wife's needs during a tough time. The parents might have overreacted, but their feelings are valid in that they wanted to be greeted. The wife's upset feelings also add to the guilt-trip aspect. The author might be in the right because he communicated and prioritized his family's needs, but maybe also did a poor job of managing the parents' expectations. However, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since he did communicate the time and didn't ignore the parents entirely, it might be that he's not in the wrong. But if the parents expected immediate greeting, then the author might have failed to adjust for their expectations. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author had valid reasons and communicated, but there's a nuance here. However, in AITA scenarios, sometimes the outcome of hurting others' feelings can tip the balance. But given the circumstances, B might be the better answer.\n"
