My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so the whole family ended up in bed watching a movie, and everyone fell asleep. The author's parents were coming over in the afternoon, so he texted them to let themselves in and eat. When the parents arrived at 2:30, the author told them they'd come down at 3 PM to allow the family some rest. However, the parents were upset and left, feeling ignored. The wife is also upset, blaming herself for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is dealing with young children, a pregnant wife, and likely sleep deprivation. The author's intention was to let everyone rest, especially the wife, who isn't sleeping much. The parents, on the other hand, expected to be greeted upon arrival, which is a common social norm. The author's decision not to wake them might have been based on their own family's needs, but it's possible they didn't consider how the parents would feel about not being acknowledged.\n\nOn one hand, the author prioritized their family's well-being, which is understandable. On the other hand, not informing the parents about the delay and not greeting them might have been a social faux pas. Even if the author had a good reason, communication could have been better. Maybe a call or a more detailed message explaining the situation would have helped the parents understand and set expectations.\n\nThe parents' reaction is a key point here. They felt ignored, which led to them leaving upset. The author's wife also felt guilty for being asleep, adding emotional stress. The author's text message to the parents was brief, perhaps not conveying the full situation. Maybe the parents felt disrespected because they weren't asked if they could wait or if they preferred to leave. Different families have different expectations, but in many cases, guests might expect to be greeted, especially if they've traveled or made an effort to visit.\n\nHowever, the author's actions were based on trying to support their pregnant wife and overtired children. It's a common challenge with young kids and pregnancy. The question is whether the author acted inconsiderately or if they had a valid reason. Since the author did inform the parents in advance and gave a time frame, but the parents still felt upset, it's possible the author isn't entirely at fault. But maybe there's a middle ground where both the family's needs and the parents' expectations could have been balanced better.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, guests often appreciate some flexibility, but being completely ignored can be hurtful. The author could have called the parents when they arrived to explain the situation in real-time, allowing the parents to decide if they wanted to wait or come back later. Texting might have been insufficient for conveying empathy and urgency.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they were trying to take care of their family's needs. However, there's room for improvement in communication. The answer would depend on whether the author's actions were seen as neglecting the parents' social expectations or if the family's circumstances justified the delay.\n"
