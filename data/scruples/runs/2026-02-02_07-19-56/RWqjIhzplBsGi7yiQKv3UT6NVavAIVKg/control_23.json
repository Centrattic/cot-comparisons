The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents came over, the author told them to let themselves in and wait, and then they got upset when the family took a nap and didn't come down until an hour later. The parents left because they felt ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with baby number three, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed together watching a movie and fell asleep. The author texted his parents to come over, told them to let themselves in, and said they'd come down in an hour. The parents were there for half an hour and then the family came down. The parents were upset about not being greeted and left.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning was to let his wife get more sleep since she's not sleeping well. That makes sense because pregnancy can be tiring, especially with two young kids. The author wanted to maximize her rest. But the parents felt that waiting for an hour without being acknowledged or greeted was rude. They might have expected a more immediate response or at least some communication during the waiting time.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be considerate to his wife and kids by letting them rest. On the other hand, the parents might feel that their presence was important and that being kept waiting without any explanation was unkind. The parents might have expected a greeting upon arrival, even if the family wasn't ready to come down. Maybe there's a cultural expectation here about guests being greeted promptly.\n\nAlso, the wife is upset because she blames herself for being asleep. That adds emotional weight to the situation. The author's intention was good, but the outcome caused hurt feelings. The parents left, which suggests that the author's actions might have been perceived as disrespectful, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Perhaps the author could have communicated better. For example, when the parents arrived, maybe a quick text to say they're still resting but will come down soon. Or maybe the author could have asked the parents to wait a bit but check in with them to see if they needed anything. But the author just told them to let themselves in and make themselves at home. Maybe the parents felt ignored because there was no follow-up.\n\nIn some cultures, expecting guests to wait without any acknowledgment is considered rude. Even if the author had a valid reason, not maintaining communication might have made the parents feel unimportant. The parents might have expected a more immediate greeting, even if the family wasn't ready to join them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the parents' perspective. While his intention was to help his wife, he didn't account for the parents' expectations and feelings. The solution might have been to communicate better, not just let them wait without any contact. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
