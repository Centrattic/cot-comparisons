The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins. The twins didn't nap, so the whole family ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, telling them they'd come down at 3, which would give the wife and kids about an hour and a half of sleep. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited until 3, and then got upset that they weren't greeted, leading to them leaving. The wife feels bad for being asleep.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author was trying to accommodate his family's need for rest, especially with a pregnant wife and young kids. It's understandable that they needed sleep. He communicated with the parents beforehand, setting an expectation that they'd come down at 3. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents arrived and had to wait. They might have expected a greeting or at least a sign that they were welcome. The parents being upset could be because they felt ignored or unappreciated. The author didn't check in with them after they arrived, just let them in and expected them to wait. Maybe the parents felt disrespected by not being greeted, even if they were told to make themselves at home.\n\nAlso, the wife blaming herself suggests that the parents' reaction affected the family dynamic. The parents leaving might have been hurtful. The author's intention was good, but maybe he should have considered the parents' feelings more. Even if he thought the parents were okay with waiting, expecting a half-hour wait without a greeting might have been too much. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone comes over, especially family, it's customary to greet them. The author might have assumed they'd be okay, but not everyone handles waiting that way. The parents might have felt it was rude not to come down when they arrived. So even if the author's reasoning was based on family needs, the execution might have been lacking. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider the parents' perspective adequately. While the situation was challenging, not greeting them immediately could be seen as inconsiderate, despite the good intentions. The answer would be A.\n"
