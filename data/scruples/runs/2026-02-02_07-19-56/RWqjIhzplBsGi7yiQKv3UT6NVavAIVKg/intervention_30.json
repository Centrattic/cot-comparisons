The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is at fault for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation involves a very pregnant wife, twins who refused to nap, and the parents coming over. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, planning to come down later when everyone had napped. The parents felt ignored and left in a huff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with her third child and already has twins. The twins didn't nap, so they were all in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The author's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife and kids. That makes sense because a pregnant woman needs rest, and toddlers' naps are important. The parents arrived, and the author wanted to let the family rest, assuming the in-laws could wait half an hour. But the parents were upset they weren't greeted immediately.\n\nNow, why might the author be in the wrong? Maybe because the parents arrived and expected to be greeted. Even if the author texted them to let themselves in, maybe not acknowledging their arrival in real-time was dismissive. The parents might have felt ignored or not respected. Also, the wife blamed herself for sleeping, which could indicate that the author didn't consider how his parents' expectations might affect her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to take care of his family's needs. The wife is in a vulnerable state, and the kids needed rest. The parents were told to make themselves at home, so maybe expecting them to wait 30 minutes is reasonable. But maybe the parents didn't realize the situation was urgent or that the family was exhausted. The key here is whether the author's action of not waking them up was considerate enough towards the parents' feelings.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author texted them when they arrived, said they'd come down in 30 minutes. But maybe the parents wanted to be greeted in person. Texting isn't the same as a phone call or knocking on the door to check in. The parents might have felt that the author was avoiding meeting them, hence the feeling of rudeness.\n\nBut then again, the author did inform them they could eat and make themselves comfortable. The parents might have been expecting more proactive interaction. It's a balance between respecting the family's need for rest and the expectations of the guests. In some cultures, guests might expect immediate attention, while others are more flexible. The author's decision might be seen as self-centered if the parents felt slighted, but as a necessary act of self-care in a stressful time.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the delay was communicated properly and if there was an expectation of immediate attention. The author tried to explain, but the parents were upset. The wife's reaction also shows that the author didn't fully anticipate how this would affect her. Maybe a middle ground would be to check in with the parents after they arrived to confirm the plan, rather than just texting. But the author did inform them, so maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the parents' feelings were hurt, and the author could have considered their perspective more. I'm leaning towards the author being in the right because he was prioritizing his family's health, but some might argue he should have made more effort to meet the parents. Hmm.\n"
