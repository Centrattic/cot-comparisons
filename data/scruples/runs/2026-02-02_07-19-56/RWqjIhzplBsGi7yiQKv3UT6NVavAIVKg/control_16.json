The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents arrived, leading to the parents being upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant, and they have twins who didn't nap. So the family was all asleep on the bed. The parents were coming over in the afternoon, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat whenever. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd come down at 3. The reasoning was to let the wife get more rest since she's not sleeping well. The parents were upset about not being greeted immediately and left.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respecting boundaries and communication. The author tried to manage their family's rest time, which is understandable, especially with a third child on the way and twins. However, the parents felt ignored or disrespected because they weren't acknowledged upon arrival. \n\nI should think about whether the author's actions were reasonable. They did notify the parents ahead of time that they might be asleep and to let themselves in. The parents arrived a bit earlier than expected, perhaps? But the author gave them an hour to wait. Maybe the parents expected to be greeted right away. The author's intention was to let the family rest, which is a valid need. However, not checking in with the parents during that hour might have been an oversight. Maybe a quick call or text to let them know they were still asleep could have eased the parents' feelings. \n\nAlso, the wife blaming herself adds to the emotional weight. The parents might have felt slighted, but given the circumstances of the family's exhaustion, the author's priority was understandable. However, the way it was handled\u2014no communication for an hour\u2014might have been too much for the parents. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about perspective. The author's side is about family rest, while the parents' side is about respect and being acknowledged. The author might not be in the wrong if they communicated their intentions clearly, but maybe they could have done better. However, in this case, the parents were told ahead of time to let themselves in, so the author might not be entirely at fault. But the fact that the parents were left waiting without any interaction might tip the balance. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they did communicate the plan and prioritized their family's health, especially with a pregnant wife and young children. The parents should have understood the context, but maybe they didn't. Still, the author made a reasonable decision based on their circumstances.\n"
