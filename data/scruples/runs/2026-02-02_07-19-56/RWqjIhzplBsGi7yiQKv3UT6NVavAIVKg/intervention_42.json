My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever.

My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins refused to nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat whatever. The parents arrived at 2:30 PM, and the author told them they'd be down by 3 PM, giving his wife and kids time to nap. However, the parents were upset and left, feeling it was rude not to greet them immediately. The wife also felt bad about being asleep.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong in letting them sleep instead of waking them up. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that his wife is sleep-deprived, and they wanted to maximize rest. He thought allowing an extra hour for naps was considerate. However, the parents felt snubbed because they were there and expected a greeting. The parents left upset, and the wife blamed herself.\n\nFactors to consider: The parents might have expected some acknowledgment, even if the family was sleeping. But the author had communicated in advance that they should let themselves in, which might imply that the family wasn't expecting immediate attention. However, when the parents arrived, they might have hoped for a welcome, especially in person.\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In some cultures, showing up and being greeted is expected, regardless of the circumstances. Others might be more understanding of the host's situation. The key is whether the author was unreasonable in prioritizing rest over greeting his parents.\n\nThe parents might have felt disrespected because they arrived and weren't even greeted. Even though the author had given a heads-up, the delay in meeting them could have made them feel unwelcome. On the other hand, the author had a valid reason related to family needs. But perhaps there's a middle ground, like sending a message to let the parents know they were still asleep and would be down soon, instead of not acknowledging their arrival at all.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a point. She felt bad for sleeping, which might indicate that she wanted to be there for her in-laws but couldn't. The author might have considered that and assured her it's okay, but the parents' upset reaction added to the tension.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a choice to let everyone sleep, which is understandable. However, the way it was handled might have been better with some communication. Instead of just letting the parents in without a greeting, maybe the author could have sent a quick message to confirm the arrival and explain the delay, which might have softened the parents' reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents felt that not being greeted at all was rude, then the author might share some responsibility. However, if the author communicated the plan in advance and the parents still chose to be upset, maybe it's a misunderstanding. The key is whether the author's action was unreasonable. Prioritizing family rest during a difficult time (pregnancy and twins) could be seen as reasonable. However, the lack of communication upon arrival might have contributed to the parents' upset.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because he had a valid reason and communicated in advance. However, he could have improved by informing the parents upon their arrival that the family was still napping but would be down soon. This would have shown respect to both the family's needs and the parents' visit. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the parents ended up upset and left, maybe the author should have found a way to bridge the communication gap. Therefore, he might be partly at fault, but not entirely. However, according to the user's question, the answer should be A or B. I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
