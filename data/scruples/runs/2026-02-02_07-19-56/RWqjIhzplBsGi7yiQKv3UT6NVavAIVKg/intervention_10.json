The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The author sent a text to his parents to let themselves in and eat, then told them they'd come down in an hour. The parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant, and the twins didn't nap. They were all in bed, and the author wanted them to rest. The parents arrived at 2:30 PM, and the author told them to wait until 3:30. The parents felt disrespected and left. The wife also felt bad because she was asleep.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the parents are family, and they were expecting to be greeted. The author's intention was to let his family rest, which is understandable, especially with a pregnant wife and young children. However, the parents might have felt ignored or not respected because they were left alone without a greeting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did communicate the plan to the parents, telling them they'd come down in an hour. The parents might have taken it as being snubbed if they had to wait without being informed. Maybe the author could have had a family member greet them briefly or at least check in while the rest rested. But the parents were upset, even after the explanation. \n\nThe wife blamed herself, which adds to the emotional impact. So, maybe the author should have considered the parents' feelings more. Even if the intention was good, the parents might need more attention. But the situation is complex with a lot of stress from the children and the pregnancy. \n\nI think the answer isn't straightforward. The author's actions were for the family's well-being, but the parents' feelings were hurt. Depending on cultural expectations or how the parents perceived the situation, the author might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the circumstances are challenging. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is AITA. Given that the parents left and were upset, the author might be partially at fault for not finding a middle ground, like greeting them briefly or explaining the situation earlier. However, the author's reasoning is valid. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because the intention was to help the family rest, and they communicated the plan. But the parents' reaction might be a problem. Alternatively, maybe the author should have handled it differently. I'm a bit torn. \n\nBut considering the parents were left alone and then left upset, the author might be seen as not considering their feelings enough. So maybe A. Wait, but the answer should be A or B. Given the context, perhaps the author is not in the wrong (B) because the situation is difficult and their intention was to help the family rest. However, others might argue they should have made an effort to greet the parents. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to prioritize their family's health, and they communicated the plan. The parents might have overreacted, but the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
