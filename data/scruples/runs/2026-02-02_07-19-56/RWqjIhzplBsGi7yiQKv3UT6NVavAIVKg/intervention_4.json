The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, and when they arrived at 2:30, he told them they'd come down at 3. The parents were upset they weren't greeted and left. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and family expectations. In some families, guests are expected to be greeted promptly when they arrive. The author might have prioritized rest for his family, which is understandable given the wife's pregnancy and the twins' lack of nap. But did he consider the parents' feelings? The parents might have felt disrespected or ignored, especially if they were used to being greeted immediately. \n\nThe author's reasoning was to maximize rest for the wife and kids, which is a valid concern. However, not informing the parents until they arrived and then not greeting them could come off as rude. Even if they were in a good place to do so, the parents might have felt it's inconsiderate not to check in. \n\nThe wife blaming herself suggests that maybe the author didn't communicate well with her about the plan. Maybe she wasn't on board with the idea of letting the parents wait. Also, the parents were upset, which indicates that their expectations weren't met. The author might have thought it was a small inconvenience, but in reality, it's a social faux pas to leave guests waiting without any communication. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were good, the execution might have been lacking. The parents likely expected a warm welcome, even if it was brief. The author's response to wait an hour without contact could be seen as inconsiderate. The wife's upset also points to the emotional impact of this situation. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the parents' feelings and the social norms around greeting guests. Even with a good reason, the lack of communication and immediate response could be seen as rude. So, answer A.\n"
