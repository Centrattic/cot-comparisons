The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's parents came over, but he didn't wake up his wife and kids to greet them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost 2. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, so the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author said they'd come down at 3, giving the family time to nap. The parents were upset they weren't greeted and left, leading to the wife feeling bad.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the reasons. The author wanted to maximize rest for his wife, who's not sleeping much. The parents came for a visit, but the author prioritized his family's need for rest. Was he wrong to do that?\n\nOn one hand, family visits are important, and the parents might have expected a greeting. However, the situation is that the parents were told to let themselves in and eat. The author gave them a 30-minute buffer, which he thought was enough. The parents might have felt disrespected not being greeted immediately, but the author's intention was to let the family rest. It's a balance between respecting the parents' time and the family's need for rest.\n\nAlso, the wife blamed herself for being asleep, which adds to the problem. The author could have considered informing the parents that they were resting and would come down soon. Maybe a quick message to the parents when they arrived that the family was asleep but would be down shortly. But the author told them they'd be down at 3, so maybe that was sufficient notice. The parents might have felt it was too long a wait. However, the author was trying to be considerate of his wife's health and the kids' needs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. On the one side, prioritizing family rest is valid, especially with a pregnant wife and young kids. On the other, not greeting guests might be seen as rude. But the parents were told to themselves in and eat, so maybe the author's plan was reasonable. The parents' reaction seems harsh, but the author could have perhaps handled the communication better, like checking in again or explaining the situation when they came down. However, the main issue is whether not waking them up was wrong. Considering the circumstances, the author's intentions were good, so maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Sometimes in AITA posts, the answer depends on how the situation is perceived. If the parents were expecting to be greeted and the author didn't do that, it's a point against. But the author did inform them of the time, so it's a bit of a gray area. Probably, the author isn't in the wrong because the situation was genuine and prioritizing family rest is understandable. So answer B.\n"
