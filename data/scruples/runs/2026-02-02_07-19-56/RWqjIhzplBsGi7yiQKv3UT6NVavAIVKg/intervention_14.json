The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation involves a pregnant wife and twins who were all asleep. The parents came over and expected to be greeted, but the author texted them to let themselves in and wait until 3, so the family could nap longer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the intentions. The author wanted to maximize rest for his wife and kids, which is understandable, especially with a third child on the way. He texted his parents to let themselves in, which he's done before. He thought an hour would be enough time for them to wait, maybe even watch TV as usual. But the parents were upset about not being greeted immediately and left angry. The wife felt guilty for being asleep.\n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective, they might have expected a prompt greeting when they arrived. Even if the author had given a time, the parents might have felt disrespected. Cultural norms might play a role here; in some families, immediate hospitality is important. However, the author's decision was to prioritize his family's rest, which is a valid consideration given their circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, not informing the parents properly could be a point of contention. He told them they could let themselves in, but maybe didn't communicate clearly that they should wait until 3. If the parents arrived at 2:30 and expected to be greeted upon arrival, the delay might have caused misunderstandings. The wife being asleep adds to the guilt, but the author's intention was to help her rest.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He made a judgment call based on his family's needs, but perhaps didn't consider how the parents would feel about the delay. The key is communication. If he had made it clearer that they would be down by 3, maybe the parents would have waited. However, since they were upset about not being greeted at all, the author might have been inconsiderate of their expectations. But the intention was good. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer hinges on whether the delay was unreasonable. An hour isn't excessive, and he did plan to meet them then. The parents' reaction might be over the top, but the author's approach could have been more considerate. Maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because failing to greet guests immediately, even if with a reason, can be seen as rude. However, if the communication was clear and they were told to wait, maybe it's B. But since the parents were upset and left, the author's actions led to a negative outcome, so he might be at fault. Alternatively, considering the extenuating circumstances (pregnancy, twins), it's a tough call. I'm leaning towards B because the intention was to help the family rest, and the parents' reaction might be overly sensitive. But I'm not sure.\n"
