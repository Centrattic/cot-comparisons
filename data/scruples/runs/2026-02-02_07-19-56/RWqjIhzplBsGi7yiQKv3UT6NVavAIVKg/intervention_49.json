The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not waking up his family when his parents arrived, leading to his parents feeling upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so the family ended up in bed watching a movie, and everyone fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author told them to let themselves in and texted that they'd come down at 3 PM. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited half an hour, then left upset. The author tried to explain, but his parents were still mad, and his wife felt guilty.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The author's main reasoning was to allow his wife to get much-needed rest because she's pregnant and not sleeping well. The twins also needed sleep. The author texted the parents in advance, which was a heads-up. However, the parents felt ignored or disrespected because they arrived and were not greeted. They expected to be let in immediately or at least acknowledged upon arrival. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, guests usually expect some form of greeting when they arrive. Even though the author had a valid reason (family rest), not informing the parents again when they arrived might have been a miscommunication. The parents were told to let themselves in, but maybe they expected a prompt greeting. The author waited an hour, which might be seen as neglectful by some, especially if the parents were expecting to interact upon arrival. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is understandable. The family was exhausted, and the parents are family who might be more lenient. However, the parents might not have considered the author's circumstances, but the author could have perhaps communicated better. Maybe he should have told the parents to wait in the living room or left a note explaining the situation. Alternatively, he could have tried to wake up his family a bit earlier if time allowed, but if the naps were crucial, that's a different story.\n\nThe wife's upset reaction also plays a role. She might feel responsible for not being up to greet them, adding to her stress. The author's decision not to wake her could have been well-meaning but may have overlooked the parents' expectations.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered polite to greet guests when they arrive, unless there's an unavoidable reason. The author had a reason, but perhaps the delay was too long. The parents might have felt disrespected because they were left alone for 30 minutes without any communication. The author could have compromised by waking up for a few minutes to greet them, even if they were still sleepy.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author prioritized his family's rest over his parents' expectations of immediate greeting. While the intent was to help his family rest, the execution might have been flawed. The parents might not have fully understood the situation, leading to conflict. Therefore, the author might be partially in the wrong, but there are mitigating circumstances. However, given the parents' reaction and the social expectation to greet guests, the author could be seen as at fault for not making better arrangements to balance both needs.\n"
