The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person's wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't take a nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie, and they all fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon. The author texted the parents to let themselves in and eat, saying they'd be down in an hour. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd come down at 3 to let the wife and kids nap. However, the parents were upset that they weren't greeted immediately and left angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are about family dynamics and consideration. The author's reasoning was to let his wife get more rest since she's not sleeping much. He thought the parents could wait an hour, as they often do. But the parents felt disrespected by not being greeted when they arrived. The wife also felt guilty for being asleep.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the situation is challenging with a pregnant wife and young kids. Prioritizing their rest is understandable. On the other hand, the parents might have expected to be greeted when they arrived, even if briefly. The author didn't communicate clearly that they were all napping, maybe leading to the parents feeling ignored. Also, the parents might not have known the urgency of the situation. However, considering the author's explanation, it's a matter of differing expectations. The parents could have waited a bit, but their reaction was harsh. The author wasn't intentionally rude; he was trying to help his family rest. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the parents left upset and the wife blamed herself, maybe the author should have found a middle ground, like waking up briefly to greet them and explain the situation. However, given the stress of the situation, it's debatable. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the intentions were good, and the parents should have been more understanding. But I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe the author should have made an effort to at least check in with the parents upon their arrival. Hmm.\n"
