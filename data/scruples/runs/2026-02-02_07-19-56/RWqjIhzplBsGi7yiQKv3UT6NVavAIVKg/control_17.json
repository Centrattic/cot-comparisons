The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. His wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins wouldn't nap, so they all ended up in bed, and eventually fell asleep. He texted his parents to let themselves in and mentioned they'd come down at 3. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited until 3 when they were greeted, and then were upset, calling the family rude. The wife also felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and not sleeping well, so maximizing her rest makes sense. The twins are young and might not nap consistently. The husband tried to communicate with his parents, telling them when they'd be available. But the parents felt it was rude, which is a social expectation. However, the husband's reasoning is about taking care of his family's well-being, especially the wife's health during pregnancy. \n\nThe key points here are communication and cultural norms. He did inform his parents of the arrival time, so they knew. Maybe the parents expected a greeting upon arrival, but the husband thought waiting a half hour was acceptable. The wife being pregnant adds a layer of needing rest. The parents might have felt ignored, but the husband was trying to balance their needs with his family's needs. \n\nIs it a case of differing expectations? The husband's intention was good, but the outcome made the parents and wife upset. The parents might not have considered the wife's condition. The question is whether not waking them up was wrong. From a practical standpoint, ensuring the wife and kids get rest is important. From a social standpoint, not greeting guests upon arrival can be seen as impolite. But since he communicated the time, maybe it's more about respecting that message. The wife blaming herself suggests she felt guilty, but the husband made the decision to keep them asleep. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents were expecting a greeting immediately, then not waking up could be seen as rude. But the husband had a valid reason. The answer might depend on the parents' sensitivity to the situation. Since the parents were upset and left, maybe the husband should have considered their feelings more. But given the context, he might not be in the wrong. Let me think again. The parents were given a specific time, so the husband wasn't ignoring them, just managing his family's rest. The parents' reaction is harsh, but maybe the husband isn't at fault here. The answer is probably B, No, but I need to be sure.\n"
