The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation is that the wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author said they'd be down at 3, giving the wife three hours of sleep and the twins an hour and a half. But the parents were upset, called them rude, and left. The wife blamed herself for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is dealing with a very young child, twins, and a third pregnancy. That's a lot of stress and sleep deprivation. The author decided to let the family nap for an hour and a half to maximize their rest. The parents expected to be greeted immediately upon arrival, but the author prioritized family rest. \n\nThe parents might have felt disrespected because they were not acknowledged when they arrived. However, the author's reasoning was to take care of his wife's health, especially during pregnancy. It's a common situation where family needs come first. On the other hand, the parents might have felt that their visit was important and expected a certain level of hospitality. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, not greeting guests immediately might be seen as rude. But the author did communicate via text that they would come down in 30 minutes. The parents might have expected a greeting, but the author thought they could wait. The wife's health and the kids' rest are valid considerations. The parents left upset, which is unfortunate, but the author's actions were to take care of his family's immediate needs. \n\nThe key points are the communication (they texted to let themselves in and communicated the time), the reason (wife's rest), and the parents' reaction. The author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing family needs. The parents might need to adjust their expectations considering the family's situation. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
