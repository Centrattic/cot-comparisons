The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. The situation is that the wife is heavily pregnant, there are twins who didn't nap, so they all ended up sleeping in the bed. The parents came over, the author texted them to let themselves in and told them to wait until 3, but his parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's wife is pregnant, which is a time when rest is crucial. The twins are young and not napping, so the family was tired. The author wanted to maximize their rest, which is understandable. He communicated with his parents that they should let themselves in and told them they'd come down in an hour. However, the parents felt snubbed because they weren't immediately greeted. \n\nNow, the key points: Did the author do something wrong? The parents were invited over, but the author prioritized the family's rest. The parents might have expected a more immediate greeting, but the author had a valid reason. However, communication might have been a factor. Did he set the right expectations? He told them to wait until 3, which gave the family time to rest. But maybe the parents felt it was disrespectful not to greet them upon arrival. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author had a good reason (family rest) and communicated the plan. The parents' reaction might be more about their feelings of being ignored rather than a clear wrongdoing by the author. The wife is upset because she blames herself, but the author's intention was to help her rest. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the situation involved a valid need for rest, and he communicated his plans. However, maybe there's a middle ground where the author could have found a solution that accommodated both the family's rest and parental greeting. But given the information, the author's actions seem justified.\n"
