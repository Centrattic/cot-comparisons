The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves parents coming over, the author deciding not to wake up his wife and kids to let them nap, and the parents getting upset about not being greeted immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who aren't napping. They all ended up sleeping in the bed. The parents were told to let themselves in and eat, and the author planned to meet them in an hour. The parents arrived at 2:30, and they were upset when the family didn't come down until 3. The parents left, and the wife felt guilty.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is about prioritizing rest for his wife and kids. But from the parents' perspective, maybe they felt disrespected or not considered. They might have expected to be greeted upon arrival, especially since they had been told to let themselves in. The author's message to the parents was to come in and make themselves at home, but not necessarily to wait an hour. However, the parents might have felt that being left alone for 30 minutes was rude.\n\nOn one hand, the author had valid reasons\u2014his wife is pregnant and needs sleep, the twins are not napping, so the family needed rest. On the other hand, not informing the parents or checking in when they arrived could have been a miscommunication. Maybe the author should have asked the parents to wait a bit longer or called them when the family was ready. Alternatively, if the parents arrived and the family was still asleep, maybe the author could have sent a quick message to update them on the delay, but since they had been told to make themselves at home, perhaps the author thought they'd be okay.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also important. If they were upset about not being greeted immediately, maybe they have a history of expecting prompt attention. The wife's upset reaction adds another layer\u2014she felt she should have been awake but was sleeping. It's possible that the author didn't consider how the parents would react, assuming they'd be okay with waiting. However, in social situations, even if you're in a good place for the family, guests might expect a certain level of hospitality. The author's actions, while intended to be considerate, might have overlooked the parents' expectations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The intention was to prioritize family rest, which is understandable. However, not communicating the delay or not considering the parents' potential discomfort might be where it goes wrong. The parents might have felt ignored or unimportant, even if the author had a good reason.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because not informing the parents immediately upon arrival and not checking in could be seen as a breach of hospitality, even if the intention was good. The parents might have felt unvalued, leading to their upset reaction. The author could have handled it better by maybe calling to let them know the delay or having someone else greet them briefly before the family was ready to come down.\n"
