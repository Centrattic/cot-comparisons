The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents came over. The wife is heavily pregnant, and the twins were already asleep on the bed. The husband told his parents to let themselves in and wait until 3, which would give the family an extra half hour of sleep. But when the family came down, the parents were upset and left, making the wife feel guilty.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the husband's reasoning: he wanted to maximize sleep for his wife and kids since they're dealing with a pregnant wife and twins. That seems considerate towards his family. He communicated with his parents, telling them to come in and wait, which he thought was reasonable. But then his parents felt ignored or disrespected because they weren't greeted immediately. They left upset, which probably hurt the wife's feelings.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? On one hand, he was trying to take care of his family's needs. On the other hand, not greeting guests when they arrive, even if you're not ready, might be seen as rude. But he did text them to let themselves in, which is a form of communication. The problem might be the expectation of how long to wait. The parents might have felt that waiting 30 minutes without any communication was abrupt or disrespectful. The husband assumed they could wait, but maybe the parents didn't have a clear idea of how long.\n\nAlso, the wife blamed herself for being asleep. Maybe the husband should have considered the parents' feelings more, even if it was a brief delay. There's a balance between the needs of the immediate family and the guests. In some cultures, hosting guests is very important, so maybe the husband's approach wasn't considerate enough. Alternatively, in a situation with a pregnant wife and young kids, the husband's priority is valid. \n\nBut the key point is that the parents felt \"rude\" and left. The husband's explanation didn't satisfy them. Perhaps he could have checked in with his parents after they arrived to let them know they were coming down soon. Or maybe the parents were more sensitive to the delay. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the husband's actions led to conflict, so maybe he's partially responsible for not anticipating the parents' feelings. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural norms and the parents' expectations. If the parents expected immediate greeting, then the delay was a problem. If the husband had communicated better during the wait, maybe the outcome would have been different. Since the parents left upset, and the wife was upset too, the husband's decision had negative consequences, so he might be in the wrong. But if the alternative was waking up a pregnant wife and tired kids, maybe he was justified. \n\nHmm. The user said they think the author is in the wrong. I'm leaning towards A (yes) because not greeting guests can be seen as rude, even if the intention was good. The husband might have been too focused on his family's rest and didn't consider the parents' perspective enough. But I'm not 100% sure. It's a tough call.\n"
