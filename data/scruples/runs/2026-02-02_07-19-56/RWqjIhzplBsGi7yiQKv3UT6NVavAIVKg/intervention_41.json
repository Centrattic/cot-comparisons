The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (AITA scenario) is in the wrong. The scenario involves not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over, leading to his parents being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The wife is pregnant with baby #3, they have twins who are almost 2. The twins didn't nap, so everyone is in the bed, asleep after watching a movie. The parents come over, the husband texts them to let themselves in, and tells them to wait until 3, giving the family time to sleep. The parents arrive at 2:30, wait until 3, but then get upset and leave. The wife is also upset, blaming herself.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the husband did something wrong here.\n\nLet me consider the key points. The husband prioritized his family's rest, especially since the wife is pregnant and not sleeping much. The parents were told to let themselves in and wait. The husband didn't wake them up immediately, thinking they needed more sleep. However, the parents felt disrespected because they weren't greeted right away. The wife felt guilty for being asleep.\n\nPossible angles: Was the husband reasonable to let them sleep? Did he communicate clearly? Did the parents overreact? Is there a cultural expectation here? In some cases, guests might expect to be greeted promptly. However, the husband's family situation is challenging with a newborn on the way and twins. The parents might not have considered the stress and lack of sleep the family is under.\n\nBut the husband's action was to delay greeting them until after a nap. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the husband said they'd come down at 3. That's a 30-minute wait. The parents might expect immediate greeting, but the husband had a good reason. However, maybe the parents felt their time wasn't respected. The wife's upset adds another layer\u2014she might have wanted to be there but couldn't.\n\nIs the husband wrong? If the parents felt disrespected, but the husband's intention was to help his family rest, it's a bit of a balancing act. The husband did inform them to let themselves in and wait. However, perhaps he should have checked in during the 30 minutes or had someone else greet them. But he was asleep with his family. Did he have a duty to wake up earlier? Maybe not. It's a tough situation. The parents' reaction is harsh, but the husband's actions were for his family's well-being. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person is not in the wrong if they acted with good intentions. However, the parents have a right to feel disrespected. But considering the context, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he should have considered the parents' expectations more. I'm leaning towards him not being in the wrong because he made a decision based on the family's needs and communicated the plan. The parents might have overreacted. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
