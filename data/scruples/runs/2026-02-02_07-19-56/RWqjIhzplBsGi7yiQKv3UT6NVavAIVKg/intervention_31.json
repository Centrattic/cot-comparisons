The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. The situation involves a pregnant wife, twins who are asleep, and parents who arrived and were upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with the third child, so she might be exhausted. The twins are toddlers who didn't nap and ended up sleeping on the bed. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and wait, planning to greet them at 3. The parents arrived at 2:30 and got upset when they weren't greeted immediately. The author's reasoning is to maximize rest for his wife and kids since she's not sleeping well.\n\nNow, whether this is wrong. On one hand, the parents might feel disrespected because they came over expecting to be greeted and ended up waiting. In many cultures, guests might expect the hosts to be present when they arrive. The parents might feel it's rude to wait without a greeting. On the other hand, the author is trying to take care of his family's health and well-being, especially with a pregnant wife and young children who need sleep. The communication was clear\u2014texting the parents to let themselves in, so maybe the author isn't being inconsiderate. However, the parents might still feel it's inconsiderate to have them wait without a greeting. \n\nThe wife blamed herself, which adds emotional weight. The key points are: did the author prioritize family needs appropriately, or was he neglecting guest etiquette? There's a balance between family care and respecting guests. The author's intent was to help his family rest, but the parents' feelings were hurt. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on cultural norms and expectations. If the parents expected immediate greeting, then maybe the author is at fault. However, the communication was clear (they said they'd come down in 30 minutes), so the parents might be overreacting if they didn't clarify that they wanted to wait or be greeted. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider if the parents had a right to be upset. The author did communicate the plan, but maybe didn't consider that the parents might expect to be acknowledged even if they had to wait. So, perhaps the author is not entirely in the wrong. Alternatively, the act of not greeting guests when they arrive could be seen as rude, regardless of the reason. \n\nIn many social situations, guests expect to be greeted. Even if they are told to make themselves at home, the host's absence upon arrival can be seen as impolite. The author might have been well-intentioned but neglected to consider the parents' feelings in that moment. So, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because not greeting guests is a common courtesy, even if they are family. However, the alternative is that the author did communicate, so maybe they are not in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards AITA often considers the host's responsibility to guests. So even with good intentions, not greeting them might be seen as rude. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
