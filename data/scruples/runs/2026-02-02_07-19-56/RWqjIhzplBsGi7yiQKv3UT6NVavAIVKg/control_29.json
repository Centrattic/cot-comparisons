The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault. The scenario involves the person not waking up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant, and the twins are young and not napping. They all ended up asleep on the father. The parents texted to let themselves in, and the author told them they'd be down in 30 minutes. The parents were upset about not being greeted immediately.\n\nSo, possible angles here: Is the father justified in prioritizing family rest? Did he communicate clearly? Did the parents have reasonable expectations? The author's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife and kids, which is understandable. However, not informing the parents of their plan in advance might have contributed to the misunderstanding. The parents might have expected immediate attention since they were visiting. The wife's upset reaction suggests that maybe the parents felt disrespected, even though the reason was valid.\n\nBut the key points are communication and expectations. The author texted the parents to let themselves in and mentioned they'd come down at 3. However, the parents might have thought they were supposed to wait until the family was ready, but their reaction was anger, which seems over the top. The author tried to explain, but the parents left, indicating a lack of flexibility on their part. \n\nIs the author wrong? Probably not, because he acted in good faith to rest his family. The parents should have been more understanding of the situation. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
