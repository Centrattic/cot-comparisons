The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband didn't wake his wife and kids when his parents arrived, even though the parents texted when they got there. The parents were upset and left, and the wife felt bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up sleeping in bed together. The husband texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, then said they'd come down in an hour. The parents were upset they weren't greeted immediately.\n\nHusbands often make decisions based on family needs. Here, the husband wanted to maximize the wife's rest because she's not sleeping much. The parents, on the other hand, might have expected to be greeted upon arrival. But the husband had communicated via text that the family would be down in an hour. So, was he wrong to keep them waiting?\n\nThe parents might feel disrespected, but the husband's reasoning is about the well-being of his pregnant wife and tired children. The wife felt bad for being asleep, but the husband's choice was to prioritize her rest. However, maybe there's a middle ground. Did he consider informing the parents earlier that they might be late? Or maybe letting them in and then going back to sleep? But the parents had already arrived and waited an hour.\n\nCultural expectations might play a role here. In some families, guests are expected to be greeted immediately. However, the husband's situation is challenging with young kids and a pregnant spouse. The parents might not fully understand the stress and lack of sleep the family is experiencing.\n\nIt's also possible that the parents took offense because they weren't considered. The husband's communication was via text, which might not convey the urgency or reason effectively. Maybe if he had called or explained more clearly, the parents would have been more understanding.\n\nBut the key points are: the husband made a choice based on his family's needs, communicated the time they'd be down, and the parents still got upset. The wife's health and rest are important, especially in pregnancy. Children's naps are crucial for their well-being too.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It depends on whether prioritizing his family's rest over immediate social etiquette is justified. In this case, he might not be in the wrong because he's managing a difficult situation. However, maybe there was a better way to handle the communication. But given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
