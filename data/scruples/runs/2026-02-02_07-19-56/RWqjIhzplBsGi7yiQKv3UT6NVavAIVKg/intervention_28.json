The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation is that his wife is pregnant, they have twins, and they all ended up napping in bed. He told his parents to let themselves in and they'd come down in 30 minutes. But his parents were upset that they weren't greeted immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's reasoning was to let his wife and kids get more sleep because she's pregnant and not sleeping well. He thought giving his parents 30 minutes to themselves would be acceptable. However, his parents felt it was rude not to greet them right away and left upset. The wife also blamed herself for being asleep.\n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be considerate of his family's needs, especially the wife's health during pregnancy. It's understandable that with twins and a third child on the way, sleep is a premium. The parents might not have been aware of the situation and expected a greeting. On the other hand, guests usually expect to be greeted promptly when they arrive. The parents might have felt ignored or that their visit wasn't respected.\n\nThe key points here are communication and guest expectations. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and mentioned they'd come down in 30 minutes. But maybe the parents didn't realize that the delay was due to family needs, or perhaps the 30 minutes felt too long. The author's explanation about the naps might not have been communicated effectively. The wife's upset reaction adds to the tension, indicating that maybe the parents' feelings were more important than the naps, but the author prioritized the family's rest.\n\nIn terms of blame, it's a balance between family obligations and respecting guests. The author might have assumed the parents would understand the situation, but the parents' reaction suggests they didn't see it that way. The author could have perhaps checked in with the parents earlier or set clearer expectations about the visit given the circumstances. However, the intention was to help the family rest, which is valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the parents expected to be greeted immediately and the author didn't consider that, he might be partly at fault. But if the situation was communicated clearly and the parents were unreasonable, then maybe not. The answer depends on cultural norms and expectations around hospitality. In many cases, guests expect a greeting, so the delay might be seen as rude. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the parents' perspective more fully. But some might argue that the family's well-being was more important. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe there's nuance.\n"
