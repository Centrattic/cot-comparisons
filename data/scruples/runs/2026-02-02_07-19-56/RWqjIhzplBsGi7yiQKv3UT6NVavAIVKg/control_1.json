The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins refused to nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie, and everyone fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd be down at 3. The idea was to give the wife three hours of sleep and the twins an hour and a half. When they came down, the parents were upset and called them rude. The wife blamed herself for being asleep. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant, which can be exhausting. The twins are toddlers who might not nap regularly. The author's decision to let them sleep is understandable from a health and well-being perspective. Parents often prioritize rest for a pregnant spouse and young children. However, the parents expected to be greeted upon arrival, which is a common social norm. The author's parents might have felt slighted or ignored, especially since they had to let themselves in without being there.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author had already communicated that they would be down in 30 minutes. The parents might have had an unspoken expectation of immediate interaction, but the author gave a specific timeframe. The parents' reaction could be seen as overreacting, as they had prior notice and the author was managing the family's needs. The wife being upset is a point too; her health is important, especially with a third child on the way.\n\nI need to weigh the social expectations against the family's well-being. While it's polite to greet guests promptly, the author made a judgment call based on the circumstances. The parents might have misread the situation, expecting more immediate attention. The key factors here are communication and the reasonableness of the author's decision. The author did inform the parents of the delay, so maybe the fault isn't entirely on them. However, not considering the parents' feelings could be a point against the author. \n\nBut given the stress on the wife and the need for rest, it's a common-sense decision. The parents might have needed to be more understanding given the family's situation. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because he prioritized the family's health and communicated the delay. The parents' reaction is the issue here, not the author's intent.\n"
