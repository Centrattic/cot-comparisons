The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The wife is super pregnant with baby number three, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins refused to nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents arrived at 2:30 PM, and the author told them to let themselves in and eat. He said they'd come down by 3 PM. The parents were upset they weren't greeted and left, and the wife blamed herself.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning was to let everyone nap because the wife isn't sleeping much. The parents expected to be greeted upon arrival. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for not waking them up.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author was trying to help his family rest, especially considering the wife's health and the kids. The twins didn't nap, so they needed sleep. The parents were told they could make themselves at home, so maybe the author thought they'd be okay waiting. But the parents felt ignored, which is a valid feeling. \n\nBut was the author wrong? Well, maybe not. He made a judgment call based on the family's need for rest. However, maybe he should have considered the parents' feelings more. Did he communicate clearly enough? He told them to let themselves in and eat, but didn't mention the naps. Maybe the parents expected to be acknowledged immediately. \n\nBut the wife and kids were finally getting some sleep, which is important. The author tried to explain, but the parents were upset. The wife was also upset. So maybe the author wasn't wrong, but perhaps he could have handled it differently. Like, maybe letting the parents know the situation earlier or having someone else greet them? But in the moment, he was trying to help his family. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But since the parents were upset and felt ignored, maybe the author should have prioritized their feelings more. Or maybe not, because the family's rest was also important. It's hard to say. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA situations, the key is to consider if the action was reasonable. The author's actions were to protect his family's rest. The parents had their expectations not met. It's possible the author isn't wrong because he made a reasonable decision, but maybe there's room for understanding both sides. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he was trying to help his family, which is important, especially with a pregnant wife and young children. However, there's a middle ground where communication could have been better. But in terms of being in the wrong, probably not. So the answer is B.\n"
