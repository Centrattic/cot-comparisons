The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife is very pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't take a nap and ended up all sleeping in bed together. The parents were coming over, so the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd come down at 3, allowing for a bit more sleep. But the parents were upset about not being greeted immediately and left angry. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' expectations versus the author's actions. The parents might have expected to be greeted upon arrival, maybe feeling that the family should be up and ready. The author, on the other hand, thought maximizing sleep was more important, especially considering the wife's condition and the twins' nap refusal. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms too. In some families, it's expected to be present when relatives arrive, so the parents might feel disrespected. However, the author's reasoning is about health and well-being, especially with a pregnant wife and young children. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't communicate clearly enough. He told his parents to let themselves in and eat, but maybe they still expected a greeting. The author assumed an hour was enough for them to wait, but maybe that's not reasonable. \n\nThe parents leaving upset suggests they felt disrespected. The wife blaming herself might indicate that the family's current situation is stressful, and the parents' reaction added to that stress. \n\nOn the flip side, the author was trying to prioritize family rest, which is important given their circumstances. However, not considering the parents' feelings might be a mistake. Maybe there's a middle ground, like waking up briefly to greet them and then let everyone rest again. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the parents expected immediate greeting and the author didn't make his plans clear enough, he might share some responsibility. However, the context of a very pregnant wife and young kids adds complexity. \n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's intention was to help everyone rest, which is valid. But some might say he should have considered the parents' feelings more. However, given the situation, prioritizing the health of his family could be justified. So maybe B is the right choice here.\n"
