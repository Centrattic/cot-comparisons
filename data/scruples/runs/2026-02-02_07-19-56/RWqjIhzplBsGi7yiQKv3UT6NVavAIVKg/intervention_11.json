The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband decided not to wake his wife and kids when his parents arrived, even though he had texted them to let themselves in. The parents got upset because they felt ignored and left.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband had a valid reason: his wife is pregnant, the twins were refusing naps, and they were all asleep. He wanted to maximize their rest. He texted his parents to let themselves in and mentioned they'd come down at 3. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited until 3, but then left upset. The husband tried to explain, but the parents were mad.\n\nNow, considering both sides. On one hand, the parents might have expected a greeting or some interaction. They might have felt disrespected by being ignored for 30 minutes. On the other hand, the husband was trying to take care of his family's needs, especially his wife's health during pregnancy. Prioritizing rest for the family could be seen as responsible.\n\nBut maybe the husband should have communicated better. He told the parents they'd be down at 3, but maybe he should have specified that they would come down to greet them, not just that they would be down. The parents might have interpreted \"be down at 3\" as the family would be available then. Alternatively, maybe he should have checked in with his parents during the wait or had someone else greet them briefly.\n\nAlso, the wife felt blamed herself, which adds to the emotional impact. The husband's parents might have felt that their presence wasn't respected. However, the husband's decision was based on genuine family needs. \n\nIn some cultures, family priorities might be more emphasized, while in others, respecting guests' expectations is key. The husband might have underestimated how important it was for the parents to be greeted immediately. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a balance. He had a good intention, but perhaps the execution was flawed. Maybe not waking them up wasn't the issue, but not ensuring that the parents felt welcomed despite the delay. Alternatively, if the parents expected to be woken up, then he's in the wrong for not doing so. But the parents had been told to let themselves in, so maybe the husband's plan was reasonable. \n\nI think there's a gray area here. The parents might have overreacted, but the husband could have made his communication clearer. However, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. If the parents had a right to expect a greeting, then yes. If the husband had a legitimate reason and communicated clearly, then no. Since he texted them to let themselves in and said they'd come down at 3, maybe the expectation was that they'd come down to interact then. But the parents might have felt that waiting 30 minutes without any contact was rude. \n\nI'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because he prioritized his family's health, but there's room for improvement in communication. However, the parents' reaction might be seen as unreasonable. The answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. In many cases, guests might expect some form of greeting, even if it's brief. So maybe the husband should have at least sent a quick message to let them know they were still asleep but would come down soon. Without that, the parents might feel ignored. \n\nSo, considering all factors, I think the husband is not entirely in the wrong, but there are aspects where he could have done better. But the question is whether he is in the wrong at all. Since the parents left upset, maybe there's a case to be made that he was inconsiderate of their expectations. However, his action was to protect his family's rest. It's a tough call. I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A. The key is whether his actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since he communicated his plan and the parents chose to wait, maybe he's in the right. But if the parents expected immediate interaction, then he's in the wrong. The text doesn't clarify if the parents were aware that the family would be unavailable for 30 minutes. The husband texted them when they arrived and said they'd be down at 3, which might have been sufficient. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
