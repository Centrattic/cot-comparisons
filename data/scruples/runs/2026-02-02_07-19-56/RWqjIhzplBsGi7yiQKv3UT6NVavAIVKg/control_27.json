The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is that the person didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents arrived, leading to the parents being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife is pregnant with baby #3, and they have twins around 2 years old. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, so the husband texted them to let themselves in. The parents arrived at 2:30, and he told them they'd be down by 3, giving everyone time to nap. When they came down later, the parents were upset about not being greeted immediately. The wife felt bad for being asleep, and the parents left upset.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and expectations. In many families, especially close-knit ones, there's an expectation to greet guests promptly upon arrival. However, the husband's reasoning was to let his family rest, especially since the wife is pregnant and the kids aren't napping well. The parents might have felt disrespected by not being greeted upon arrival, even if the intention was to rest.\n\nBut on the other hand, the husband did text his parents to let themselves in, which is considerate. He also gave a reason for the delay, which was their nap time. The parents might have expected a greeting once they arrived, but perhaps the husband's priority was necessary given the circumstances.\n\nI should also think about whether the husband's actions were reasonable. The wife is pregnant and not sleeping much, so maximizing rest makes sense. The twins are young and not napping, so the family was already exhausted. The husband's plan to give them time to nap was logical to ensure they could handle the visit later. However, the parents might not have considered the family's situation and felt slighted regardless.\n\nAnother angle is communication. Maybe the husband should have communicated better with his parents beforehand, explaining why they weren't immediately available. He did text them when they arrived, but perhaps the parents expected a phone call instead of a text, or maybe the message wasn't clear enough. However, in this case, he did inform them they'd be down in 30 minutes, so he did communicate the plan.\n\nThe parents leaving upset suggests they felt offended, but the husband's actions were to prioritize his family's well-being. It's a balance between respecting guests and managing a chaotic home situation with young children. In such cases, it's often hard to please everyone, but the husband's decision might be seen as reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would depend on whether the husband's actions were seen as neglecting the guests or prioritizing family needs. Since the parents left upset but the husband had a valid reason, the author might not be in the wrong. The wife's upset feelings add another layer, but she wasn't the one who decided not to wake up; the husband made that call. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
