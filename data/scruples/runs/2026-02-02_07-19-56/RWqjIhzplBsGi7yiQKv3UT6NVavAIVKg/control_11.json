The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents arrived, thinking they needed rest. The parents were upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with the third child, and they have twins. The kids refused to nap, so they all ended up in bed. The parents came over, and the husband texted them to let themselves in and said they'd be down in an hour. The parents were upset because they were not greeted immediately. The wife blamed herself for being asleep.\n\nThe key points here are the family's state of exhaustion and the parents' expectations. The husband tried to prioritize the family's rest, especially since the wife isn't sleeping much. But the parents felt unappreciated or disrespected. \n\nIs the husband at fault? Well, he did inform the parents to let themselves in, so they knew they could make themselves at home. The husband's intention was to let everyone rest. However, maybe he should have checked in with his parents or given them a heads-up that they might be waiting a bit. But he did say they'd come down in an hour. The parents left because they were upset, but the husband's actions were to take care of his family's needs. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents' reaction is a bit harsh, but the husband didn't communicate properly. Did he overstep by not waking the family? Given the circumstances, it seems like a reasonable choice. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no hidden wrong. Maybe he should have at least greeted his parents when they arrived? But he was busy with the kids and wife. It's a tough situation. I think B is correct.\n"
