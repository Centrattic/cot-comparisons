The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) who didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is at fault but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins. The kids wouldn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author told them to let themselves in and wait, promising to come down at 3. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited 30 minutes, and then were upset when the family didn't greet them immediately. They left angry, and the wife felt bad.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author made a mistake by not waking his family up to meet the parents. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to let his wife get more sleep. Pregnancy can be exhausting, especially with two young kids. The twins were already not napping, so getting any rest is important. The author texted the parents to let themselves in and eat, which shows they tried to accommodate them. The parents were given a timeframe (until 3) and were told to make themselves comfortable, which is common in many households.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents felt disrespected and left out. They might have expected to be greeted upon arrival, especially in cultures where hospitality is important. The author's parents might not have realized the context of the family's situation. The wife feeling guilty adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nNow, considering the cultural norms around hospitality and family dynamics. In some cultures, guests are expected to be greeted immediately, while in others, flexibility is more accepted. The parents might not have known that the family was in a vulnerable state, so they took it personally.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he made a judgment call based on the situation he knew. He communicated his plan ahead of time. However, maybe he should have considered the parents' feelings more. Perhaps there was a way to balance both the family's need for rest and the parents' expectations of hospitality. For example, maybe a quick greeting from the author while the family remained asleep? But the author might have thought that waking up the wife and kids would defeat the purpose of the nap.\n\nAlso, the wife feeling responsible adds another layer. The author could have supported her better in that moment, ensuring she didn't take the blame.\n\nSo, the answer isn't black and white. The author's intentions were good, but maybe he didn't consider the parents' perspective enough. However, given the circumstances of his family's needs, he might argue he was in the right. But since the parents felt disrespected and it caused emotional distress, there's a case for him being in the wrong.\n\nI think the best answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the situation was tough, the parents were guests and their feelings matter. The author could have found a middle ground, like greeting them briefly and then excusing himself to let the family rest. But maybe others would say B. Hmm.\n"
