The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the user didn't wake their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The wife is pregnant with baby number three, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents came over, and the user told them to let themselves in and said they'd come down in an hour. The parents got upset because they weren't greeted and left.\n\nHmm, so the user thought about the wife's sleep, which is important, especially during pregnancy. The parents might have expected to be greeted immediately. But the user's reasoning was to let the family rest. But maybe the parents felt disrespected because they weren't acknowledged when they arrived. The user texted them to let themselves in, which is probably okay, but not informing them to wait or expecting them to wait for an hour without any communication. Maybe the parents felt ignored. Also, the wife blamed herself, which adds to the emotional impact.\n\nWait, the user told the parents they'd be down at 3, so they had a specific time. The parents arrived at 2:30, so they had a half-hour wait. The user thought they could just watch TV. But maybe the parents didn't want to wait or felt it was rude not to greet them immediately. Family dynamics can be tricky here. The user's intention was to prioritize rest for their family, which is understandable, especially with the wife's health. However, the parents might have different expectations about hospitality. \n\nIs the user in the wrong? If they communicated the time clearly, maybe not. But maybe they should have considered that the parents might not be comfortable waiting alone. Or maybe the way they handled it wasn't respectful. But the user's reasoning seems valid. The parents might be overreacting. The answer could be B, the author isn't in the wrong because they had a good reason to let the family rest. However, there's a nuance in how they communicated it. If they had informed the parents to wait, maybe it's okay. But the parents felt upset regardless. So maybe the answer is B, but it's a close call.\n"
