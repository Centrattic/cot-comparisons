The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user's wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon. The user texted them to let themselves in and eat whatever. They arrived at 2:30 and the user said they'd come down at 3, giving the wife three hours of sleep and the twins about 1.5 hours. The parents were upset they weren't greeted and left. The wife felt guilty for being asleep.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The user's reasoning was to maximize rest for the wife and kids. The parents felt it was rude not to greet them immediately. The wife is upset too.\n\nSo, considering the context: the parents were allowed to enter and make themselves at home. The user texted them to come in, and they arrived. The user gave a time when they'd come down, which was 30 minutes after arrival. The parents were upset they weren't greeted. But the user had a valid reason\u2014family rest. However, maybe the user should have considered the parents' feelings more? Maybe they should have woken up briefly to greet them, even if just for a minute. Or maybe the parents are being overly sensitive. \n\nBut the user's wife is pregnant and not sleeping much, so prioritizing her rest makes sense. However, the parents might have felt ignored or disrespected. The user didn't consider that maybe the parents wanted to be greeted right away. Also, the user didn't wake them up even for a short time. The parents left, which is a big deal. The user's wife felt bad about it, which adds to the emotional impact.\n\nOn one hand, the user had a good reason to let the family rest. On the other hand, not greeting guests could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the parents were looking forward to seeing them. Maybe the user should have found a middle ground, like waking up to greet them briefly before going back to sleep. \n\nBut the user didn't do that. They left the parents waiting for 30 minutes without any communication. Maybe the parents felt disrespected because the user didn't follow through on the initial greeting. So, the user might be at fault for not considering the parents' feelings, even if their intention was to help the family rest. The answer might lean towards AITA for the user because they could have handled it differently to avoid offending the parents.\n"
