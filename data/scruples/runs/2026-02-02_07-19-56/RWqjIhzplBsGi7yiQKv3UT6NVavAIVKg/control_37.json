The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. \n\nFirst, the situation: The man's wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't take a nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. His parents were coming over in the afternoon. He texted them to let themselves in and eat, telling them they'd come down by 3. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the man said they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents got upset and left, feeling ignored. The wife was also upset, blaming herself for being asleep.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' expectations versus the son's actions. The parents might have expected to be greeted upon arrival, especially if it's a family tradition or if they felt it was important to have someone around. The son, however, was trying to prioritize his wife's rest during her pregnancy and the twins' naps. \n\nFrom the son's perspective, he was trying to be considerate of his family's needs. His wife isn't sleeping well, so he wanted to maximize her rest. The twins were already asleep, so waking them up might not have been ideal. He communicated his plan to the parents, telling them they could come in and make themselves comfortable. \n\nBut the parents felt it was rude because they arrived and weren't greeted. They might have felt that it was inconsiderate not to wake up the family to meet them. The wife's upset reaction suggests that maybe she felt the same way, or perhaps she didn't expect the parents to be that upset. \n\nNow, considering cultural norms, some families might expect certain behaviors when guests arrive. If the parents are used to being greeted immediately, then the son's delay might seem disrespectful. However, the son's actions were based on the family's current situation: a pregnant wife and young children who need rest. \n\nThe parents' reaction could be seen as overly sensitive, especially since they were told to let themselves in and given a timeframe. The son didn't ignore them; he just delayed meeting them to allow family rest. However, the parents might not have considered the family's circumstances and felt slighted. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the son made an effort to inform the parents of the plan. The issue might be a communication breakdown or differing expectations. The parents might have expected a different level of interaction. \n\nBut considering the context of the family's needs, the son's decision to prioritize rest seems reasonable. Unless there was a prior agreement that the family should always greet parents immediately upon arrival, the son isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents should have been understanding given the situation. \n\nThe wife's upset reaction might also contribute to the parents' frustration if they felt she wasn't present. But the son's intention was to help his wife get rest, which is a valid consideration during pregnancy. \n\nIn conclusion, the son's actions were based on the family's needs, and he communicated his plans. The parents' reaction seems to stem from unmet expectations rather than the son being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
