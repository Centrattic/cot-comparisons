The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation is that the author had his parents coming over, but his wife was pregnant and the twins were asleep. He texted his parents to let themselves in and told them they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents were upset and left, and now the wife is upset too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is very pregnant, so she's probably exhausted. The twins are almost 2 and refused naps, so they might be overtired. The author wanted to let them all sleep to maximize rest. That makes sense from a parent's perspective, especially with multiple young kids. \n\nBut then, the parents arrived and were upset. The author didn't answer the door or wake up the family. The parents might have expected a greeting, which is common in many families. Maybe they felt ignored or not respected. The author's reasoning was to let them rest, but maybe he didn't consider his parents' feelings. Did he communicate clearly? He told them to let themselves in and said they'd come down at 3. But maybe the parents wanted to be acknowledged upon arrival. \n\nAlso, the wife blamed herself for being asleep. That adds to the emotional impact. The author might not have thought through how his parents would feel waiting alone. Even if the parents are often okay watching TV, being left waiting might have made them feel unwelcome. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to take care of his family's needs. The wife's health and the kids' rest are important. But family dynamics can be tricky. Maybe there's a cultural or personal expectation about receiving guests. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He had a valid reason, but not considering his parents' feelings might have been a mistake. The key point is whether not greeting them immediately was rude. If the parents expected a greeting, then not doing so could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the author was prioritizing his family's well-being. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the author's intention was to help his family rest, which is understandable. However, maybe he could have handled the communication better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards not, because the intent was good and the situation is challenging. Alternatively, if the parents felt disrespected, the author might have been inconsiderate. But given the context of a tired family with a new baby, it's a tough spot. I'm leaning towards B (No).\n"
