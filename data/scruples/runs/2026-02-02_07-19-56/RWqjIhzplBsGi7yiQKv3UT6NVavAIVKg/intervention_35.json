The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for not waking up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The situation is that the wife is heavily pregnant, the twins are two years old and didn't nap, so they all ended up sleeping in the bed. The parents came over, and the husband texted them to let themselves in and eat. He told them to come at 2:30, and they'd be down by 3. But the parents were upset they weren't greeted and left. The wife felt bad.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me think. On one hand, the husband wanted to let his family rest, especially the wife who's pregnant. That makes sense because rest is important during pregnancy. The twins not napping and all being in bed probably made it hard to get rest. The husband tried to communicate with his parents, told them to come at 2:30 and they'd be down by 3. The parents arrived, but were upset because they weren't greeted immediately.\n\nBut maybe the parents felt disrespected. They might have expected a greeting upon arrival, even if they were told to let themselves in. Maybe they felt that waiting 30 minutes was too long. Alternatively, maybe the husband should have checked in with his parents when they arrived, even if he wasn't going to wake the family. Or perhaps he should have woken up his wife to greet them briefly before going back to sleep? But if the wife was asleep, waking her up might have disrupted her rest. \n\nAnother angle: the husband made a plan and communicated it, but the parents didn't like the silence. Maybe there's a cultural expectation here about how to treat guests. If the parents expected to be greeted immediately, then the husband's plan might not align with that. However, considering the wife's health and the kids' needs, maybe it's reasonable to prioritize rest. \n\nThe wife felt responsible for being asleep, which is a sad outcome. The husband might have failed to communicate clearly to his parents, leading to their upset. Also, maybe the parents felt that not showing up at the agreed time was disrespectful. The husband gave them a 30-minute window, but maybe they expected a more immediate greeting. \n\nSo, is the husband wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's trying to care for his family's needs. On the other, guests might expect some form of greeting. Maybe he could have found a middle ground, like waking up briefly to let the parents know they were sleeping and would come down soon, but not waking up the kids. However, with twins and a pregnant wife, it's logistically difficult. The parents' reaction might be a bit harsh, but the husband's decision to wait could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband adequately considered both his family's needs and his parents' expectations. He did communicate the plan, but maybe didn't account for the emotional impact of the parents feeling ignored. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there are aspects where he could have done better. However, the main question is if he's in the wrong. Given the context, maybe it's a judgment call, but leaning towards not being in the wrong because he prioritized his wife's health and the kids' needs, which are important. So answer B.\n"
