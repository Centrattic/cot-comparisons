The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is at fault. So, the situation is that the person didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The wife is heavily pregnant and the twins had a rough nap time. They all ended up sleeping. The parents texted arrival and were told they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with her third child, and they have twins who are hard to nap. It's a stressful time, and the person wanted to maximize rest for the family. They texted the parents to let themselves in, which was probably to avoid waking the family. The parents were upset because they weren't greeted immediately. \n\nOn one hand, the person had a valid reason to let the family rest. Pregnancy fatigue is real, and twins can be challenging. They gave a heads-up about the delay, which shows consideration. The parents might have expected more immediate attention, but maybe they didn't consider the circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel disrespected. Even if the intention was good, not greeting guests when they arrive can be seen as rude. The author's explanation might not have placated them. The wife blaming herself suggests that maybe the parents felt neglected. \n\nBut considering the situation, the author's decision to prioritize the family's health and rest might be understandable. The parents might need to be more empathetic in this situation. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a balance between being considerate and being respectful to guests.\n\nHmm, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a judgment call based on the family's needs and communicated the plan. The parents might need to adjust their expectations given the current family situation.\n"
