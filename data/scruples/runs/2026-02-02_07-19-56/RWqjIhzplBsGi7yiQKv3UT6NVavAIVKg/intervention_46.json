The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived, leading to his parents feeling upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's wife is heavily pregnant, and they have twins who wouldn't nap. They all ended up sleeping in bed. The parents were coming over, so the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author said they'd come down at 3 to allow everyone to rest. But the parents were upset about not being greeted and left. The wife also felt bad for being asleep.\n\nNow, considering the possible angles. The author's reasoning was to allow his family to rest, especially the wife who isn't sleeping much. However, not informing the parents when they arrived and not greeting them might be seen as inconsiderate. The parents might have expected a greeting when they arrived, even if they were told to let themselves in. The author's message to the parents was to arrive and wait until 3, but maybe the parents felt ignored. Also, the wife blaming herself adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision was to prioritize family rest, which is understandable given the circumstances. The parents were informed to let themselves in, so maybe they expected some acknowledgment upon arrival. However, not waking up the family immediately might be seen as not respecting the parents' time or their presence. \n\nI think the key here is communication. The author did inform the parents to let themselves in, but didn't set clear expectations about not being there immediately. The parents might have felt disrespected because they were not greeted. Even if they were told to help themselves, the social norm is usually to greet visitors upon arrival. The author's explanation about napping is valid, but the execution might have been poor. The parents' reaction, while perhaps over the top, is a common response to feeling ignored. The author's responsibility was to balance his family's needs with respecting his parents' expectations. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. However, the parents' feelings were hurt, and the author didn't account for their need to feel welcomed. So, while the author had a valid reason, the way he handled it might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
