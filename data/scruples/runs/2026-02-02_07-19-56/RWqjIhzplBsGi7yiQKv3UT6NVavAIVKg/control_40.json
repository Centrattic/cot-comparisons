The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The scenario involves the author not waking their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The parents came over in the afternoon, the author texted them to let themselves in. The author planned to come down an hour later so everyone could nap. The parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant, which is a significant factor. The twins are refusing naps, so they're all sleeping together on the bed. The author wanted to let them rest because the wife isn't sleeping well. The parents were told they could come in and make themselves comfortable. The author thought an hour would be enough for the family to rest before joining the parents.\n\nThe parents were upset because they weren't greeted immediately. The author explained the reason, but the parents were still mad and left. The wife blamed herself for being asleep. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, especially with a pregnant wife and young children, ensuring the family gets enough rest is crucial. The author made a reasonable decision to prioritize their family's well-being. The parents might not understand the stress of having a third baby, especially with twins. However, the author could have considered the parents' feelings. Maybe a phone call to explain the delay instead of just texting them to let themselves in would have been better. But given the situation, the author's actions seem justified. The parents' reaction might be harsh, expecting immediate hospitality even in a family crisis. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
