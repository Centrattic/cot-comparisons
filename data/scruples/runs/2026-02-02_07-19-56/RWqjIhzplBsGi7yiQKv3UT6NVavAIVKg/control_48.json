The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe situation: The person's wife is very pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't go down for a nap, so the whole family was in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, so the author texted them to let themselves in and eat what they want. When the parents arrived at 2:30, he said they'd be down at 3. The parents were upset that they weren't greeted immediately and left mad. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parents' expectations versus the author's actions. The parents probably expected to be greeted when they arrived, but the author thought giving the family time to nap was more important. The parents felt it was rude not to come down right away. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, from a family care perspective, prioritizing the wife's rest when she's pregnant makes sense. The twins are young and need naps too. The author did communicate the arrival time and let the parents know they could come in. But maybe the parents had different expectations, especially if they're used to being greeted. However, the author's intention was to help his family get rest, which is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like telling the parents they were on their way but needed a bit more time. But the parents left because they were upset. The wife was also upset, blaming herself, which adds to the emotional toll. \n\nI think it's a bit of a judgment call. The author's actions were to protect his family's well-being, which is understandable. However, not considering the parents' feelings might be a misstep. But given the circumstances, the author's priority was family rest. So maybe not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
