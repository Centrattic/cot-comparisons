The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The situation involves a very pregnant wife and twins who were all asleep. The author texted the parents to let themselves in and told them they'd come down an hour later. The parents were upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant, which can be a tiring time, and the twins are young, so their naps are important. The author wanted to maximize rest for them. But is it wrong to prioritize their family's rest over the parents' expectations?\n\nThe parents came over for an afternoon visit. The author gave them a heads-up that they'd be down in an hour, so the parents could have waited. But instead, the parents felt ignored. Communication might be a factor here. The author texted them when they arrived and gave a timeframe, but maybe the parents expected a more immediate greeting. \n\nIn some cultures, family visits are expected to be more formal, and not greeting them immediately might be seen as rude. However, in a situation where the host is clearly unwell or caring for young children, others might be more understanding. The wife's health and the children's needs are important, so the author's intention was good. \n\nBut the parents' feelings are also valid. They might have felt disrespected or not considered. The author could have perhaps offered to meet them briefly but the situation was that everyone was asleep. Maybe the parents expected the kids to be awake anyway. \n\nThe wife blamed herself, which adds to the emotional toll. The author might have handled the explanation better, but the decision to nap was made to help her. \n\nConsidering all this, the author wasn't necessarily in the wrong because they prioritized their family's well-being given the circumstances. However, there could be a cultural or personal expectation difference. But overall, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
