The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they're at fault for not waking up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon. The user texted them to let themselves in and said they'd come down at 3, giving the family time to nap. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited until 3, and then were upset about not being greeted immediately. They left, and the wife felt bad.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the parents' expectations versus the user's actions. The user wanted to let the family rest, especially the pregnant wife. But the parents were expecting to be greeted right away. The user tried to explain, but the parents were upset. \n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective: They were invited over, arrived on time, and felt ignored. Not answering the door when they arrived could be seen as rude, even if the reason was valid. But the user had a good reason, prioritizing their family's rest. The parents might not have considered the circumstances, especially since they left and caused the wife to feel guilty.\n\nOn the other hand, the user did communicate that they'd be down at 3. They didn't ignore messages. The parents might have wanted immediate interaction, but the user had a valid reason to delay. It's possible the parents misunderstood the situation or didn't take into account the family's current stress with the twins and pregnancy.\n\nSo, is the user at fault? They tried to be considerate of their family's needs. The parents overreacted and didn't respect the user's reasoning. However, maybe the user could have informed the parents of the situation in advance, like explaining the twins' behavior and the wife's exhaustion before the visit. But given the circumstances, the main issue is the parents' reaction. The user isn't in the wrong here because their actions were to help their family rest, which is understandable. The parents' expectations were unmet, but that doesn't make the user at fault. So the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
