The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for not waking his wife and kids when his parents arrived. \n\nFirst, the key points: The wife is very pregnant with baby #3 and has twins who are almost 2. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, so the husband texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, were told they'd come down at 3. The husband thought giving them 30 minutes to wait was okay since they often watch TV there. The parents felt they were treated rudely and left upset. The wife also blamed herself.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the husband's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife and kids, especially given the challenging time with pregnancy and twins. It's understandable that the family would need as much rest as possible. The parents had been informed in advance and knew to let themselves in. The husband gave a specific time to meet them, which the parents respected but felt they were kept waiting. \n\nHowever, the parents might have expected a greeting upon arrival, even if it was brief. Not acknowledging their arrival immediately could be seen as neglectful, especially in some cultural contexts where hospitality is important. The wife feeling upset adds another layer, as the parents' reaction might have affected her emotionally. \n\nBut on the other hand, the husband was trying to balance the family's needs with hosting. The parents had been told to make themselves at home, so maybe the expectation wasn't clear. It's a judgment call. The husband's intention wasn't to be rude, but perhaps the action came off that way. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's a mix. The parents could have been more understanding of the family's situation, but the husband might have considered a compromise, like briefly greeting them and then returning to rest. However, given the circumstances and the husband's reasoning, it's more about differing expectations rather than a clear wrong.\n"
