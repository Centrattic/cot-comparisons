The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents were upset because they had to wait, and the family ended up leaving. The user thinks the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife is very pregnant, and they have young twins. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed. The author told the parents to let themselves in and that they'd come down at 3. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited 30 minutes, then left upset. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nPossible angles: Was the author's decision to let them nap reasonable? Parents coming over might expect some form of greeting or interaction. The author's intention was to let the family rest, which is understandable given the circumstances\u2014pregnancy and toddlers. But maybe the parents felt disrespected or not appreciated. The author didn't check in with the parents during the wait, which could have helped. Also, the wife felt responsible, so maybe the author didn't communicate well with her about the plan.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have overreacted. The author did inform them of the plan, and 30 minutes isn't too long. But maybe in some cultural contexts, expecting family to wait without a greeting is considered rude. The parents might have felt ignored or unwelcome. The author's reasoning was to prioritize family rest, but perhaps he should have considered the parents' feelings more. Maybe a middle ground was possible, like letting them in but allowing the family to rest for a bit longer. Or the author could have woken up briefly to greet them even if staying in bed for a while.\n\nAnother point: the wife being pregnant and not sleeping well makes her rest important. The author tried to maximize her rest, which is commendable. But the parents' feelings might have been valid too. The wife's upset feelings add to the complexity. The author might have not considered that the parents might feel their visit wasn't valued.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. If the parents were expecting immediate attention and felt ignored, the author might have been inconsiderate. However, given the family's situation, the author's actions were to protect their well-being. The answer might depend on the importance placed on family visiting versus the need for rest. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author's intention was good, but the execution might have been lacking. Maybe the parents' upset is valid, but the author isn't entirely in the wrong. However, maybe the author should have considered the parents' perspective more. But given the circumstances, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). Alternatively, maybe A. Hmm.\n"
