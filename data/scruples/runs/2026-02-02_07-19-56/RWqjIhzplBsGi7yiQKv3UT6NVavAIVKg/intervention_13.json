The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is super pregnant with baby #3, and they have twins who are almost 2. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author texted them to let themselves in. The parents arrived at 2:30, and he said they'd be down at 3. The parents were upset that they weren't greeted immediately and left. The wife was upset too, blaming herself for sleeping.\n\nSo the main issue is whether it was wrong to not wake them up. The author's reasoning was to let the wife and kids nap longer because she's not sleeping much. But the parents felt it was rude not to greet them upon arrival.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author was trying to help his family get rest, which is understandable, especially with a pregnant wife and young children. On the other hand, guests arriving might expect to be greeted, and not being acknowledged could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the parents felt that their arrival was ignored.\n\nThe author did tell his parents to let themselves in and mentioned they'd come down in half an hour. However, the parents might have expected a welcome or some form of acknowledgment when they arrived. The author didn't check in or say they were asleep, which could have led to misunderstanding. Also, the parents might have felt that not being greeted was a slight, even if the intention was to let the family rest.\n\nBut then again, the author's priority was his family's well-being, which is a valid concern. The parents were regular visitors, so maybe they understood the routine. However, in this case, the parents were upset, which suggests that their expectations weren't met. The author's communication might have been clear to him but not to the parents. Maybe he should have mentioned that the family was asleep and they would come down as soon as possible. The parents might have been more understanding if they knew the situation upfront.\n\nSo, the author's mistake could be in not being clear enough with his parents about why they weren't there immediately. He assumed they would understand the text message about coming down at 3, but that didn't convey the reason. If he had explained that the family was asleep and they would greet them when they could, the parents might not have been as upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate the situation properly, leading to the parents feeling disrespected. The intention was good, but the execution didn't consider the parents' feelings and expectations.\n"
