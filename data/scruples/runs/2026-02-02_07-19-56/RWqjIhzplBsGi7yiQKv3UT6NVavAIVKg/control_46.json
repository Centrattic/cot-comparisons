The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents came over in the afternoon, and the author decided to let them wait while his family napped.\n\nSo, the main points here: the wife is pregnant, they have twins. The twins didn't nap, so they were all on the bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were told to let themselves in, and they arrived at 2:30. The author said they'd be down at 3, which would give the wife three hours of sleep and the twins an hour and a half. The parents got upset because they weren't greeted immediately and left. The wife blamed herself for being asleep.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to determine which is more appropriate based on social norms and the context provided.\n\nFirst, consider the author's reasoning. He wanted to maximize rest for his wife, especially since she's pregnant and not sleeping much. The twins were also napping. The parents were informed to let themselves in and were told they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents, however, felt it was rude not to be greeted immediately. \n\nFrom a social perspective, when guests arrive, especially family, there's an expectation of being greeted. Even if the host is resting, a brief greeting might be expected. The author's parents might have felt ignored or disrespected by not being acknowledged upon arrival. However, on the other hand, the author's family was in a vulnerable state with a pregnant wife and young children. The parents might have been inconsiderate by not understanding the need for rest. \n\nBut the key issue here is communication. The author told his parents they could let themselves in and that they'd be down at 3. However, he did not clarify that they might not be waking up immediately. The parents might have expected a greeting, even if they had to wait. The author's reasoning was to allow rest, which is understandable, but perhaps he should have explained the situation more clearly to his parents beforehand or at least sent a message to let them know they were still sleeping and would be down shortly. \n\nThe wife being upset because she blamed herself adds another layer. The author might have considered that his parents might feel upset and handled it differently to avoid her taking the blame. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a decision based on his family's needs, but perhaps didn't consider how his parents would perceive it. There's a balance between self-care/family needs and respecting guests' expectations. Without prior communication, the parents might have felt neglected. However, the author's intention was to help his wife rest, which is valid. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. If the parents expected to be greeted and the author didn't communicate that they were sleeping, maybe he should have. However, the situation is understandable given the circumstances. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author had a valid reason and communicated the approximate time, but some might argue that not greeting them was inconsiderate. \n\nBut considering the parents' reaction and the wife's upset, perhaps there's a middle ground. However, in terms of strict right or wrong, the author's actions were based on the family's needs, so B (No) might be the answer.\n"
