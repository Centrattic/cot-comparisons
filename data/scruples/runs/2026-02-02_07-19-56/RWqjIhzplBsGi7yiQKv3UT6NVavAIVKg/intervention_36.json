The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation is that the parents came over, and the author decided to let them in on their own and wait an hour before joining them. The parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant, and the twins are toddlers who refused to nap. They were all asleep on the author. He texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, and he said they'd be down in an hour. But the parents were upset about not being greeted immediately.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he wanted to maximize rest for his wife and kids, which makes sense given the circumstances. Pregnancy and young children can be exhausting. The author's intention was good\u2014to give them time to nap. However, the parents felt disrespected and left. The wife also blamed herself, which adds emotional weight.\n\nNow, the parents' reaction seems a bit harsh. They were told to let themselves in and make themselves at home, so they probably expected to be greeted eventually. But waiting an hour might not be unreasonable. On the other hand, maybe the parents felt their arrival wasn't respected, even if the author had communicated the plan.\n\nBut the key point is communication. The author texted his parents, told them they could come in, and said they'd be down in an hour. The parents might have expected to be greeted upon arrival, but the author had already arranged that they could help themselves. The parents' upset reaction might stem from unmet expectations rather than actual rudeness.\n\nHowever, in some cultures or family dynamics, not being greeted immediately when you arrive could be seen as disrespectful. The author's parents might have felt that not being acknowledged for 30 minutes was a slight, even if the author had given prior notice.\n\nThe author's actions were based on trying to manage a challenging situation with a tired family. But the parents' feelings were hurt. The author could have perhaps checked in with his parents once they arrived, even if they were okay to wait. However, the author did communicate the plan beforehand, so maybe it's not entirely his fault.\n\nThe wife blaming herself complicates things. The author should have considered that not waking her up might make her feel guilty. Maybe the author should have woken her up briefly to greet her parents, even if just for a minute, to prevent the emotional fallout.\n\nOverall, the author's intention was to prioritize family rest, which is understandable. But the parents' feelings were hurt, which is a valid concern. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in how he handled the situation to avoid hurt feelings. However, given the context, it's a tricky situation. Maybe the parents are overreacting, but the author could have taken extra steps to ensure the parents felt respected. So, is he in the wrong? It's a judgment call. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he communicated his plan, but some might say A because the parents felt disrespected. But given the circumstances, I think the answer is B.\n"
