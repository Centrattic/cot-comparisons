The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. The situation is that the parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them to let themselves in and told them they'd be down at 3. The parents were upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins wouldn't nap, so they all ended up in bed, and eventually fell asleep. The author wanted to maximize their rest, especially since the wife isn't sleeping much. He thought 30 minutes for the parents to wait was okay because that's what they usually do.\n\nThe parents felt it was rude not to greet them immediately. The author tried to explain but they were upset. The wife was also upset, blaming herself.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the parents might feel disrespected by not being greeted promptly. They arrived and expected a greeting, maybe not realizing the situation. On the other hand, the author had a valid reason: family needs, especially with a pregnant spouse and young children. The twins not napping is a real challenge, and the author wanted to ensure rest for his wife, which is crucial during pregnancy.\n\nBut did the author communicate properly? He texted them to let themselves in and mentioned they'd be down at 3. Maybe the parents didn't expect to wait 30 minutes without any contact. Perhaps a call or a message to update them would have helped. The parents might have appreciated knowing that the family was resting and that it wasn't intentional neglect.\n\nThe wife being upset and blaming herself adds another layer. The author might have handled it differently, like having the parents wait in the living room without being disruptive. But considering the circumstances, the author's priority was family rest, which is understandable.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the situation. He had a legitimate reason, and 30 minutes isn't an unreasonable nap time. The parents' reaction might be overly sensitive. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
