The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents were upset because they felt ignored, but the author thought giving everyone time to nap was necessary given the wife's pregnancy and the twins' behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins refused to nap, leading to everyone sleeping in the parents' bed. The author decided to let them all sleep for three hours instead of waking them when his parents arrived. He texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, planning to meet them at 3. However, the parents felt it was rude not to wake them up immediately and left upset. The wife also felt guilty for being asleep.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I have to analyze if the author made a reasonable decision. On one hand, the family's exhaustion is understandable. The wife is pregnant and not sleeping well, and the twins are at a challenging age. Allowing them to rest could be seen as necessary for their health and well-being. On the other hand, the author didn't inform the parents about the situation properly, leading to the parents feeling snubbed. The parents might have expected a greeting or at least a notification that they were being kept waiting.\n\nThe key points are communication and expectations. The author assumed his parents would be okay waiting 30 minutes, but he didn't explain the family's situation. The parents might not have understood the context, leading to hurt feelings. The author could have sent a follow-up message explaining the reason for the delay, which might have softened the parents' reaction. Additionally, the wife's guilt suggests she felt the decision wasn't entirely the author's to make without consulting her.\n\nSo, considering both sides, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but the way he handled the communication with the parents was lacking. He should have explained the situation more clearly to avoid misunderstandings. However, the decision to let the family rest might be justified given their circumstances. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong, but with the note that better communication could have prevented the issue.\n"
