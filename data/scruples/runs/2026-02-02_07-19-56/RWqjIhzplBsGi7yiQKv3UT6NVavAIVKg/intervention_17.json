The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person didn't wake up their family when their parents came over. The wife is very pregnant, and they have twins who were refusing naps, so everyone ended up sleeping in bed. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them to let themselves in and that they'd come down at 3. The parents were upset and left, and the wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family was exhausted. The wife is pregnant, which can be very tiring, and the twins are young, so naps are important. The author wanted to maximize their rest time. On the other hand, the parents were invited over and expected to be greeted. Maybe they felt ignored or disrespected by not being let in immediately.\n\nThe author did text the parents to let themselves in, so maybe they were aware they'd be on their own. But when the parents arrived, the author was still asleep and didn't respond. The parents might have expected a more immediate greeting, especially since they were family. Even if the family was tired, maybe a quick greeting would have been possible. The parents might have felt that being left waiting and not being acknowledged was rude, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe wife is blaming herself, which adds to the emotional impact. The author's intention was good, but maybe the action of not waking up to greet the parents was seen as inconsiderate. The parents might have felt that their visit was not a priority, which could hurt their feelings. So, while the author had a good reason, the outcome caused upset. Is the author in the wrong? Maybe partly. They might have thought about the parents' feelings and perhaps found a way to balance both rest and a greeting, like waking up briefly to say hello even if they were still napping. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong."
