The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation is that they were all asleep in bed, and the parents came over, expecting to be greeted but were not. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, saying they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents felt upset and left.\n\nFirst, consider the parents' perspective. They came over expecting a welcome, maybe to spend time with their kids and grandkids. When they arrived and weren't greeted, they felt ignored or disrespected. The author's decision to let everyone nap was out of consideration for their well-being, especially with a pregnant wife and young children. However, communication might have been an issue. The author told his parents they'd come down at 3, but didn't mention that the family was asleep. The parents might not have realized that the family was unavailable, leading to misunderstanding. \n\nThe wife is pregnant and not sleeping well, so rest is important. The author tried to balance his parents' visit with his family's needs. However, the parents might have expected a different approach, like at least a quick greeting. The author's explanation might not have been sufficient in the moment. \n\nThe author's intention was good, but maybe he should have informed his parents that the family was asleep and they'd meet them later. Not informing them could be seen as neglecting their feelings. The parents might have appreciated a heads-up, even if they were upset. The wife's upset reaction is also a factor, as she might feel guilty for not being there. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to prioritize his family's rest. The parents might have overreacted, but the author's responsibility is to his immediate family's health. However, perhaps there's a middle ground, like a quick hello from the parents, even if the family was napping. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. His actions were well-intentioned, but maybe not communicated well. If he had told his parents they were asleep and would come down shortly, the parents might have been more understanding. The fact that he didn't mention the napping could be the issue. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not clarifying that they were all asleep when he told his parents to wait. Therefore, answer A.\n"
