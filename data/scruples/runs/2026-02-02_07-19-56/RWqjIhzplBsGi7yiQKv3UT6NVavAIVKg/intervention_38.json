The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation involves a pregnant wife, twins who didn't nap, and the parents coming over. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and said they'd come down after the family napped. The parents were upset and left, and the wife is blaming herself.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to let his family rest. The wife is pregnant and not sleeping well, so maximizing her rest makes sense. The twins were down for a nap, so keeping them asleep is reasonable. The parents were told to let themselves in and told they'd come down in an hour. The parents expected to be greeted immediately but were upset when it took longer. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, when guests arrive, it's customary to greet them promptly. Even if the host is busy, letting guests wait might be seen as rude. However, the author had a valid reason\u2014his family needed rest. The parents might not understand the stress and fatigue of a pregnant mother and young children. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author did inform his parents about the delay, but maybe the parents had different expectations. The author's actions were considerate towards his family's needs, but perhaps he didn't consider how the parents would feel waiting. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how the parents perceive their own importance in the situation. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the author isn't. It's a balance between family needs and guest etiquette. If the parents were understanding, they might have waited, but their reaction suggests they weren't. The author's intention was good, but maybe the execution could have been better, like explaining in more detail or setting clearer expectations. However, considering the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
