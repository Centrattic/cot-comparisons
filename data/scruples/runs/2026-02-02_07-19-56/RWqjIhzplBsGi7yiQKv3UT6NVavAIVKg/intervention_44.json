The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation involves a very tired wife who's pregnant and twins who didn't nap but ended up sleeping in the parents' bed. The husband texts his parents to let themselves in and wait until 3, which is an hour after they arrived at 2:30. The parents were upset and left, and the wife felt bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with the third child and already has twins who are almost two. The twins refused naps, leading to everyone sleeping in the parents' bed. The husband's intention was to let them rest, which is understandable, especially with the stress of pregnancy and young kids. He communicated with his parents to let themselves in and promised they'd come down at 3. The parents were upset they weren't greeted immediately. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and expectations. The husband texted his parents to let themselves in and told them they'd be down in 30 minutes. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the husband said they'd come down at 3. However, instead of waking the family, he let them sleep. The parents might have expected to be greeted upon arrival, which didn't happen, leading to their upset. \n\nOn one hand, the husband was trying to prioritize his family's rest, which is crucial in such a situation. On the other hand, the parents might have felt slighted or not respected because they weren't acknowledged when they arrived. The husband did communicate the time they'd be down, so he might not have been in the wrong for missing the initial arrival. However, maybe the expectation was that he should have woken up at least himself to greet them. \n\nBut given that the wife was asleep with the twins, it's challenging to do that. The husband was asleep too, as they all fell asleep on him. So waking up to greet the parents might not have been feasible. The parents might have a right to feel upset, but the husband's reasoning was to ensure his family got rest. \n\nIn terms of cultural norms, sometimes parents expect their children to be available for visits, especially when they come over. However, in this case, the husband did communicate the delay. The parents might have been in the wrong for getting upset when the plan was already communicated. \n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The husband's actions were to prioritize his family's health, and he did communicate the plan. The parents might have had unrealistic expectations. The answer could be B, not in the wrong, but there's a nuance. Alternatively, maybe the husband should have considered the parents' feelings more, hence A. But the main point is that he communicated the time, so maybe he's not wrong. \n\nI need to check if the husband's actions were reasonable. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the plan was to come down at 3. He didn't ignore their arrival message; he just followed through on the time. The parents might have felt ignored because they weren't greeted, but the husband was asleep with his family. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the husband made the plan clear and the parents might have overreacted.\n"
