The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. His wife is pregnant with baby number three, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins refused to nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents texted them when they arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd come down at 3. When they came down, the parents were upset about not being greeted and left angry. The wife is upset too.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's reasoning was to let his wife and kids nap because she's not sleeping much and they needed rest. He texted his parents to let themselves in and make themselves at home. But the parents felt ignored and left. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author had a valid reason\u2014his wife is pregnant and exhausted, the kids are young and needed naps. Prioritizing their rest makes sense, especially with a third child on the way. He communicated with his parents, told them they'd come down in 30 minutes, and that they could make themselves comfortable. That seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have felt disrespected. Even if they were told they could let themselves in, expecting to be greeted and perhaps not being aware that the family was napping could lead to misunderstanding. The parents might have arrived with certain expectations (like being welcomed immediately) that weren't met, leading to their upset reaction. The author didn't wake them up, but he did inform the parents of the time he'd be down. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key points are communication and expectations. The author did inform the parents they'd come down at 3. He gave them permission to let themselves in and eat. However, the parents might not have considered that the family was asleep. But the author's actions were to protect his wife's health and the kids' rest. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone arrives, it's customary to greet them. However, in this case, the family was asleep, and the author made an effort to maximize rest. The parents' reaction might be harsh, especially if they didn't consider the family's situation. The author's intentions were good. \n\nBut maybe the author could have checked in with his wife again before deciding not to wake them, or maybe set clearer expectations with his parents. However, given the context, it seems the author acted in a way that prioritized his family's health, which is important. The parents' reaction might be unreasonable given the explanation. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
