The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is at fault for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is very pregnant with their third child, and they have twins almost two years old. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd be down at 3, giving the wife and kids time to sleep. The parents got upset when they weren't greeted and left, and the wife blamed herself for being asleep.\n\nSo the main points are: the author prioritized rest for his family, especially the pregnant wife, over immediately greeting his parents. The parents felt disrespected and left. The wife felt bad about being asleep.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and expectations. In many families, especially close ones, there's an expectation that you'll be there when relatives visit. However, the author had a valid reason\u2014his wife is pregnant and sleep-deprived, the kids were overtired. He communicated their plan to his parents, so they knew when to expect them. The parents might have felt disrespected because they were kept waiting, even if it was intentional. But the author's intention was to allow rest, which is important for a pregnant woman and young children.\n\nIs there a wrong here? It depends on perspective. The author's actions were considerate towards his immediate family's needs. The parents' reaction might be due to feeling undervalued or not respected. However, the author did communicate their arrival time, so maybe the parents had a right to be upset about the delay. But in the context of a sleep-deprived, pregnant wife and young kids, the author's choice makes sense. The key is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since they communicated and had a valid reason, it might not be a wrong. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like not waiting an hour but allowing a shorter nap. But according to the scenario, the author's reasoning was to maximize rest, which is understandable. The parents' reaction is unfortunate, but the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
