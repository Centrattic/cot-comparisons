The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived.\n\nSo the setup is that the author's wife is very pregnant, and they have twins who aren't napping. They all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, so he texted them to let themselves in and told them to come at 2:30, saying they'd be down by 3. The parents were upset they weren't greeted and left. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author made a decision based on his wife's need for rest during pregnancy and the kids' naps. He thought it was best to let everyone sleep longer. But the parents felt disrespected because they weren't acknowledged when they arrived. The wife also felt bad because she was asleep when they came.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, he did inform his parents to let themselves in and gave a time when they'd be down. He had a valid reason related to his family's health and well-being. However, communication might have been an issue. Maybe he could have checked in with his parents during the half hour they waited? But he assumed they could wait, which they might have found rude.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be expecting immediate attention. But the author's priority was his family's rest. The wife's health during pregnancy is important, and the twins not napping could be a challenge. The parents left because they felt ignored, which is understandable from their perspective.\n\nThe key points are intention vs. perception. The author intended to help his family rest, but the parents perceived it as rudeness. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family expectations. However, in many cases, families with young children have flexibility. The author did communicate the time frame, so maybe he's not in the wrong. The parents might have needed to adjust their expectations. The wife's feelings are also a factor, but she might be blamed for not waking up earlier as well.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he made a conscious choice to prioritize his family's needs, communicated the plan, and the parents had prior knowledge. The parents might have misjudged the situation. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
