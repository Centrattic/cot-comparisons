The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents came over. The parents arrived at 2:30 PM, and the person told them they'd come down by 3 PM. The wife is pregnant, and the twins are napping. The parents were upset about not being greeted immediately and left. The wife blamed herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person wanted to maximize rest for their wife and twins since naps are crucial, especially with a pregnant wife. They communicated with their parents via text, telling them to let themselves in. The parents might have expected a greeting upon arrival, but the person thought a 30-minute wait was reasonable, given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have felt snubbed because they were left alone. Maybe they didn't know how to proceed without a greeting. The person could have considered their parents' feelings by offering an alternative, like joining them later once the family was ready. However, the parents' reaction seems harsh, given that it's a common situation where young families need rest. The person's intention was to prioritize family well-being, which is understandable.\n\nThe wife's upset reaction adds another layer. The person might have not considered that the wife would feel guilty. Maybe they should have involved her in the decision to delay the greeting. But the main issue is whether the delay was unreasonable. Since the parents were given access and could make themselves comfortable, the person didn't explicitly ignore them. The key is whether the 30-minute wait was too much. In many cases, people understand that families with young children need rest, so the answer might lean towards the person not being in the wrong.\n"
