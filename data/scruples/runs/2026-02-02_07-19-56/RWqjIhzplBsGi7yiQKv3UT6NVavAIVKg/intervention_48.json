The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by not waking their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The situation involves their wife being pregnant with their third child and having twins aged almost two. The twins refused to nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie, and they all fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon, so the user texted them to let themselves in and eat whatever. The parents arrived at 2:30 PM, and the user told them they'd come down at 3 PM, giving the family time to nap. The parents were upset about not being greeted immediately and left feeling stuffy and angry. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's main argument is that they wanted to maximize their wife's rest, especially given her pregnancy and the twins' nap resistance. However, the parents felt ignored or disrespected because they weren't greeted promptly. \n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, when someone is expected, especially family, there's an expectation of being greeted upon arrival. Even if the host is busy or tired, a polite acknowledgment is usually expected. The user's parents might have felt that not being greeted immediately was a snub, especially since they texted to confirm arrival. The user's response to wait an hour might have been seen as dismissive of their parents' presence.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's situation is challenging. Caring for a pregnant wife and young children is demanding. The user was trying to prioritize their family's well-being, which is understandable. However, in family interactions, especially with older relatives, there's a balance between self-care and respecting others' expectations. The user's decision to let everyone nap might have been the best option for their family's health, but the communication could have been better. Maybe they could have set clearer expectations earlier or had a backup plan if the nap didn't go as expected.\n\nThe wife's upset reaction adds another layer. She might have felt that her spouse didn't consider the parents' feelings, or she might have felt guilty for sleeping through their visit. The parents' reaction being \"stuffy and upset\" suggests they felt unappreciated or not valued. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. They prioritized their family's rest, which is important, but they might not have sufficiently considered the social expectations of hosting guests. The key points are communication and empathy. The user could have informed their parents more clearly about the situation or arranged for someone else to greet them, but since they chose not to, the parents felt neglected. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that the author is partially in the wrong because they didn't manage the expectations properly, leading to hurt feelings. However, the situation is complex, and stress from parenting young children is a valid factor. The main issue is the lack of communication and considering the parents' perspective when planning the naps.\n"
