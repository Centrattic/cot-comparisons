The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up his family when his parents arrived. The parents came over, the author texted them to let themselves in, and he told them they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, from the author's perspective, he wanted to let his wife and kids nap because they were exhausted. The wife is pregnant, and the twins are active. It makes sense he wanted them to rest. He communicated with his parents, told them the arrival time. So the intention was good.\n\nBut the parents felt ignored. They were told to let themselves in, but maybe they expected a greeting. The author didn't wake up his wife, so when they came down later, the parents were upset. The wife also felt blame. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, family dynamics can be tricky. On one hand, the author prioritized his family's rest, which is understandable. On the other, not acknowledging the parents' arrival could be seen as neglectful. The parents might have felt disrespected. However, the author did communicate the time they'd meet. \n\nBut maybe the parents felt they should be greeted promptly. The key is communication. The author set expectations by saying they'd come down at 3. If the parents respected that, they might not have been upset. But they were, so perhaps there's a cultural or personal expectation of immediate greeting. \n\nThe author's defense is that he was trying to help his wife and kids. However, not considering the parents' feelings might be a mistake. The author didn't ask if they were okay with waiting; he assumed they'd be fine. So maybe he should have checked in or made a brief appearance to greet them before napping. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention was good, but the action of completely ignoring the arrival might have been inconsiderate. The parents might have appreciated a quick greeting, even if the family was napping. So the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't account for the parents' need to feel welcomed immediately, despite the communication.\n"
