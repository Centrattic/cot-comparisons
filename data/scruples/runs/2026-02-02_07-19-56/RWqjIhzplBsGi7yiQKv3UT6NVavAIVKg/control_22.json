The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a husband whose wife is heavily pregnant and has twins who are almost two. The twins didn't want to nap, so the whole family ended up in bed watching a movie, and all of them fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon, and the husband texted them to let themselves in and make themselves at home. When they arrived at 2:30 PM, the husband told them they'd come down at 3 PM to let everyone nap. The parents were upset when the family didn't greet them immediately and left in a huff. The wife felt bad for being asleep. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and sleep-deprived, which is a significant factor. The twins are toddlers, and naptimes can be hit or miss. The husband's decision to let the family nap for an hour or so to maximize their rest makes sense because each parent is under a lot of stress. However, the parents expected to be greeted and felt ignored, which is understandable from their perspective. They might not have considered the family's exhaustion, especially with a newborn on the way.\n\nThe husband's communication was via text, which might not convey the urgency of the situation. He said they'd be down in 30 minutes, which he thought was enough time for the naps. But maybe the parents felt that if they had known earlier, they could have adjusted. Also, not waking up the wife and kids when they arrived could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the parents were expecting a welcome. The wife blaming herself adds another layer; she might feel that her absence was rude, even if the intention was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband was trying to be kind by allowing rest. It's a tough balance between personal needs and family obligations. The parents might have overreacted without understanding the circumstances. But the key here is that the husband didn't inform them beforehand that the family was sleeping and would be down shortly. Maybe a phone call or a note could have been better than just a text message.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help his family rest, but the execution might have been flawed. He didn't wake them up when they arrived, which could be seen as neglecting the social aspect. However, considering the wife's pregnancy and the kids' age, the need for rest is valid. The parents' reaction is harsh, but the husband's responsibility is to his immediate family. I think the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because the husband was prioritizing his family's well-being, but he could have handled the communication better. However, in the AITA context, sometimes intentions matter, but the parents felt disrespected. Maybe the wife's upset reaction also suggests that the husband should have found a way to make things better, but the main issue is whether he was wrong. I'm torn, but given the circumstances, I'd say B. The parents' expectations might not have been reasonable, and the husband's action was to help his family.\n"
