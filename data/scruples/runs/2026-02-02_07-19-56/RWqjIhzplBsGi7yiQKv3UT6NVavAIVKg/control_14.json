The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not waking up their wife and kids when their parents came over. The situation is that their wife is heavily pregnant, and they have twins who didn't nap, so everyone ended up sleeping in the parents' bed. The parents were supposed to come over in the afternoon, and the person told them to let themselves in and wait, planning to come down after everyone had a nap. The parents got upset and left, feeling ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They came over expecting to be greeted, but when they arrived, no one was there. They might feel disrespected because it's common to greet guests at least when they arrive. The author's reason was to let everyone rest, which makes sense given the situation with a pregnant wife and twins. However, maybe the parents didn't know about the current stress they were under. \n\nThe author did communicate that they'd be down in 30 minutes, but maybe the parents expected immediate greeting? Or maybe the 30 minutes wasn't enough? The parents might have felt ignored or not considered. The wife being upset and blaming herself adds another layer, suggesting that the family's needs were prioritized over the guests. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author was trying to take care of their family's health, especially the wife's sleep, which is crucial during pregnancy. The twins not napping would make the situation even more chaotic. The author's parents might not have been aware of how exhausted the family was. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have called the parents upon arrival to explain the situation and set expectations better. Texting them to let themselves in might not be the best approach. But the parents also might have a right to feel their visit wasn't respected. However, given the circumstances, prioritizing family rest could be understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a tough call. The intention was to let the family rest, which is valid, but the execution might have been lacking. Maybe they should have communicated more clearly or explained the situation when the parents arrived. But the parents' reaction seems harsh given the context. I think the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were looking out for their family's well-being, especially the wife's health. However, some might argue that guests should be greeted upon arrival. Since the author's reason was valid and the parents might not have known the full story, the answer is probably B.\n"
