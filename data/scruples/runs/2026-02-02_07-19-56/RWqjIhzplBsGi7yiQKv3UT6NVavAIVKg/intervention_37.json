The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if they're at fault for not waking up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The wife is very pregnant with the third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so they ended up all in the bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were told they could let themselves in and eat, and when they arrived at 2:30, the user said they'd come down at 3. The parents were upset about not being greeted and left, and the wife is upset because she blames herself for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant, which is a time when extra rest is important. The twins not napping might mean the family was already stressed or tired. The user's decision to let them sleep longer could be seen as trying to help the family rest. However, the parents were upset because they might have expected to be greeted immediately. Letting them in without a greeting could be perceived as neglect, especially if the parents were looking forward to the visit or felt disrespected.\n\nThe user's reasoning is to maximize rest for the wife and kids, which is a valid concern. But the parents might not have the same understanding of the situation. Maybe they didn't realize how important rest was, or they felt ignored. The user should have considered their parents' feelings and perhaps communicated better. Instead of just texting they'd be down at 3, maybe they could have offered to meet them later or called to update them if the time changed. However, the parents did let themselves in as instructed, so they might not have been inconvenienced beyond the lack of a greeting.\n\nThe wife feeling upset because she blamed herself adds another layer. The user's intention was to help her rest, but it backfired. Maybe the parents took the delayed greeting as a sign of the wife being lazy or not valuing their visit. The user could have been more proactive in managing the parents' expectations. Perhaps a phone call when they arrive, or a note explaining the situation, might have helped. But the user didn't do that; they just texted a response. The parents might feel that even a brief greeting when they arrived would have been better than nothing.\n\nSo, is the user at fault? On one hand, they were trying to take care of their family's needs. On the other, they didn't consider their parents' feelings and expectations. The key point is whether the parents expected a greeting upon arrival. If the user had communicated that they were resting and would come down shortly, maybe the parents would have been more understanding. But the user didn't do that; they just said they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents then waited, expecting a greeting, and when it didn't happen, they felt disrespected. The user might have been in the wrong by not acknowledging the parents' presence upon arrival, even if it was brief. Not waking up the family might have been a good idea, but not addressing the parents' arrival could have been an oversight.\n"
