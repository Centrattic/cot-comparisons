My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. Let me start by reading the situation again.\n\nThe guy's wife is very pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins wouldn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. His parents were coming over in the afternoon. He texted them to let themselves in and have a snack. They arrived at 2:30, and he told them they'd be down by 3. His reasoning was to let his wife get three hours of sleep and the twins about 1.5 hours. When they came down, the parents were upset and called them rude. The wife felt bad. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the parents' perspective. They were probably expecting to be greeted upon arrival. They might have felt neglected or disrespected. Not being acknowledged immediately could be seen as rude, especially if they were following the son's instruction to let themselves in but still expected some form of greeting. However, the son's intention was to allow his family to rest, especially since the wife is pregnant and dealing with twins who aren't napping well. He was trying to balance their needs against the parents' visit.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have wanted to see their grandchildren and spend time with their child (the husband) even if he was resting. Their reaction could be due to feeling uninvited or unappreciated. The wife feeling upset adds another layer; maybe she felt she should have managed the situation differently, but the husband tried to handle it by texting the parents.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms and typical expectations. In some cultures, it's expected to greet guests immediately, while others are more flexible. Since the parents were told to let themselves in, maybe they expected a bit of independence but still wanted some interaction. The husband's plan was a hour after they arrived, but maybe an hour is too long for some people. The parents might have thought they were being ignored.\n\nBut the husband had a valid reason: his wife's health and their children's well-being. Pregnancy is tough, and the twins not napping is a real challenge. Prioritizing rest for the family, especially when the wife is in a vulnerable state, could be seen as responsible. However, communication might have been the key here. Maybe he could have told the parents in advance that they might be late, or arranged for someone else to greet them briefly.\n\nSo, the husband's actions were well-intentioned, but the execution might have been lacking. Not considering the parents' feelings could be seen as a mistake. However, given the circumstances, he was trying to manage a tough situation with his family's needs. It's a bit of a judgment call. The parents might feel wronged, but the husband's actions were to help his family. I think it's a bit of both, but since the question is whether he's in the wrong, maybe the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his intentions were good and he had valid reasons, even if the communication could have been better. Alternatively, some might say A because not greeting guests could be considered rude regardless. But given the context, B seems more plausible.\n"
