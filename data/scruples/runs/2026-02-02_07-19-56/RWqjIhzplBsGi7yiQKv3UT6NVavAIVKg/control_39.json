The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not waking their family up when their parents arrived. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the situation: The user's wife is very pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins wouldn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the user told them to let themselves in and they'd come down at 3, since they arrived at 2:30. The parents got upset because they felt ignored and left because they were mad.\n\nFirst, the main points here are the family's need for rest. The wife is pregnant and not sleeping well, so the user wanted to maximize her sleep. The twins are young and hard to put down for naps. It's a tough time for them. The user's intention was to let everyone rest, which seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe parents, on the other hand, expected to be greeted when they arrived. They might feel that not being acknowledged immediately is rude, especially if they're not used to it. But the user had communicated ahead of time that they'd come down at 3. Maybe the parents thought the user was ignoring them once they arrived, but the user's plan was to let the family nap. \n\nThe wife blamed herself, which adds to the emotional impact. The user's reasoning is that they were trying to take care of their family's needs, considering the wife's health and the kids' schedules. The parents might not have considered the user's stress and the challenges of having multiple young children.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user did inform the parents of the plan. The parents didn't follow up on the arrival, perhaps expecting immediate attention. The user's action was to prioritize family rest, which is a common need in such situations. \n\nBut maybe the user could have checked in with the parents earlier, or left a note in case the parents felt neglected. However, the user's main goal was to let the family rest, which they communicated. The parents' reaction seems harsh given the context. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. Their actions were based on the family's needs and they communicated the plan. The parents' expectations might not have aligned with the user's situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
