The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents were upset and left. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's wife is heavily pregnant, and they have twins who were refusing naps. They all ended up sleeping in the bed. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them to let themselves in, saying they'd come down by 3. The parents were upset about not being greeted immediately. \n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's reasoning was to let the family rest, especially the wife who isn't sleeping much. But the parents felt ignored or disrespected. The author didn't wake them up even though they had arrived. The wife felt bad about being asleep.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to help the family get rest. They communicated with the parents, letting them know they'd come down in 30 minutes. Maybe the parents expected immediate attention. On the other hand, the parents might have felt that waiting 30 minutes without any communication or greeting was rude. However, the author did communicate the plan in advance. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation about guests arriving and being greeted immediately? In some cultures, that's important. The author's parents might have expected to be met at the door, leading to their upset. But the author had a valid reason related to family needs. The wife was pregnant and needed rest. The twins were young and needed naps. \n\nThe wife blamed herself, which shows that maybe the parents' reaction affected the family's emotions. The author should have considered how his parents might react and perhaps found a way to balance their needs with the family's rest. Maybe he could have had a family member wake up to greet them briefly before going back to sleep. But the author didn't do that. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on intentions and consequences. The intention was good, but the consequence was that the parents felt disrespected. The author might not be in the wrong because he had a valid reason and communicated the plan. However, not considering the parents' feelings could be a point against him. \n\nBut the parents were given a clear timeline (30 minutes) and were told to make themselves at home. If they were upset after that wait, maybe that's on them. The author's actions were to prioritize his family's health and well-being, which is understandable. The parents might be being overly sensitive. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have had someone else greet them. If he didn't wake his wife, maybe he could have woken up briefly to say hello. But the twins were also asleep. The author might have thought that 30 minutes was enough. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were in the best interest of his family, and he communicated the plan. The parents' reaction might be justified in their perspective, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because he acted with good intentions and communicated the plan, even if the parents were upset.\n"
