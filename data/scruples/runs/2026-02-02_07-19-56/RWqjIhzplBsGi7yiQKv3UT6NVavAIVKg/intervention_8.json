The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived, even though he had texted them to let themselves in. The parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins refused to nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The husband told his parents they could come over and make themselves at home, saying they'd come down at 3, giving his wife and the twins time to nap. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited until 3, and then left upset because they felt ignored.\n\nThe husband's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife and kids. His parents left upset, and the wife blamed herself. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, the husband's intention was to let his family rest, especially since the wife is pregnant and the kids are young. It's understandable that they need sleep. He did tell the parents to let themselves in and eat, so maybe he expected them to be okay waiting a bit. However, the parents might have expected to be greeted and acknowledged when they arrived. Leaving them to wait alone for 30 minutes without any communication might have been seen as neglectful, even if the intention was good.\n\nAnother angle: the parents arrived at 2:30 and were waiting until 3. The husband told them they'd come down at 3. But maybe the parents wanted a greeting as soon as they arrived. Not letting them in and not even greeting them could be perceived as rude, especially if they were expecting to be welcomed. The husband might have assumed the parents would be okay waiting, but from the parents' perspective, it could have felt like their arrival wasn't respected.\n\nThe wife was upset because she blamed herself. That suggests that maybe the husband should have considered his wife's feelings. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was hurt feelings on both sides. So, was it wrong to not wake them up? It's a tough call. The husband's actions were to protect his family's rest, which is understandable, but not acknowledging the parents' arrival immediately might have been inconsiderate.\n\nI think there's a middle ground here. The husband could have woken up his wife and kids at least enough to greet the parents for a few minutes, then go back to sleep. Alternatively, he could have checked in with the parents via text during the wait to let them know they were on their way. But he didn't do either. So maybe the husband didn't consider the parents' feelings and assumed they would be fine waiting. That's where the mistake might be. The parents might need some interaction, even if the family isn't fully ready. So the answer is likely A, he is in the wrong, because he didn't consider the parents' perspective and his actions led to their upset.\n"
