The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The wife is pregnant, they have twins, and everyone was asleep. The parents came over and were upset because they had to wait.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant and not sleeping much, so the husband wanted to let her rest. The parents were told to let themselves in and eat. They arrived at 2:30 and the husband said they'd come down at 3, expecting the parents to wait. But the parents were upset and left.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the parents might feel disrespected by having to wait. On the other, the husband was trying to prioritize his family's rest, especially since the wife is pregnant. \n\nCommunication is key here. The husband texted the parents to let themselves in and mentioned they'd be down at 3. The parents might have expected a greeting immediately. The husband might have assumed they'd wait, but maybe he should have clarified that they would come down after the naps. Also, the parents might have felt ignored or unimportant. However, given the circumstances of the wife's exhaustion and the twins being toddlers, the husband's decision to prioritize rest could be seen as reasonable.\n\nBut, maybe the husband could have found a middle ground. Instead of waiting until exactly 3, perhaps he could have checked in with the parents after 20-30 minutes to see if they needed anything. That might have made the parents feel acknowledged. However, the parents did say they often watch TV there, so they might have been okay waiting. \n\nThe wife's upset reaction suggests that the parents' visit was important, but the husband's decision was to help her rest. It's a balance between family obligations and personal needs. In some cultures, respecting elders is very important, so the parents' reaction might be more about that. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because he communicated his plan and the parents had agreed to let themselves in. However, maybe he could have been more proactive in ensuring the parents felt welcome. But given the situation, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
