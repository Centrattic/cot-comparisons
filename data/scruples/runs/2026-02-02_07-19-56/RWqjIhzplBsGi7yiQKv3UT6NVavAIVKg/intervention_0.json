The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not waking up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. \n\nFirst, the context: The person's wife is very pregnant, and they have twins who aren't napping. They all ended up sleeping in the bed together. The parents are coming over, so the person texts them to let themselves in. They arrive at 2:30 and the person says they'll come down at 3, giving the family more time to nap. The parents felt it was rude not to greet them and left upset. The wife also felt bad about being asleep.\n\nHmm, the key points here are communication and consideration. The person tried to explain their reasoning, but the parents didn't appreciate the delay. Maybe the issue is that the parents were expecting immediate attention. The person thought they were being considerate by letting everyone rest, especially the wife, but perhaps they didn't consider how the parents would feel waiting alone. \n\nThe parents might have felt neglected or unimportant, especially if they were used to being greeted upon arrival. Also, the wife feeling guilty suggests that maybe the person could have involved her more in the decision, but she was asleep. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they had a good intention to let the family rest, but maybe didn't account for the parents' expectations. Maybe there's a balance between self-care and respecting others' needs. The answer might depend on cultural norms or how the parents usually interact. However, in many cases, guests might expect to be greeted promptly. So the author might be in the wrong here for not considering that the parents wanted to be welcomed immediately, even if it meant waking up their family. \n\nBut on the other hand, the parents might have been too rigid. The answer could be A because the author didn't communicate the importance of the naps to the parents, leading to misunderstandings. Alternatively, maybe it's B because the author was prioritizing their family's health, which is important. \n\nWait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The main issue is not waking the parents when they arrived. The parents wanted to be greeted, which is a social expectation. The person's reasoning is valid, but the execution might have been flawed. If they had let the parents wait in a different area or checked in with them while the family napped, that could have been better. Since they didn't communicate that they were asleep and needed time, it might come off as rude. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
