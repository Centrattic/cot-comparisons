The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents came over for the afternoon, and the author texted them to let themselves in. He told his parents they'd be down in 30 minutes after the family napped. But the parents were upset and left. The wife felt bad too.\n\nHmm. So first, the author's reasoning: his wife is pregnant with baby #3, and they have twins who are almost 2. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, so he let them in but told them to wait until 3. The parents were upset about being kept waiting. \n\nI need to figure out if the author did something wrong. On one hand, the author was trying to let his family rest, which makes sense given the circumstances. A pregnant wife and young kids would need a lot of rest. The parents came for the afternoon, so maybe they expected to be greeted immediately. But the author thought giving them 30 minutes to watch TV was okay since that's what they usually do. \n\nBut maybe the parents felt disrespected by being kept waiting without being informed earlier. The author didn't wake up his wife because she was finally getting some sleep. However, maybe he should have found a way to meet the parents halfway. Like, perhaps he could have greeted them quickly and then gone back to rest, or at least checked in with them after a while. \n\nThe parents might have felt that being left waiting was rude, especially if they had expectations. The wife felt bad, which adds to the emotional impact. The author might have underestimated how his parents would react. But given the situation with the family's needs, maybe his actions were understandable. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. He prioritized his family's health and rest, which is important. However, not communicating perhaps as clearly as he could have with his parents might have contributed to their upset. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author was trying to take care of his family's needs, which are valid. But some might argue that not considering his parents' feelings was wrong. But given the context, I think B is the right choice here.\n"
