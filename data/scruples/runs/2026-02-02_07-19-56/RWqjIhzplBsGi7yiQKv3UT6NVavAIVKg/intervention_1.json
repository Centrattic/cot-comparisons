The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not waking up his family when his parents arrived. The scenario involves a pregnant wife, twins, and the parents coming over. The author decided to let everyone nap instead of waking them up immediately.\n\nFirst, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife and kids, especially since the wife isn't sleeping much. He texted parents to let themselves in, which he did. He estimated they would come down after 30 minutes, but parents were upset they weren't greeted right away. The parents left upset, and the wife felt bad.\n\nOn one hand, the author was considering his family's well-being, ensuring they got needed rest. On the other hand, the parents might have expected an immediate greeting. However, the author did communicate in advance, telling them to let themselves in and that they'd come down at 3. Parents arrived at 2:30 and the author kept their promise by being down at 3. The parents might have felt disrespected because they were not immediately greeted, but the author had a valid reason.\n\nIs there a cultural or social expectation here? In some contexts, expecting guests to wait 30 minutes might be seen as impolite. But the author didn't ignore them; he kept the appointment. The parents' reaction might be overblown. The wife's upset feelings also play a role, but she was asleep due to the author's decision. However, the author could have checked in with parents during the wait, maybe to reassure them. But he might not have been able to do that if he was asleep with everyone else.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. He prioritized his family's health, which is important, especially with a pregnant wife and young kids. He made a plan and followed it. The parents' reaction is a problem too. The answer might depend on whether the parents' expectations were unreasonable. If the author thought 30 minutes was acceptable and communicated that, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the parents were expecting immediate greeting, then maybe there's a breach of etiquette. However, given the circumstances, the author's actions seem reasonable. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
