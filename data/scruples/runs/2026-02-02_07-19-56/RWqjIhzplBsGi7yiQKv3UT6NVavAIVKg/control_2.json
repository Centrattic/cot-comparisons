The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation involves a pregnant wife, twins who wouldn't nap, and the parents coming over.\n\nFirst, the parents were told to let themselves in and were informed they'd come down at 3. The author decided to let everyone sleep for a bit longer. The parents arrived at 2:30, waited until 3, but then left upset. They felt it was rude not to be greeted immediately. The wife felt guilty for being asleep.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author texted the parents to let themselves in and mentioned they'd be down at 3. The parents might have expected a greeting upon arrival, but the author's plan was to let everyone nap. The parents might not have considered that the family was in a tough situation with the twins not napping. On the other hand, the author could have checked in with his parents to see if they were okay waiting, or maybe set clearer expectations. However, the author did follow through with the time he gave them. The parents' reaction might be harsh given the circumstances. The author's intention was to help his wife get rest, which is understandable. The blame on the wife for being asleep is also a point where the author could have handled it better, but the main question is about the author's actions. Since he communicated the plan and followed through, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But maybe there's room for improvement in how he handled the parents' expectations.\n"
