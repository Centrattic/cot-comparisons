The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived, leading to the parents being upset and leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins wouldn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. The author planned to come down in an hour to give the wife and kids more rest. The parents arrived, texted him, and he told them they'd be down in 30 minutes. But the parents were upset about not being greeted immediately and left, with the wife feeling guilty.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The main points are the well-being of his family versus his parents' expectations. The wife is pregnant and not sleeping well, so rest is important. The twins are young and also need naps. The author tried to accommodate both his family's needs and his parents' visit by giving the family time to rest first. However, the parents felt disrespected because they weren't greeted upon arrival, which is a common social norm. \n\nBut the author's reasoning was to prioritize his wife's and kids' rest, which makes sense given their situation. The parents might have expected a greeting, but the author communicated that they would come down later. The parents might have overreacted, especially since they left, which could indicate they were too sensitive. The wife's guilt suggests that maybe the parents' reaction made her feel bad, but the author's intention was to help her rest.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, intentions matter a lot. The author's intention was to take care of his family's needs, which is understandable. The parents might not have considered the family's situation, especially with the wife being pregnant. So, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The parents might have been too harsh in their response. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
