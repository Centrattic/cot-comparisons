The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents were upset, and the wife blamed herself. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed. The author texted the parents to let themselves in and said they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the plan was to let everyone rest until 3. The parents felt it was rude not to greet them.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the parents were upset because they felt snubbed. But the reason given is to allow the wife and kids to rest, which is understandable, especially with a newborn coming. The author tried to explain, but the parents were still angry. The wife was upset too, maybe feeling guilty for being asleep.\n\nOn one hand, maybe the parents expected a greeting. But the author communicated they'd be down in 30 minutes. The parents could have waited that half-hour. However, maybe the parents didn't want to wait or felt disrespected. It's possible the author should have considered the parents' feelings more. Alternatively, given the family situation, the author was trying to be considerate of his wife's needs, which might be justified.\n\nBut in social situations, guests might expect some form of greeting. If the author knew the parents were coming over, maybe he should have made sure they were greeted even if it meant waking up the family a bit earlier. However, the parents were told to let themselves in and eat, so maybe they were okay with that. Still, not greeting them in person could be seen as rude. The author's reasoning is valid, but the parents' feelings are also important. It's a balance between family needs and respecting guests. Maybe the author isn't entirely at fault, but perhaps there's a middle ground. However, the parents left angry, which is a problem. The answer might be a mix, but the options are A or B. Since the author had a good reason but the parents felt wronged, maybe it's a judgment call. I think the author isn't in the wrong because the intention was to help the family rest, which is a valid reason. The parents might need to be more understanding. So the answer would be B.\n"
