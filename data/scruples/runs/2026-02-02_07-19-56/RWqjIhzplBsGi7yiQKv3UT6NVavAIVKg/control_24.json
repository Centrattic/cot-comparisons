The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The author's wife is very pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't want to nap, so the whole family ended up in bed watching a movie, and everyone fell asleep. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat whatever. The parents arrived at 2:30 PM, and the author told them they'd come down by 3 PM to give the family time to nap. The parents were upset that they weren't greeted immediately and left feeling offended. The wife felt bad because she was asleep.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the wife's health and the kids' needs. Being pregnant with a third child and having twins is a lot. Sleep deprivation is common in such situations, especially with young kids. The author probably wanted to prioritize their rest. The parents, on the other hand, might have expected a greeting upon arrival, as is customary in many cultures. The author's intention was to let everyone nap, which seems reasonable given their circumstances. However, the parents felt ignored or disrespected, which is a valid feeling even if the author's reasoning was sound.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents were expecting to be greeted, and the author didn't communicate clearly about the delay. Maybe the parents didn't realize the urgency of the family's need for rest. The author could have called to explain instead of just texting a time, which might have set expectations better. But the parents also might have been too strict about the timing. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given their situation. The author had a valid reason to let the family rest, and the parents' reaction seems harsh. However, maybe the author could have handled the communication better. But the main fault isn't necessarily on the author. They were trying to take care of their family's needs, which is a primary responsibility. The parents might need to understand the challenges of having a large young family. So, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's room for both perspectives. But given the scenario, the author's intent was to help the family rest, which is understandable.\n"
