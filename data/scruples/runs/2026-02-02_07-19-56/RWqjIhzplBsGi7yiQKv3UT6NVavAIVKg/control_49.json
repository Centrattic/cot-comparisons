The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived.\n\nSo, the key points here: The wife is heavily pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie, and everyone fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author told them to let themselves in and that they'd come down in an hour. But when they arrived, the family was still asleep. The parents got upset and left, and the wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. He wanted to maximize rest for his wife and kids since the wife isn't sleeping well. The parents were told in advance that they'd come down later. They arrived and expected to be greeted immediately, but the author didn't wake them up. The parents felt it was rude, but the author's intention was to let the family rest.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe. Parents visiting might expect some kind of greeting, even if it's brief. However, the author did communicate in advance that they'd come down later. The parents might have taken it as a promise to be ready when they arrived, but the author's reasoning is understandable given the circumstances. The wife is pregnant, and the kids are young, so rest is crucial. The parents might have overreacted, but the author could have handled it differently. Perhaps he should have checked in with his parents, or had someone else greet them briefly. Maybe the parents felt disrespected because they weren't acknowledged upon arrival, even if the author had a good reason. On the other hand, the author was trying to prioritize his family's well-being. It's a bit of a grey area. Depending on cultural expectations and the parents' usual behavior, the author might not be entirely wrong. However, not considering the parents' feelings could be a mistake. The answer might be B (No) because the author had a valid reason and communicated his plan, but there's a case for A if the parents felt ignored. Still, given the context, B seems more likely.\n"
