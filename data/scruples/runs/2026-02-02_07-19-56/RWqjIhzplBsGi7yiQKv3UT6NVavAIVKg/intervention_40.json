The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived, even though he had texted them to let themselves in. The parents got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife is pregnant with baby #3 and has twins who are almost 2. They didn't nap, so everyone ended up sleeping in bed. The husband texted the parents to come over, telling them to let themselves in and that they'd be down in an hour. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the family was still asleep. When they came down, the parents were upset because they felt ignored or not greeted. The wife blamed herself.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Now, I need to evaluate both sides. The husband tried to maximize rest for his wife and kids, which makes sense given their situation. However, he didn't check back with his parents after they arrived. He assumed they could wait, but maybe he should have called or texted to confirm they were okay. The parents might have felt disrespected because they were left waiting without a greeting. The husband's explanation is valid, but maybe he didn't communicate well enough. Did he give them a timeframe or just say they'd be down in an hour? Also, maybe the parents had specific plans or expectations that weren't met. The wife's upset reaction adds to the tension. \n\nIn some cases, parents might have been more understanding, but it's possible the husband didn't consider their perspective. The key is whether not waking up to greet them was considered rude. Since the parents were upset, it might be seen as the husband's fault for not ensuring they were comfortable during the wait. But on the other hand, the husband was taking care of his family's needs. It's a tough call. The answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. If the husband had communicated properly and ensured the parents were fine waiting, maybe he's not in the wrong. But since they were upset, maybe he should have checked in to make sure they weren't waiting alone for too long. So, I'm leaning towards AITA being the husband, so answer A.\n"
