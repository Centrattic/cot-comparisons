The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents came over. The parents were upset because they felt ignored. The author's reasoning was that his wife is pregnant and needed rest, and the twins had just fallen asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. He wanted to maximize rest for his wife and the twins because they were already exhausted. He texted his parents to let themselves in and even gave a time when they'd be down. The parents arrived at 2:30 and were told they'd come down by 3. But they were upset that they weren't greeted immediately and left feeling insulted.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The author did communicate the plan, but maybe the expectations of his parents weren't aligned. Parents might expect a greeting when they arrive, even if the family is resting. However, the author's actions were to allow necessary rest, which is understandable, especially with a pregnant spouse and young children. The parents might not have considered the family's state and might have interpreted the delay as rudeness rather than a need for rest.\n\nAnother angle is that the author could have checked in with his parents after they arrived, maybe through a quick message or phone call, to let them know everything was okay and that they'd come down soon. But he did inform them they could make themselves comfortable and eat. However, the parents might not have wanted to be left alone for 30 minutes.\n\nThe wife was upset, blaming herself, which adds emotional weight. The author's intention was caring for his family's needs, but the parents felt disrespected. It's a balance between respecting one's own family's needs and others' expectations. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a difference between being considerate and being considerate to others. The author might have done the right thing for his family, but not communicated well enough with his parents. Alternatively, the parents might have overreacted given the context of a busy family situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the parents were given clear instructions to let themselves in and the family was in a situation where rest was crucial, maybe not. But the parents might have expected a warmer welcome. The author's actions were based on the family's needs, but perhaps he could have checked in briefly or adjusted the time. However, the parents' reaction seems harsh, considering the circumstances. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with some nuances.\n"
