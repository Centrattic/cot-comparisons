The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether not waking up the wife and kids when parents arrived is wrong. The user thinks the author is at fault but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: the wife is very pregnant and the twins were already sleeping. They didn't want to wake them up, so they let the parents in but waited an hour to come down. The parents were upset and left, making the wife feel bad.\n\nThe parents probably felt disrespected because they were told to let themselves in but weren't greeted. Even if the author meant to give everyone rest, the parents might have expected a greeting. The author didn't communicate clearly. Maybe they should have had the parents wait by the door or at least come down briefly to greet them before going back upstairs. The parents might have felt ignored, especially since they were told to just let themselves in without any prior arrangement. The wife's upset reaction also shows the emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents should have considered the family's situation. Maybe they were in a hurry or expected a different kind of visit. But the author's main mistake was not addressing the parents' arrival properly. Letting them in without any contact is one thing, but waiting an hour without communication could be seen as neglecting their presence. The parents might have felt their visit was not respected.\n\nSo, the author didn't handle the communication well. They could have gone down even briefly to greet and explain the situation, then returned. That might have prevented the parents from feeling ignored. The parents' reaction is valid, but the author could have been more proactive in managing the situation. Therefore, the author is partly at fault.\n"
