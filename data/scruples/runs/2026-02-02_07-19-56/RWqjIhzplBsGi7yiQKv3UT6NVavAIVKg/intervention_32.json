The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves the author not waking up their wife and kids when their parents arrived.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant with their third child and there are twins almost two years old. The twins didn't nap, so they all ended up in bed. The author texted the parents to let themselves in and said they'd be down in 30 minutes. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the family came down at 3. The parents were upset about not being greeted immediately and left.\n\nThe author's reasoning was to let the wife and twins nap. The parents felt it was rude. The wife was upset too. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions were reasonable. The parents were told to let themselves in, so maybe the expectation was to come in immediately. However, the author gave a specific time frame. The parents might have expected a greeting upon arrival. But the author was trying to accommodate the family's need for rest, especially with a pregnant wife. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting the parents' expectations and the needs of the family. The parents might not have considered the family's situation. However, the author could have checked in with the parents earlier or had a better communication plan. Not waking the family might have been considerate of their needs, but not informing the parents clearly led to hurt feelings.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong. They tried to manage the situation with the family's well-being in mind. However, there's room for better communication. The parents' expectations might not have been clearly communicated either. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
