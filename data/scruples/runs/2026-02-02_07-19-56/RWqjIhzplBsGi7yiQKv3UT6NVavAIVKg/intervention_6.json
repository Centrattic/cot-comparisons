The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: the wife is heavily pregnant, they have twins who refused naps, so they all ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over, and the author told them to let themselves in and that they'd be down in an hour. The parents arrived at 2:30 PM, and the author planned for the family to nap until 3:30 PM. The parents were upset about not being greeted and left. The wife felt guilty for being asleep.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning was to maximize rest for his family, especially the pregnant wife. His parents, however, felt disrespected and left because they had to wait and weren't greeted. The key points here are the communication, the parents' expectations, and the wife's health.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, guests are expected to be greeted upon arrival, and delaying the greeting can be seen as impolite. However, the author had a valid reason due to the family's circumstances. The parents might not have been aware of the situation, so maybe there was a miscommunication. The author did text them to let themselves in and mentioned they'd be down in an hour, which might have been insufficient or unclear. \n\nThe wife's health is important, especially with a third child on the way. The author might have prioritized her rest correctly. But from the parents' perspective, waiting over an hour without being informed of the delay could be frustrating. The author could have checked in with his parents during the wait or provided more explanation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. He had a good intention to help his wife, but the execution might have been poor. Not informing the parents properly or not considering their feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. Alternatively, prioritizing a family member's health is understandable. The parents' reaction might be harsh, but the author's responsibility is to his family. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. If the author had communicated the situation better and managed expectations, it might have been handled better. But given the circumstances, it's possible he wasn't in the wrong. However, the answer might lean towards A because the parents were upset, but maybe there's a middle ground. I'm a bit conflicted here. The wife's health is a strong point, but the parents' feelings matter too. Maybe the author should have found a middle ground, like having the parents wait a bit but still greeting them eventually. Since he didn't, maybe he's at fault.\n"
