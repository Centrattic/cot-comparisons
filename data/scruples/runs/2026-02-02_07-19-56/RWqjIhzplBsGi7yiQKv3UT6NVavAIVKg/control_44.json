The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived, thinking they needed rest. The parents were upset and left. The wife was also upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is pregnant with their third child, and they have twins. That's a lot of demands on their time and energy. The twins refused to nap, so everyone ended up in bed together. The author decided to let them sleep while the parents were there, thinking it would help his wife get more rest. \n\nOn one hand, the parents were expecting to be greeted and maybe felt disrespected by not being let in immediately. They might have felt ignored or unappreciated. But on the other hand, the author's reasoning was to prioritize the family's need for rest, especially the pregnant wife. It's a common situation where new or expecting parents need as much sleep as possible. \n\nThe parents might not have considered the family's exhaustion. The author did inform them they'd come down in 30 minutes, but maybe the parents expected more immediate attention. However, the author did communicate the plan and gave a timeframe. The parents still left upset, which might be their own issue, but the author's intention was to help the family. \n\nThe wife blamed herself, which adds another layer. The author might not have realized how his decision affected her feelings. But considering the context, it's a tough situation. I think the author isn't in the wrong because he made a decision based on the family's needs. The parents might need to be more understanding of the family's current stress and demands. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
