The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. The situation involves a very tired pregnant wife, twins who are hard to nap, and the parents coming in without being greeted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, planning to come down after the family napped. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd come down at 3. The parents were upset about not being greeted and left. The wife blamed herself.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to prioritize rest over greeting the parents. On one hand, the wife is pregnant, the twins are young and not cooperating with naps, and the author wanted to maximize rest. On the other hand, the parents might have expected a greeting upon arrival, especially since they were guests.\n\nCultural norms and expectations about hospitality might play a role here. In some cultures, guests are expected to be met and greeted immediately. However, the author did communicate in advance that they might be delayed, which shows consideration. The parents might have felt disrespected because they were not acknowledged upon arrival, even if they were told to let themselves in.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was to allow his family to rest, which is understandable given the circumstances. The parents' reaction might be based on not understanding the situation or feeling ignored. The wife's upset feelings add another layer, but she wasn't the one who chose to let the parents in; the author did.\n\nI need to weigh the author's actions against the parents' expectations. The author made a judgment call based on his family's needs, communicated his plan, and the parents still felt wronged. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether respecting the family's rest is more important than immediate hospitality. Since the parents left upset, maybe the author should have considered their perspective more, but given the context of a pregnant wife and young children, it's a tough call.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he made a decision based on his family's needs and communicated it, but there's a nuance here. The parents' feelings are valid too, but the author's actions seem reasonable under the circumstances.\n"
