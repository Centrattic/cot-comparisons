The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't wake up his family when his parents arrived, leading to the parents being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is heavily pregnant, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins refused to nap, so the whole family ended up in bed together, all falling asleep. The parents arrived, and the author texted them to let themselves in and eat. He told the parents they'd be down in 30 minutes, but the parents were upset they weren't greeted immediately.\n\nThe author's reasoning was to let the wife and kids nap to maximize rest, especially since the wife isn't sleeping much. The parents left upset, and the wife blamed herself. \n\nSo, the key points here are about balancing family needs with parental expectations. On one hand, the author was trying to prioritize his family's well-being, especially with the wife's health and the twins' behavior. On the other hand, the parents might have felt disrespected by not being greeted upon arrival, which is a common social expectation.\n\nI should think about societal norms. Usually, guests expect to be greeted promptly. However, the author had a valid reason related to family circumstances. The parents might not have considered the stress of having a third child on the way and managing twins. \n\nThe wife's upset reaction also plays a role. She blamed herself, which adds to the emotional impact. The author's decision might have been well-intentioned, but maybe the parents felt their feelings were overlooked. \n\nIt's possible that the author should have communicated better with his parents beforehand, explaining the situation so they understood the importance of the naps. But since he did text them to let themselves in and said they'd be down in 30 minutes, maybe that was sufficient. \n\nHowever, the parents' reaction was strong, and they left feeling stuffy and upset. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps there's room for improvement in handling such situations. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because he made a conscious decision to prioritize his family's health, which is a valid concern. But it's also possible that he could have managed expectations better with his parents. \n\nBut the main question is whether he is in the wrong. If the parents' upset reaction is based on social etiquette, but the author's actions were for a good reason, then maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
