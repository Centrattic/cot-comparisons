The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the person didn't wake their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The parents were upset because they felt ignored.\n\nFirst, the author texted their parents to let themselves in and eat, and said they'd be down in 30 minutes. The parents arrived at 2:30, and the author told them they'd come down at 3, giving their wife and kids time to nap. The parents got upset and left, and the wife was upset too.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. The main points are: the wife is pregnant and not sleeping well, the twins were already asleep. The author tried to maximize rest. But the parents felt disrespected because they weren't greeted. \n\nOn one hand, the author was trying to be considerate to their family, especially the wife's health. On the other hand, maybe they should have communicated better with their parents. The parents might have expected a greeting upon arrival. Not informing them that they arrived and not coming down immediately could be seen as rude. \n\nBut the author did text them to let themselves in and said they'd be down in half an hour. Maybe the parents didn't expect waiting 30 minutes. The author might have assumed the parents would understand, but maybe they didn't consider the parents' feelings. \n\nThe wife blaming herself adds another layer. The author didn't wake her, so maybe they should have considered that the wife might feel guilty even if she wasn't. \n\nHmm. It's a balancing act between family needs and respecting guests. The author's intention was good, but maybe the execution was off. Not communicating clearly or being considerate of the parents' expectations could be where they went wrong. So, maybe the author is at least partially at fault. The answer might be A.\n"
