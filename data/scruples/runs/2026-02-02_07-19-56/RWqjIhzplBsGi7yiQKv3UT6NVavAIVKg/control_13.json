The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The parents came over at 2:30 PM, and the author told them they'd come down by 3 PM. The parents were upset about not being greeted immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is very pregnant with baby #3, and they have twins who are almost 2. The twins didn't nap, so everyone was in bed. The author texted parents to let themselves in and eat. The parents arrived and waited until 3 PM. The author's reasoning was to give the wife and kids more rest, which makes sense because a pregnant woman with young kids might be exhausted. The parents were upset, but the author tried to explain the situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The parents might feel disrespected because they were waiting for half an hour without being acknowledged. However, the author's intention was to let the family rest, which is a valid concern. The parents might have expected to be greeted upon arrival, but the author had a valid reason for not waking them up immediately. \n\nI should also consider communication. The author did inform the parents they could let themselves in and make themselves comfortable. Maybe the parents expected more active engagement, but the author's message was clear. The wife felt guilty, but the author's decision was to prioritize family rest. \n\nIn many situations, people might understand that when a family is in a rough patch with young kids, rest is crucial. However, the parents might not have that perspective. It's a matter of differing expectations. The author tried to explain but the parents were upset. \n\nMaybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps the author could have let the parents know they were resting and would come down as soon as possible. But the parents were already informed and even texted when they arrived. The author gave a specific time (3 PM) so the parents might have been expecting an exact time. If the parents felt disrespected, maybe it's their own reaction, but the author's intention was good.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions were to protect the family's rest, which is understandable. The parents' reaction might be harsh. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
