The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author (AITA) didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. His wife is heavily pregnant, and they have twins. The twins wouldn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed sleeping. He texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, planning to come down in an hour. His parents arrived at 2:30, and he told them they'd be down by 3. But the parents were upset they weren't greeted immediately and left mad. His wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respecting the parents' time and the family's need for rest. The parents probably expected to be greeted upon arrival, which is a common social norm. By not waking the family up, the author might have disregarded his parents' feelings of being uninvited or ignored. However, the author's reasoning was to give his wife and kids much-needed rest, especially with the third child coming. His wife's health and well-being are important, especially during pregnancy.\n\nBut the parents felt disrespected. Is the author wrong? It's a balance between family needs and guest expectations. The parents might not have considered the family's situation, but the author could have handled it better. Maybe he should have informed them earlier or set clearer expectations. However, the parents arriving at 2:30 and being asked to wait until 3 isn't that long, but maybe they felt disrespected regardless.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural norms and expectations. In some families, immediate greeting is expected. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because he didn't acknowledge their arrival, even if he had a good reason. However, the parents' reaction could also be overly sensitive. The wife's upset feelings add another layer. The author's intention was to help his family rest, but the method might have been flawed. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe partially. He didn't consider the parents' feelings as much as he should have. The answer could be A (yes) because he didn't communicate properly or make his parents feel respected. But if you prioritize the family's health, maybe B (no). But in social terms, guests expect some level of attention. I'm leaning towards A.\n"
