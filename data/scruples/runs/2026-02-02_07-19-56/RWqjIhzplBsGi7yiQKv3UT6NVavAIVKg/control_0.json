My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever.

My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. \n\nFirst, the situation: the wife is very pregnant with their third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The parents were coming over in the afternoon, so the husband texted them to let themselves in and told them to come at 2:30, but he said they'd come down at 3. The idea was to give the wife three hours of sleep and the twins an hour and a half. The parents were upset they weren't greeted and left, and the wife felt bad.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respecting family time and communication. The husband's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife and kids, especially since the wife isn't sleeping much. The parents felt disrespected, as they expected to be greeted when they arrived. \n\nNow, considering family dynamics. Parents might have certain expectations when visiting, like being greeted and spending time together. The husband's decision, while well-intentioned, didn't consider the parents' feelings about being kept waiting. Even if the parents often watch TV alone, the husband didn't communicate clearly. Telling them they could let themselves in and eat whatever is one thing, but not informing them that the family would be asleep and not available for a while might lead to misunderstandings. \n\nAlso, the wife felt responsible, which adds to the emotional impact. The husband could have perhaps warned the parents in advance that they might be a bit delayed, or maybe even set clearer expectations. Maybe a better approach would have been to inform the parents that everyone was asleep and they'd be down soon, so the parents weren't left in the dark. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband was trying to help his wife and kids get much-needed rest, which is a valid concern. However, not considering the parents' perspective and the importance of their visit might have led to the conflict. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The husband had good intentions but maybe didn't communicate effectively. The parents felt disrespected, which is a significant factor. In such cases, communication is key. If he had explained the situation before they arrived or during the wait, maybe the parents wouldn't have been as upset. Therefore, the husband might share some responsibility for not managing expectations properly. \n\nBut also, the parents might have been more understanding if the husband had explained the situation. Still, the fact that they were upset and left suggests that the husband's actions were perceived as rude. So, perhaps the answer is that he is in the wrong (A), because while his intentions were good, the lack of communication and consideration for the parents' feelings led to the problem. Alternatively, if the parents were being unreasonable, maybe not. But given the information, the husband's approach might have been too abrupt.\n"
