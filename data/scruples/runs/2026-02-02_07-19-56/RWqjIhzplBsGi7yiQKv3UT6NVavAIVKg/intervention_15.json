The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents came over. The situation involves a pregnant wife, twins who didn't nap, and parents arriving at 2:30 after being told to let themselves in. The author planned to come down at 3 to give everyone more rest. The parents were upset and left, and the wife felt guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents were explicitly told to let themselves in and the author communicated that they'd be down at 3. The author's intention was to prioritize rest for his family, especially his pregnant wife. However, the parents felt it was rude not to greet them immediately upon arrival.\n\nPossible angles: Did the author communicate clearly? He did text them to let themselves in and said they'd be down at 3. But maybe the parents expected a greeting when they arrived. The author didn't wake the family up, which might have been a mistake because not acknowledging their arrival (even if just briefly) could be seen as neglectful.\n\nAnother point: The parents might have felt ignored or not respected. Even if the family was asleep, maybe a minimal greeting would have been appreciated. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014prioritizing family rest\u2014but the execution might have been lacking. Not considering the parents' feelings of being snubbed could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the wife's upset reaction adds another layer. She blamed herself for being asleep, which might indicate that she felt the situation was her fault, but the author could have handled the communication better. Maybe he should have checked in with his parents upon their arrival via a call or message to let them know they were there and that the family was sleeping, so the parents felt acknowledged.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, in some families, not greeting guests immediately might be seen as impolite. The author's parents might have expected a more active welcome, even if the family was tired. The author's decision to let everyone sleep could be seen as reasonable, but the lack of communication during their arrival might have caused unnecessary hurt.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between his valid need to rest a tired family and the parents' expectations. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's room for improvement in handling the communication. However, the parents' reaction might also be overly harsh. If the author had communicated that the family was asleep and they'd come down shortly, maybe the parents wouldn't have been so upset. Since he didn't check in when they arrived, it might come off as neglectful. So, maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because he didn't consider the parents' feelings enough, even if his intention was good.\n"
