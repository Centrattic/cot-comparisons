The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author didn't wake up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The parents were upset because they felt ignored.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The wife is very pregnant with the third child, and they have twins who are almost two. The twins didn't nap, so everyone ended up in the bed watching a movie and fell asleep. The author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat, saying they'd come down at 3 when the parents arrived at 2:30. The parents were upset they weren't greeted immediately.\n\nI should consider the parents' perspective. They were told to let themselves in, but when the author's family didn't come down right away, the parents might have felt disrespected. However, the author's reasoning was to maximize rest for his wife and kids, especially since the wife isn't sleeping much. \n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? Maybe the parents expected a certain level of attention when visiting, like a greeting. But the author was trying to accommodate his family's needs. The wife blamed herself, which adds emotional weight. \n\nThe key points are: the author prioritized his family's rest, which is understandable given the circumstances. However, not informing the parents of the plan or checking in might have been a miscommunication. The parents might have felt neglected because they weren't aware of the reason for the delay. \n\nBut the author did text them when they arrived and said they'd meet them at 3. So maybe the problem was the time difference. An hour is a long time for someone to wait. Maybe the parents were expecting to be greeted immediately. The author might have underestimated the parents' need for immediate interaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's family was in a vulnerable state, and he's trying to manage their needs. The parents might have been too harsh in their reaction. The author's actions were well-intentioned, but perhaps he should have considered the parents' feelings more. Maybe a middle ground, like informing the parents that they'll be down soon but not exactly the reasoning, might have helped. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, the parents might have felt disrespected. The answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because the intention was to take care of his family, but there's a possibility of misunderstanding. However, considering the parents' reaction, maybe the author should have communicated better. But given the context, it's B.\n"
