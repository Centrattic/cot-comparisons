The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The parents came over expecting to be greeted, but the author thought it was better to let everyone nap. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: the wife is pregnant and not sleeping much, the twins were already asleep, and they wanted to maximize rest. They texted their parents to come in and make themselves comfortable, expecting to come down later. The parents were upset they weren't greeted immediately. \n\nNow, considering the parents' perspective: when someone comes over, especially for a visit, it's customary to greet them when they arrive. Even if it's a family visit, expecting them to just come in and entertain themselves without any greeting might be seen as neglectful. The parents might feel slighted or not valued. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to take care of their family's well-being, especially with the wife's health and the kids' sleep. The twins were already asleep, and waking them up again might not be ideal. The author tried to communicate the plan in advance by texting the parents. \n\nBut maybe the mistake was not checking in with the parents after they arrived. Even if the author thought an hour was enough, a quick check-in to let the parents know they were there and ask how they were doing could have eased the tension. The parents might have felt ignored or disrespected by being left alone for an hour without any communication.\n\nAlso, the wife's upset reaction suggests that she felt bad about being asleep and not welcoming the parents. Maybe the author didn't consider how the parents would react to the lack of immediate interaction. While the author had good intentions, the execution might have been lacking in communication and consideration of the parents' feelings.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's intention was to care for their family's needs, but the result was that the parents felt disrespected. The key issue is whether the author's decision to let everyone sleep without considering the parents' expectations was wrong. Since the parents were guests, it's important to honor their presence and show respect, even if it means sacrificing a bit of sleep. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't adequately communicate or consider the guests' experience.\n"
