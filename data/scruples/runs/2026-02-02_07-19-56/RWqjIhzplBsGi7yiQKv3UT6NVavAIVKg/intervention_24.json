The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author didn't wake up their wife and kids when their parents arrived. The wife is heavily pregnant, and they have twins who refused to nap. They all ended up sleeping in bed. The parents texted when they arrived, and the author told them they'd come down in 30 minutes. The parents got upset when they weren't greeted and left. The wife felt bad for being asleep.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They came over expecting to be greeted, maybe to have some social time. Waiting an hour without being informed might feel like being ignored or disrespected. On the other hand, the author was trying to let their family rest, especially the pregnant wife. The twins not napping would make things even harder, so getting as much rest as possible is important.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it better. Instead of just letting them in, maybe they could have sent a quick update that they were still resting but would be down soon. Or perhaps check in again closer to the 30-minute mark. The parents might have felt disrespected because they weren't even acknowledged when they arrived. Also, the wife feeling guilty suggests that maybe the author should have woken her up just to greet the parents briefly, even if she was sleeping.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents overreacted. The author was trying to prioritize family needs. But in social situations, it's often expected to greet guests upon arrival. Not doing so could be seen as rude. The author might have assumed the parents would understand, but communication could have been better. So, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances and how the parents reacted. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because not informing the parents they arrived and expecting them to just wait without any communication might be considered rude. Even if the reason was valid, the parents might need some acknowledgment. However, some might argue that the author was trying to help their family rest, so it's a bit of a gray area. But given that the parents were upset and left, the author's approach might not have been considerate enough.\n"
