The twins refused to go down for a nap so we ended up all in our bed, watching a movie, and all three of them fell asleep on me. My parents were coming over for the afternoon, so I texted them to just let themselves in and make themselves at home and eat whatever. They texted me when they arrived, at 2:30, and I told them we'd be down at 3, because I figured that would give my wife three hours of sleep and my twins about 1.5 hours. My wife isn't sleeping much these days so I wanted to maximize how much rest she got since she was finally sleeping. I figured my parents could just watch tv for half an hour, which they often do at our house anyway. However, when we came down, they were very stuffy and upset that we didn't let them in and greet them and told us we were very rude. I tried to explain I was just giving everyone time to nap, but they were pretty mad that I didn't wake them up when they got there, and they ended up leaving. My wife was very upset, since she blamed herself for being asleep. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not waking up his wife and kids when his parents arrived. The situation involves the wife being pregnant, twins who are napping, and the parents coming over.\n\nFirst, the author texted his parents to let themselves in and eat. They arrived at 2:30, and he told them to wait until 3. The parents felt it was rude not to greet them upon arrival. The wife ended up upset, blaming herself for being asleep. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, possible angles: respecting guests, communication issues, family dynamics. The parents might have expected a greeting, which is a social norm. The author might have assumed the parents would wait, but not considering their feelings. The wife's health and rest are important, but maybe the author didn't handle communication well. Did he inform the parents clearly about the nap time? Did he consider their perspective? Maybe the parents felt disrespected or unimportant. The author might have been trying to help but mishandled the situation. The answer might be A (author in the wrong) because of the lack of communication or not considering the parents' feelings despite good intentions.\n"
