I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a shop owner selling Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner is throwing them away each time. Then, one day, the owner decides to cook less veggies to avoid waste. The customer gets angry, and after a scene, the owner gives him more veggies again.\n\nThe main question is whether the owner is in the wrong for not giving the vegetables. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered. The standard dish includes vegetables, right? So when the owner altered the dish without consulting the customer, that's a change. The customer expected the same dish every time. By reducing veggies without asking, the owner modified the order, which the customer didn't ask for. Even if the reason is to prevent waste, the customer's right to receive what they ordered is important.\n\nBut on the other hand, the owner is facing food waste. If the customer doesn't eat the veggies, maybe there's a way to address that without altering the dish. Maybe suggesting a different option or asking if they want fewer veggies next time. However, the owner didn't communicate that. They just changed the dish, which led to the customer's anger. \n\nThe customer isn't being rude or nice; they just leave the veggies. So the owner's action of changing the dish without consent might be the issue. The customer's expectation was to get the same dish each time. The owner's responsibility is to provide the ordered meal as agreed. Even if the customer doesn't eat it, the owner can't unilaterally change the order without discussing. \n\nSo, the owner's mistake was not communicating the change. The correct approach would be to ask the customer if they want fewer veggies next time. Since they didn't do that, altering the dish without consent leads to the customer feeling their order was wronged. Hence, the owner is in the wrong for not giving the vegetables without prior communication.\n"
