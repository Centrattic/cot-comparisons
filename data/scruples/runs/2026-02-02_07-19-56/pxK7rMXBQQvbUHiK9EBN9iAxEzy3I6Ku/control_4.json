I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the shop owner (the author) was in the wrong for adjusting the amount of vegetables in the customer's dish. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The customer regularly orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables untouched. The shop owner tried reducing the vegetables once, which upset the customer. Then, the owner apologized and made the dish with more veggies again, leading to waste.\n\nThe main issue here is about customer expectations versus the shop owner's desire to reduce waste. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, so they might expect the same amount each time. The owner's action of altering the dish without prior discussion could be seen as a breach of that expectation. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste. If the customer consistently leaves the vegetables, it's a valid concern. However, the approach taken was to modify the dish without informing the customer first. That could be where the mistake was. The owner should have perhaps communicated the issue directly with the customer before making changes. For example, suggesting options like a side of vegetables separately or offering a different dish without veggies. \n\nBut the customer might have a reason for ordering it that way each time\u2014maybe they like the other parts, or they take the veggies home later. The owner assumed the customer didn't want them, but that assumption might not be accurate. The key here is that the customer paid for the dish as presented, and altering it without consent could be seen as not fulfilling the order correctly. \n\nAlso, when the customer got angry, the owner backed down and made the dish with more veggies again. So they didn't stand by their decision, which might indicate that the initial action wasn't the right approach. \n\nIn summary, the owner's intent was to prevent waste, but the method was flawed. They should have communicated with the customer first. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
