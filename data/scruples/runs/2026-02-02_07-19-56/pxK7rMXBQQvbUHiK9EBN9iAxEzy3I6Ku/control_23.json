I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which made the customer angry. The owner then reverted to the usual amount, resulting in waste again.\n\nThe question is whether the owner is in the wrong for not giving the veggies. To decide, I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the customer's side: They ordered a dish as usual, expecting it to be prepared the standard way. When the veggies were reduced without prior notice, they got upset. Customers usually expect consistency in their orders. The owner changed the dish without consulting the customer, which could be seen as altering the product without permission, hence possibly the owner's fault.\n\nBut then there's the waste issue. The owner is concerned about food waste, which is valid. However, the customer might have preferences that aren't communicated. The owner's solution was to adjust the dish, but that might not be the right approach. Maybe the owner should have asked the customer if they wanted fewer veggies instead of assuming. \n\nThe key here is whether the owner has the right to modify a dish without the customer's consent. Since the customer pays for the dish as ordered, the owner is bound to provide it as per the original recipe unless specified otherwise. Altering it without discussion could breach that understanding. \n\nAdditionally, the owner could have addressed the waste by asking the customer if they wanted modifications in the future. That way, both parties can find a middle ground. The owner's action of changing the dish without communication likely caused the conflict. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the owner is in the wrong) because they modified the order without the customer's input, which is the customer's right to expect a consistent product. The owner should have handled it differently by communicating first.\n"
