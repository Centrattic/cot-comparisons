I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner starts giving the customer less vegetables to avoid waste, which makes the customer angry. The owner then gives more vegetables again, leading to waste.\n\nThe question is whether the shop owner is in the wrong. The user thinks the owner is wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The dish includes vegetables, which are part of the standard portion. By altering the dish without prior discussion, the owner changed the item the customer paid for. The customer might expect consistency in their order. The owner's action could be seen as not fulfilling the order as agreed, hence a breach of the service contract.\n\nHowever, the owner's intention was to reduce waste. That's a valid concern, but the method might be problematic. The correct approach would be to discuss with the customer about their dietary preferences beforehand. Since the owner didn't ask and made changes unilaterally, that could lead to dissatisfaction.\n\nAlso, the customer didn't indicate a problem with vegetables before. They might have an allergy, dislike them for taste, or have other preferences. The owner's assumption that the customer never eats vegetables might not account for all possibilities. Changing the dish without consent could be seen as disrespectful to the customer's order.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is trying to manage resources efficiently. But the responsibility to communicate and adjust the order should be on the customer. The owner's role is to provide the ordered dish as per the customer's specifications. If the customer wants a modification, they should request it. Since the owner didn't offer that option, they might be at fault for not adhering to the order.\n\nSo, considering all points, the owner altered the dish without the customer's consent, leading to a conflict. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong for not respecting the customer's order as placed. The answer would be A.\n"
