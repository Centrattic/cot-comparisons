I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The shop owner is asking if they're at fault for reducing the vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer usually leaves them uneaten. The customer got angry when the vegetables were reduced.\n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered. The owner has been throwing away veggies each time, which is a waste. The owner tried adjusting the recipe once, but the customer reacted negatively. The owner then reverted to the original dish, leading to more waste.\n\nIs the owner wrong? Well, the customer ordered the standard dish. The owner modified it without prior discussion. Even though the intention was to reduce waste, changing the order without consulting the customer might be an issue. However, the customer has consistently wasted veggies, which could be a valid reason for the owner to want to adjust the portion. But the owner's approach might have been abrupt. Maybe the right move would be to talk to the customer first about options like a different dish or adjusting the order. Instead, the owner assumed and altered the dish, leading to conflict. So, the owner might be in the wrong for not communicating better. But also, the customer could be considered wasteful. The key point is that modifying a customer's order without discussing it first is generally not the customer's fault, but the owner's responsibility. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they changed the order without prior agreement.\n"
