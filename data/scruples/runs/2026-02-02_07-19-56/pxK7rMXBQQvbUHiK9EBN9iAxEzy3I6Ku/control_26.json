I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables untouched, leading to waste. The owner decided to cook fewer veggies for him once, which made the customer upset. They had a scene, then the owner made it right by adding more veggies, ending up with waste again.\n\nSo the question is whether the shop owner is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the customer ordered the dish as usual. The owner changed the order without prior notice, which could be seen as altering the product without consulting the customer. Even if the customer never eats the veggies, the owner didn't ask for preferences beforehand. The customer might have expected the dish to be as ordered, so reducing ingredients without permission could be a breach of expectations. \n\nHowever, the owner's concern about waste is valid. If the customer is consistently leaving food, maybe there's a way to address it politely, like offering to adjust the portion if they prefer. But in this case, the owner didn't communicate. The customer's reaction was anger, which the owner didn't anticipate. \n\nThe shop owner did apologize and cooked the dish correctly again, so there's an effort to make amends. The main issue is that the owner made a unilateral decision without discussing with the customer. Customers expect consistency in their orders, so changing the dish without permission could be seen as wrong. \n\nBut on the other hand, the owner has a right to manage waste. Maybe the correct approach would be to ask the customer if they prefer less veggies next time. Since the owner didn't do that, they might be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe not. Business owners have some discretion in how they prepare food, especially if it's a regular customer. However, the customer paid for the dish as it was originally ordered. The owner's action could be seen as not fulfilling the customer's order, hence the customer's right to be upset. \n\nSo the answer might be A (yes, the owner is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and altered the order without consent. But if the owner had asked first, that would be different. Since they didn't, the customer's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the shop owner is at fault.\n"
