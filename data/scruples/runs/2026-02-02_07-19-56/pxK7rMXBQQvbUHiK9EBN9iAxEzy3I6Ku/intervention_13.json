I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner (the author) is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who leaves them uneaten. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish repeatedly and leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner then decides to cook less vegetables, which upsets the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of both parties. The customer ordered the dish as usual, so they might expect it to be prepared in the standard way. The shop owner modified the dish without informing the customer, which could be seen as changing the order without prior agreement. That might be the issue here. The owner's intention was to reduce waste, which is understandable, but not communicating the change could lead to confusion or dissatisfaction.\n\nThe customer's reaction was anger, which is a strong response, but they might have a valid point if they expected the same dish each time. However, the owner did explain the reasoning after the fact, which the customer didn't like. The owner then had to make a new dish, resulting in the same waste. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is it acceptable for the owner to modify the dish to prevent waste? Some might argue that the customer has the right to get exactly what they ordered, even if part goes uneaten. Others might say that the owner has a responsibility to reduce waste and could have addressed the issue differently, like asking the customer if they want fewer vegetables.\n\nThe key points are: the owner changed the dish without prior consent, which could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectations. The customer paid for the dish as ordered, so expecting consistency is reasonable. The owner's action was well-intentioned but perhaps handled in a way that didn't respect the customer's autonomy. Maybe the owner should have discussed the change first. \n\nSo, whether the owner is in the wrong depends on whether changing the dish required consent. If the customer had the right to expect the same meal, then the owner might be in the wrong for altering it without asking. However, if the owner can adjust meals to prevent waste, then maybe not. But usually, customers expect their orders to be consistent unless they specifically request changes. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes) because the owner didn't communicate the change first, leading to the customer's upset.\n"
