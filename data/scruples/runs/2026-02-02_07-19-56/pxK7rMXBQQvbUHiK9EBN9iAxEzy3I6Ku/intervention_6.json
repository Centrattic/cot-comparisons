I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a local shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables. The shop owner tried reducing the veggies to avoid waste, but the customer got upset. Now the owner is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are about customer expectations vs. food waste. The customer is paying for the full dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. By altering the order without prior discussion, the owner might have violated the customer's expectations. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, they might still expect the dish as presented. \n\nThe owner's intent was to reduce waste, which is understandable, but the approach might have been abrupt. Instead of changing the order without asking, maybe a better approach would be to communicate with the customer first. For example, suggesting a modified version of the dish with fewer veggies and seeing if they agree. That way, the customer's choice is respected, and waste is avoided.\n\nAlso, the customer might have preferences or reasons for ordering the dish with veggies, even if they don't eat them. Maybe it's part of the dish they enjoy looking at, or maybe they sometimes do eat them. The owner can't assume that. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, businesses usually need to honor the customer's order as per what's available unless there's a prior agreement. Changing the order without consent can lead to dissatisfaction, even if the intention is good. \n\nSo, while the owner has valid concerns about waste, the method of addressing it by altering the dish without discussing with the customer could be seen as the owner's fault. They should have communicated first. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
