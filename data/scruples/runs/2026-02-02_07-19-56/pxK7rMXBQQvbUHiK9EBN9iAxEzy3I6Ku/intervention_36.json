I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. So, the shop owner is asking if they're at fault for reducing the vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer usually leaves them uneaten. The customer gets angry when the vegetables are reduced and then the owner ends up throwing them away again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. They ordered the same dish every time, which presumably includes vegetables. The owner assumes the customer doesn't like vegetables because they're left uneaten each time. But maybe there's another reason. For example, the customer might not like the type of vegetables used, or maybe they have a dietary restriction, or perhaps they're trying to eat more of the other components and just don't want to waste the dish. The owner didn't ask the customer directly why they don't eat the vegetables. That's a possible oversight. \n\nThen there's the issue of customer expectations. If someone orders a dish, they expect to receive the standard version of that dish. The owner altered the dish without prior notice or communication. Even if the owner thought it was to prevent waste, changing the order without consulting the customer could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectations. The customer might have ordered the dish with vegetables for a reason, like to have a balanced meal or to have the option, even if they don't eat them every time. \n\nAnother angle is the business aspect. The owner is trying to reduce food waste, which is a commendable goal. However, the approach here was to unilaterally change the order without discussing it with the customer. Maybe a better approach would be to ask the customer if they'd like the dish without vegetables or to suggest a modification. That way, the customer can make an informed choice. \n\nAlso, the customer's reaction might have been due to surprise or feeling disrespected. The owner's comment about not cooking vegetables because the customer doesn't eat them could be perceived as dismissive or accusatory. This might have contributed to the customer's anger. \n\nIn terms of rights and responsibilities: The customer paid for the dish as ordered, so the owner is expected to fulfill the order as per the customer's request. Altering it without consent can be problematic. However, the owner has a responsibility to manage resources efficiently, including minimizing waste. \n\nThe key here is communication. The owner didn't communicate the change in advance or explain the reasoning to the customer before serving the modified dish. If the owner had discussed it, maybe the customer would have appreciated the effort to reduce waste or agreed to a different solution, like a price adjustment for less food. \n\nIn conclusion, the owner's action of reducing vegetables without prior communication might be seen as inconsiderate to the customer's expectations and the implicit agreement of the purchase. The author is in the wrong because they made a decision that altered the customer's order without discussing it, leading to the conflict. However, the underlying issue of food waste is valid, and there might be a better way to handle it moving forward.\n"
