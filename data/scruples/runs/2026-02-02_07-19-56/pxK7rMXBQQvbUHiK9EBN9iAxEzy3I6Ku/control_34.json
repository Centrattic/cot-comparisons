I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried to adjust by giving fewer veggies, which made the customer upset. Now the owner is wondering if they were in the wrong for not giving the usual amount of vegetables.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The owner's job is to prepare the dish according to the order. If the customer didn't specify any modifications, like less vegetables, then the owner is providing what was agreed upon. By reducing the vegetables without prior consent, the owner changed the order. That could be seen as not honoring the customer's request, even if the customer doesn't eat them. The customer might have ordered the dish with the expectation of getting the same portion each time, including the vegetables.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste. That's a valid point. However, the way the owner handled it might have been abrupt. Instead of just cutting the veggies without discussing, maybe the owner could have asked the customer if they wanted a modification. Since the customer didn't mention it before, maybe they weren't aware they could ask for changes. The owner's approach led to a confrontation, which could have been avoided with communication.\n\nThe customer's reaction suggests that they value having the vegetables, even if they don't eat them. Maybe it's part of the dish's presentation or they're sharing it with someone else. The owner's action of reducing the veggies might have seemed like a betrayal of the usual order. Even though the owner later made it right by giving more veggies, the initial act was without consent. \n\nBusinesses typically have to follow the customer's order unless there's a prior agreement to modify. The owner has the right to manage waste, but altering an order without permission might breach the customer's expectations. The customer is paying for the full dish, so the owner might be in the wrong for modifying it without discussion. However, the owner's intention was to prevent waste, which is a good point, but the method was flawed. So, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because they altered the order without the customer's consent, even with good intentions.\n"
