I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. The situation is that the customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the vegetables once, which made the customer angry. Then they reverted to the original order, causing more waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the business side. The owner has a right to manage resources efficiently. Food waste is a big issue, and if the customer is consistently leaving part of the meal, it's a valid concern. The owner's intention to reduce waste by adjusting the portion is understandable.\n\nBut then, the customer expected the same dish as before. When the vegetables were reduced, the customer got upset. This suggests that the customer's expectations were not communicated clearly. The owner didn't check with the customer before changing the dish. Maybe the customer values the vegetables for another reason, or maybe they just like the dish but can't eat the veggies for personal reasons (like allergies, taste, or dietary restrictions). \n\nOn the other hand, the customer is paying for the full dish each time, including the veggies they don't eat. The owner is absorbing the cost of the unused veggies. Is it fair for the owner to adjust the dish without prior discussion? Maybe the owner should have asked the customer if they could modify the dish to avoid waste. Instead, the owner made a unilateral decision, which led to conflict.\n\nAlso, the customer's right to get what they ordered is a standard practice. If the dish is modified without prior agreement, it could be seen as the owner's fault. The fact that the customer made a scene might indicate that the change was unexpected and unexplained. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the customer could have communicated their preference for less veggies from the start. But the owner has a duty to provide the ordered dish unless there's a prior arrangement. The owner's action, while well-intentioned, might have violated the customer's expectations without proper communication. \n\nSo, the owner might be in the wrong because they changed the order without consulting the customer. The waste issue is valid, but the solution should involve open communication. The correct approach would be to discuss with the customer to find a mutually agreeable solution, like a vegetarian-free option or a different portion size. By not doing that, the owner acted unilaterally, leading to the conflict.\n"
