I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is facing a situation where a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables uneaten. The owner noticed this waste and tried to adjust by reducing the amount of vegetables in the dish. However, the customer got angry when the vegetables were less than usual. The owner then reverted to the original recipe, leading to continued waste.\n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. Even if he doesn't eat them, he's paying for the full dish. The owner's decision to alter the dish without prior communication could be seen as a change in the product, which customers generally expect to be consistent. The customer's anger might stem from the unexpected change, especially since he's been ordering the same thing regularly. The owner might not have considered that the customer might have a reason for not eating the vegetables but still expected them to be there, perhaps for presentation or other dietary reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste, which is a valid issue. If the customer is consistently leaving food, it's a waste of resources. However, the owner's approach to solving the problem\u2014changing the dish without consulting the customer\u2014might have been the root of the conflict. The proper approach could have been to ask the customer if he wanted modifications to the dish, rather than making assumptions.\n\nThe key here is the expectation of consistency in a restaurant. Customers order what they know, and changing the recipe without prior notice can lead to dissatisfaction. The owner could have addressed the issue by communicating with the customer first, offering an alternative, or perhaps discussing possible solutions to reduce waste while still fulfilling the customer's order. By not doing so, the owner altered the product without consent, which could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectations, even if the intent was good.\n"
