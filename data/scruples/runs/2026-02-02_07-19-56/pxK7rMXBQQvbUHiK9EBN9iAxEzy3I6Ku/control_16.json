I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving the customer vegetables in their dish. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The customer regularly orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables uneaten, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the vegetables once, and the customer got angry. The owner then reverted to the original amount, resulting in more waste.\n\nThe main question is if the owner did something wrong by adjusting the vegetable quantity. Let's consider the customer's perspective. They ordered the dish as it's normally prepared, and when the owner changed it without prior notice or consultation, it upset them. Even though the customer doesn't eat the vegetables, they might expect the dish to be made as per their regular order unless they specifically request a modification. The owner's action could be seen as altering the standard dish without the customer's consent, which is why the customer reacted negatively.\n\nFrom the owner's viewpoint, there's a valid concern about food waste. Preparing a dish with fewer vegetables could save resources and reduce waste. However, the standard practice in customer service is usually to provide the ordered item as prepared unless there's a customization requested. The owner might not be obligated to accommodate unspoken preferences, especially if it's the first time making such a change.\n\nAlso, the customer isn't asking for a modification; they're just not eating the vegetables. The owner didn't check in with them before altering the dish. Maybe the customer has a reason for not eating the vegetables (like a diet, allergy, or personal taste) that they haven't communicated. The owner's approach, while well-intentioned, might have been abrupt. A better approach could be to ask if they want fewer vegetables next time instead of assuming.\n\nThe fact that the owner had to make a new dish after the customer's complaint means that the initial adjustment didn't work out. But the key point is whether the owner had the right to change the order without the customer's input. In most cases, businesses serve what's ordered unless there's a specific request. So, the owner might be in the wrong here because they modified the dish without consulting the customer, leading to dissatisfaction. However, there's a counterpoint about food waste, but the solution might require a different approach. \n\nConsidering the balance between business ethics and customer expectations, the answer likely leans towards the owner being in the wrong for not giving the customer the standard dish they ordered without prior discussion.\n"
