I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is at fault for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish regularly but leaves the vegetables each time. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which upset the customer, and then made it again with more veggies, ending up with waste.\n\nHmm, first, the customer pays for the dish as ordered. The owner is altering the order without prior notice. Normally, if a customer wants a modification, they should ask. But the owner noticed the waste and tried to adjust. However, changing the order without consulting the customer could be seen as a problem. The customer might expect the dish as per their usual order. The owner's action might be seen as not respecting the customer's order, even if the customer isn't eating the veggies. But also, food waste is a valid concern. Maybe the owner should have discussed it with the customer first. So, the owner's action was well-intentioned to reduce waste but perhaps overstepped by not communicating. So, maybe the owner is in the wrong. But some might argue that the customer isn't being responsible. Hmm. I think the answer is A, the owner is in the wrong because they modified the order without the customer's consent. Even if it's for a good reason, the customer paid for the dish as described. The solution should have been to ask the customer if they wanted modifications instead of assuming. So the answer is A.\n"
