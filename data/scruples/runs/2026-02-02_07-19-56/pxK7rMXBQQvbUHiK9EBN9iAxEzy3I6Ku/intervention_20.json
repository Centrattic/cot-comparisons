I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The shop owner is asking if they're at fault for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the veggies, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which upset the customer. Now they're back to the original dish, still wasting food.\n\nHmm. The key points here are customer expectations and food waste. The customer paid for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. By altering the order without prior agreement, the owner changed the product. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, they might expect the dish they paid for. The owner did mention the reason, but maybe they should have discussed it first. However, the customer's consistent waste is also a factor. But the main issue is the owner's unilateral decision to modify the order. So, maybe the owner is in the wrong because you can't change a customer's order without their consent. The customer has the right to what they ordered. So answer A.\n"
