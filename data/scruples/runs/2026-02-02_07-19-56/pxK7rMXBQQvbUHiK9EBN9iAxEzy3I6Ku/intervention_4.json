I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for reducing the vegetables in the customer's dish. The customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried to adjust, but the customer got angry. The owner then gave in and added more vegetables.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. They ordered the dish as usual, so they probably expected the standard portion. Changing the recipe without prior notice might be seen as a breach of what the customer expected for their money. The customer might feel that the dish is incomplete without the vegetables, even if they don't eat them. Maybe the vegetables are part of the experience or a personal preference. The owner's decision to alter the dish could be seen as disrespectful, even if it's to reduce waste.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop owner has a valid concern about food waste. If the customer isn't eating the vegetables, it's a waste of resources. The owner tried to find a solution by adjusting the portion, which is a reasonable attempt to minimize waste. However, the owner didn't communicate this change to the customer, which led to confusion and anger. Communication is key here. If the owner had discussed the issue with the customer and found a mutual agreement, maybe the situation could have been handled better.\n\nAlso, the customer paid for the full dish, so they might feel they're entitled to all parts of it. Even if they don't consume it, the payment remains the same. The owner might be overstepping by altering the dish without consent. However, the customer isn't making a complaint about the vegetables except when they were reduced. There's no prior history of the customer requesting modifications, so the owner's action might be unexpected.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of customer service. Customers expect consistency. Changing the dish without notice could lead to dissatisfaction. The owner's initial approach to reduce vegetables might be seen as a good intention, but it's important to maintain the customer's trust by honoring their order unless there's an agreement to modify.\n\nIn terms of food waste, maybe there's a different solution. The owner could ask the customer if they want the vegetables included each time, or perhaps offer to remove them after cooking. However, the customer might not appreciate being asked every time. The owner could also consider portion sizes that are still edible for the customer but less wasteful, like smaller quantities or different cooking methods where the vegetables can be stored or used elsewhere.\n\nThe key points here are communication, customer expectations, and mutual respect. The owner's action was to prevent waste, which is commendable, but the method might not be appropriate without the customer's consent. The customer's reaction indicates that they value the presence of vegetables in the dish, even if they don't eat them. Therefore, the owner altering the dish without prior discussion might be the wrong approach. The correct step would be to have a conversation with the customer to find a solution that satisfies both parties, such as a modified dish or a different arrangement to reduce waste without compromising the customer's order.\n"
