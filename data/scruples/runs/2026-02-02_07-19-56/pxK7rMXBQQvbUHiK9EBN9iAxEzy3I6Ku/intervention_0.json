I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables, leading to food waste. The owner tried reducing the vegetables once, which upset the customer, and then had to give them again.\n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. The owner argues that since the customer doesn't eat them, it's wasteful. But the customer might have a reason for not eating veggies\u2014maybe dietary restrictions, taste, or texture. The owner changed the dish without consulting the customer, which could be seen as altering the order without permission. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, the order was placed with them included. The owner's action of modifying the dish led to the customer's anger. While the owner's concern about waste is valid, the approach might have been wrong. Customers expect to receive what they ordered. If the owner wanted to address waste, maybe they should have asked the customer if they wanted fewer veggies instead of just changing it. So, the owner might be in the wrong for not respecting the customer's order without prior discussion.\n"
