I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables untouched, leading to waste. The shop owner decided to reduce the vegetables in the dish, which made the customer angry. Now the owner is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, so they might expect the full portion, including vegetables. Changing the dish without prior notice could be seen as altering the order, which the customer might not appreciate. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, it's their choice. The owner's action might come across as assuming the customer's preference without being asked.\n\nFrom the owner's side, the issue is food waste. Vegetables are being thrown away every time. The owner tried to address the problem by adjusting the dish, but without communicating with the customer first. This lack of communication led to the customer feeling that their order was changed without consent, hence the anger.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Is the owner allowed to modify the dish? If the customer has always ordered it a certain way, they might have an expectation of consistency. The owner could be seen as not fulfilling the contract (the order) as agreed. However, the owner might argue that reducing ingredients to prevent waste is reasonable, but this is more of a business ethics question.\n\nAlternatives the owner could have taken: Maybe asking the customer if they wanted fewer vegetables, or offering a different version of the dish. But the owner didn't do that, so changing the dish unilaterally could be problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility for waste, the owner might feel it's the customer's fault for ordering something they don't eat. However, the owner is the business owner and has a duty to manage their resources efficiently. Maybe they could have suggested a different dish or discussed options with the customer to avoid waste.\n\nSo, is the owner in the wrong? They did act without the customer's consent, which could be seen as a breach of the service agreement. The customer is entitled to the dish as ordered unless there's prior discussion. The owner's intention was good (reducing waste), but the method was flawed. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they altered the customer's order without asking, leading to the customer's dissatisfaction. However, some might argue that the owner is trying to be responsible with resources, so maybe not in the wrong. But typically, changing an order without the customer's consent is considered a service issue, so A seems more likely.\n"
