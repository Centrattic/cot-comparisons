I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish each time and leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, but the customer got angry. Now they're back to throwing away the veggies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, so they expect the full meal. The shop owner is concerned about food waste. The owner tried to adjust the portion to reduce waste, but that led to a conflict. \n\nIn terms of rights and responsibilities, the customer has the right to the meal they ordered unless there's a prior agreement. The shop owner has a responsibility to provide the ordered item. Changing the order without the customer's consent might be seen as a breach of that agreement. However, the owner's intent was to reduce waste, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut is the owner in the wrong? If the customer didn't mention not wanting vegetables, the owner's decision to alter the dish could be problematic. The owner should have communicated first. Maybe a better approach would be to ask the customer if they want the veggies reduced in the future. Without that, changing the order could be considered the owner's fault. Also, the customer paid for the vegetables, so even if they don't eat them, they're part of the dish. The owner's action might be seen as not fulfilling the order as requested. So, the answer might be A (Yes), the owner is in the wrong for altering the order without the customer's consent.\n"
