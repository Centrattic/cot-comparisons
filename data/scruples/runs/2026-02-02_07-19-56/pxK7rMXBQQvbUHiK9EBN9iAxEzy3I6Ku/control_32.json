I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is at fault for reducing the vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer leaves them uneaten. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish regularly and always leaves the vegetables. The shop owner tried to adjust by putting fewer vegetables, which upset the customer. The owner argues that it's a waste, but the customer expects the standard dish. \n\nThe key points here are customer expectations and the terms of the service agreement. When someone orders a dish, they expect it to be prepared as it's usually made. Changing the recipe without prior notice or consultation could be seen as altering the order without the customer's consent. Even if the customer isn't eating the vegetables, it's their choice to order the dish as it's presented. The owner might have a valid point about waste, but the method of adjusting the dish without asking could be the issue. The customer might not have ordered the vegetables directly, but they're part of the dish. So the owner's action might infringe on the customer's right to receive the product as ordered. But there's also the aspect of food waste. However, the main conflict here is the owner changing the order without discussion. The customer might feel their order was altered without permission, leading to the argument. So, considering standard service practices, the owner is probably in the wrong for modifying the dish without consulting the customer first. Therefore, the answer would be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
