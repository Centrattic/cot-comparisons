I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer regularly orders the same dish, leaves the veggies uneaten, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which made the customer angry. Then they gave more again, resulting in waste.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, but not consuming the veggies. The owner's action was to modify the dish to reduce waste. Now, the question is about right and wrong here.\n\nFrom a business perspective, a customer pays for a specific product. If the dish includes vegetables as part of the standard recipe, changing it without prior notice might be seen as altering the product without consent. Even if the customer doesn't eat them, they might expect the dish as ordered. However, the owner's concern is about food waste, which is valid.\n\nBut, the owner did make a change without the customer's agreement. The customer might have ordered the dish expecting the usual amount of veggies. The owner's decision to adjust it could be seen as not fulfilling the order as agreed, leading to the customer's frustration. The owner then had to backtrack and provide the usual dish, which still led to waste but resolved the immediate conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between respecting customer expectations and minimizing waste. The owner's intention is good, but the method might have been flawed. Perhaps a better approach would be to communicate with the customer, offering options like a side of veggies or a modified dish, thus respecting their preference without altering the order unilaterally.\n\nSo, considering all this, the owner might be in the wrong because they changed the dish without the customer's consent, even if the motive was to reduce waste. The customer's right to receive the ordered product as per their usual request is important. The owner should have discussed the issue with the customer first to find a mutual solution instead of making unilateral changes.\n"
