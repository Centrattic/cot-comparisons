I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer has been ordering the same dish every time, leaving the vegetables untouched, leading to waste. The owner tried adjusting the portion of vegetables once, which caused the customer to get angry. The owner then apologized and reverted to the original amount, resulting in more waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard business practices. Customers typically order what they want, and altering the order without prior communication could be seen as a problem. The owner did modify the dish without confirming the customer's preferences, which might be a breach of expectations. Even though the customer didn't mention the vegetables before, the owner assumed they didn't like them based on past behavior. But in business, it's generally the customer's choice, and the owner has an obligation to provide what was ordered unless modifications are discussed.\n\nHowever, the owner's intent was to reduce waste, which is a valid concern. But the method\u2014changing the order without asking\u2014could be problematic. The customer might have had a reason for ordering the vegetables, like a diet change or a specific need, which the owner isn't privy to. By altering the dish, the owner made an assumption that might not be correct.\n\nOn the other hand, repeatedly throwing away food is wasteful. The owner could have approached the customer to ask if they could adjust the portion, but didn't. The customer might have expected the same dish each time, so changing it without notice could be considered a mistake. The owner's initial action was inconsiderate, but the customer's reaction was over-the-top as well.\n\nSo, balancing these points, the owner probably did make a mistake by not discussing the change first. The right approach would have been to communicate and offer a modified version. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
