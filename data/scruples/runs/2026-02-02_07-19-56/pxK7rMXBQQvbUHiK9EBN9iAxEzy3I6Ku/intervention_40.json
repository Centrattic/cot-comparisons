I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The shop owner is getting frustrated because a regular customer always leaves the vegetables in his dish uneaten, causing food waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which made the customer angry. Now they're back to normal, but still wasting food.\n\nSo the question is whether the owner is in the wrong for not giving the veggies. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered. He might not like the veggies, but he's not allergic or anything. If he ordered it, maybe he just prefers the non-veg part. The owner's job is to fulfill the order. Altering the dish without prior notice could be a problem. The customer expected the usual, so changing it without consent led to the scene. \n\nOn the other hand, food waste is a concern. Maybe the owner could have asked the customer if they wanted veggies or offered a different option. But since they didn't, and just changed it without discussing, that's probably why the customer got upset. \n\nSo the owner's approach was a bit abrupt. The right move might have been to communicate first, like asking if they wanted the veggies or adjusting the dish. So the author is in the wrong because they changed the order without talking to the customer first, leading to a conflict. Therefore, answer A.\n"
