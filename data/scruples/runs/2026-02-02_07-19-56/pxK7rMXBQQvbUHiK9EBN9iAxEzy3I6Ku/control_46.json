I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner, frustrated by the waste, decides to cook less vegetables next time. The customer gets angry and makes a scene, so the owner gives in and makes the usual portion again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. He ordered the dish as it's normally prepared, so he might expect consistency. The owner changed the dish without prior communication, which could be seen as altering the order without the customer's consent. That might be a problem because customers generally expect to receive what they ordered. The owner's reasoning is about reducing waste, which is understandable, but the way it was handled could be the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is trying to prevent food waste, which is a valid concern. Maybe there's a middle ground, like asking the customer if they want a modified version next time. But the owner didn't do that and changed the dish on their own. That could lead to the customer feeling their order was not respected. \n\nThe customer's reaction might be because they want the dish as it is, even if they don't eat the veggies. Maybe they have dietary preferences or the veggies are part of the experience they expect. It's possible the customer isn't aware of the waste each time, so maybe a friendly conversation about it could help. \n\nThe key points are: the owner altered the order without discussing it, leading to customer dissatisfaction. The owner's action was to prevent waste, but the method was abrupt. In customer service, changing an order without consent can be problematic. So, maybe the owner is in the wrong because they didn't communicate the change, even if the intention was good. However, the customer could also be inconsiderate by ordering something they don't eat. But the main issue is the owner's unilateral decision to modify the dish. \n\nI think the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they changed the dish without the customer's agreement, which is a breach of the customer's expectation. The owner should have discussed the change or offered an alternative instead of making the customer confront the issue suddenly. Even though the intention was to reduce waste, the method was flawed.\n"
