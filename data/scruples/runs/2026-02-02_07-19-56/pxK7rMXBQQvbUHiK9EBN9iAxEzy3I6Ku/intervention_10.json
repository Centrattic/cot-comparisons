I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this scenario. The shop owner is dealing with a regular customer who always leaves the vegetables uneaten. The owner tried reducing the amount of vegetables once, which led to the customer getting angry. The main question is whether the owner was wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered, and the owner usually includes vegetables. The customer's choice not to eat them might be a personal preference, maybe dietary restrictions, taste, or even cultural reasons. But the owner is concerned about food waste. \n\nThe owner changed the dish without prior communication. Even though the intention was to reduce waste, changing the order without asking the customer could be seen as a breach of their usual agreement. Customers expect consistency when they order their usual. The owner might have assumed the customer didn't care about the veggies, but that's an assumption. \n\nWhen the owner adjusted the recipe, the customer reacted negatively. The owner then reverted to the original dish. The key issue here is the lack of communication. If the owner wanted to address the waste, maybe a better approach would be to ask the customer if they wanted a modification next time. \n\nAlso, the owner's responsibility is to provide the ordered dish as per the customer's request. Altering it without permission might be seen as not fulfilling the order correctly. The customer has the right to get what they paid for, even if they don't eat part of it. \n\nHowever, there's a valid concern about food waste. But the solution should involve the customer's consent. Maybe offering a side of veggies instead of including them in the main dish, or suggesting alternatives. The owner's action was a bit abrupt and didn't consider the customer's perspective fully. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the owner made a change without discussing it with the customer. So, the answer might lean towards the owner being in the wrong (A) because they altered the order without asking. But if the owner had communicated the change first, maybe the outcome would be different. But based on the scenario, the answer is A.\n"
