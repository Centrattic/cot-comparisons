I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time and leaves the vegetables untouched, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which caused an argument, and then had to make the regular portion again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. They might have a right to expect the full meal. However, the owner is concerned about food waste. There's a balance between customer expectations and sustainability.\n\nThe shop owner's action was to adjust the portion without prior consultation. Maybe the customer had a reason for ordering vegetables they didn't eat, like dietary changes, personal taste, or even aesthetics. The owner's approach might have been abrupt. Instead of just reducing veggies, maybe they should have discussed it first. However, the customer's consistent waste also isn't ideal.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the owner could have communicated better. Approaching the customer politely to ask about their preference might have been a better step. Forcing a change without that could be seen as dismissive of the customer's order. On the other hand, the customer's repeated waste is also an issue.\n\nSo, is the owner at fault? They did make a unilateral decision, which led to conflict. The customer's right to receive what they ordered is important, but the owner's concern about waste is valid. The key might be whether the owner should have communicated before altering the order. Since they didn't, maybe they are partly at fault. However, the customer's role in the waste is also a factor. The answer might hinge on communication and expectations. The owner could have handled it differently, but the situation is a bit of a grey area.\n"
