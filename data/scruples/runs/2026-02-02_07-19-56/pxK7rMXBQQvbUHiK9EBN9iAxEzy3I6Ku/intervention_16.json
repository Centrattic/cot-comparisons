I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner starts giving fewer vegetables to reduce waste, but the customer gets angry. The owner then gives more vegetables again, leading to waste.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving vegetables. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation from both sides. The customer orders a specific dish, which presumably includes vegetables as part of the standard preparation. The owner has a right to prepare the dish as ordered, but the customer consistently leaves the vegetables. The owner is trying to cut down on waste by adjusting the portion size, which leads to conflict.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they ordered the dish as usual and expected it to be prepared the same way each time. Changing the dish without prior communication could be seen as altering the order, which the customer might not appreciate. The customer might have a reason for not eating the vegetables, but they paid for the dish, so they might expect to receive all components as ordered.\n\nFrom the owner's side, there's a valid concern about food waste. If the customer isn't eating the vegetables, reducing the amount could help minimize waste. However, doing so without informing the customer might be abrupt. The owner should have communicated the change first, maybe asking if the customer wanted the usual amount or a modified version. Instead, the owner made the change without discussing it, leading to the customer's anger.\n\nThe key points here are communication and adherence to the customer's order. The owner's intention to reduce waste is commendable, but the approach was flawed. The customer has a right to expect consistency in their order. The owner could have addressed the issue by discussing it with the customer first, perhaps offering an alternative that doesn't involve reducing vegetables. For example, maybe the customer could have been asked if they wanted the vegetables omitted entirely or if they needed a different preparation.\n\nIn terms of legal or contractual obligations, the customer paid for the dish as presented. The owner has a responsibility to provide what was ordered. Changing the dish without consent could be seen as not fulfilling the order properly. However, there's also an ethical consideration about food waste. The owner could be trying to do the right thing environmentally, but the method was poor.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they altered the customer's order without prior communication, leading to a conflict. The right approach would have been to talk to the customer about the waste issue and find a mutual solution, like adjusting the order with the customer's agreement. By not doing so, the owner disrupted the customer's expectations and caused a scene.\n"
