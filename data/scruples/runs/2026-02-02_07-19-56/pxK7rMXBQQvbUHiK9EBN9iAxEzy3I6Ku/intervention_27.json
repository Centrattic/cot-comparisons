I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for reducing the vegetables in the customer's dish because the customer doesn't eat them. The customer ordered the same dish as usual but ended up not eating the veggies each time, leading to waste. The owner decided to adjust the portion once, which upset the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard customer service practices. Typically, customers expect to receive the dish as ordered. Changing it without prior notice might be seen as a breach of what was agreed upon. Even if the owner had a good reason, like reducing waste, the customer might feel their order was altered without consent. \n\nThen there's the issue of food waste. While the owner is trying to be responsible, the customer may not be aware that their habit is causing waste. Maybe the owner could have approached it differently, like asking the customer if they wanted a modified version next time instead of making the change themselves. \n\nAlso, the customer might have specific dietary needs or preferences that aren't obvious. Even if they don't eat the veggies, there could be a reason, like a medical issue, that the owner isn't considering. Assuming the customer is at fault for ordering something they don't eat might be an oversimplification. \n\nThe owner did offer to cook the dish with more veggies after the customer got angry, which shows they tried to resolve the situation. However, the initial action of altering the order without consulting the customer could be problematic. In many businesses, changing an order without the customer's agreement is generally not acceptable unless there's a clear understanding beforehand.\n\nSo, while the shop owner's intention was to reduce waste, the method of doing so without the customer's consent might be the issue. The correct approach would have been to communicate with the customer first. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong here.\n"
