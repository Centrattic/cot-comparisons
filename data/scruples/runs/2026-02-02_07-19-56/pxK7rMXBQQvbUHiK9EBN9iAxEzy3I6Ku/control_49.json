I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for adjusting the amount of vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer doesn't eat them. \n\nFirst, the customer has been coming in regularly, ordering the same dish, and leaving the vegetables each time. The owner is concerned about food waste, so they decide to reduce the veggies. The customer gets upset when the veggies are less. The owner then complies by adding more veggies again, leading to waste.\n\nHmm. The key points here are customer expectations vs. the owner's effort to reduce waste. The customer paid for the dish as ordered, which presumably includes the vegetables. By changing the dish without consulting the customer, the owner might have violated the customer's expectations. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, they might have ordered the dish in its standard form. The owner's decision to alter the dish without discussing it first could be seen as unprofessional. \n\nAlso, the customer might value consistency in their order. The owner's action, while aimed at reducing waste, wasn't communicated, leading to confusion and anger. The owner could have approached the customer to ask if they wanted fewer veggies next time instead of assuming. \n\nBut another angle: the owner is trying to prevent waste. Maybe the customer isn't aware that they can request modifications. However, the owner's role is to provide the dish as ordered unless a modification is requested. Changing it without notice might not be the best approach. \n\nSo, the owner might be in the wrong for altering the order without the customer's consent. The correct approach would be to communicate and offer options instead of making unilateral decisions. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
