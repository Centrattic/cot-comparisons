I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is at fault for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish regularly but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which made the customer angry, then reverted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop owner's perspective. They're trying to minimize food waste, which is a valid concern. However, when they altered the dish without the customer's consent, it led to a conflict. The customer paid for the dish as ordered each time, so their expectation was to receive the standard meal. Changing the portion without asking might breach the implicit contract of the order.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer could have communicated their preference earlier. But the owner has the right to manage resources efficiently. Still, modifying the order without prior notice or giving the option to adjust (like offering to remove veggies for a fee) might be the owner's misstep. The key here is whether the owner had the right to alter the order without informing the customer. Since the customer was paying for the standard dish, the owner's unilateral change might not be justified, making them partly at fault.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the owner is in the wrong) because they changed the order without consulting the customer, even if the intention was to reduce waste. The proper approach would have been to discuss with the customer first or offer a modified option with an explanation.\n"
