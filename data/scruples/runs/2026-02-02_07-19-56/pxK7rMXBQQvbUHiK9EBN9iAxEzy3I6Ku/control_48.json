I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for adjusting the amount of vegetables in the dish because the customer leaves them uneaten. \n\nFirst, the customer always orders the same dish and leaves the vegetables. The owner tried reducing the veggies to prevent waste but the customer got angry. The owner then gave him more veggies again, leading to waste.\n\nSo, the main points are food waste versus customer expectations. The customer pays for the dish as usual, but the owner is trying to reduce waste. The question is whether the owner overstepped by changing the dish without consulting the customer.\n\nIn terms of customer service, usually, you should provide what the customer orders unless there's a special request. The owner assumed the customer doesn't like veggies, but maybe the customer wanted the veggies for another reason, like taking them home later. The owner didn't ask, just changed the dish, which could be seen as not respecting the customer's order. \n\nHowever, the owner has a valid point about food waste. It's a balance between the customer's right to their order and the owner's responsibility to minimize waste. But in most service scenarios, the customer's order is what they pay for, even if it leads to waste. The owner could have addressed it by discussing with the customer first, like offering a modified dish with an option to adjust the veggies. \n\nSo, the owner's action might be seen as a good intention but poor execution. Since the customer paid for the dish as ordered, the owner should provide what was ordered unless there's a prior agreement to modify it. Therefore, the answer is A (the owner is in the wrong) because they altered the dish without the customer's consent, even if the motivation was good.\n"
