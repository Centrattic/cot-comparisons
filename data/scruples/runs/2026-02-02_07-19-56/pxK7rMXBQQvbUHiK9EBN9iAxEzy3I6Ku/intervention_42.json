I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The customer orders the same dish every time, leaves the vegetables uneaten, and the owner ends up throwing them away. The owner then decides to cook the dish with fewer vegetables the next time, which upsets the customer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of both parties. The customer pays for the dish as ordered, so they might expect the standard portion. The owner, on the other hand, is concerned about food waste. But is it the owner's responsibility to adjust the portions based on the customer's habits without prior notice or discussion?\n\nThe key here is whether the customer explicitly asked for less vegetables. Since they didn't, the owner made an assumption. Altering the dish without the customer's consent could be seen as a breach of the service agreement. The customer might feel that they paid for the full dish and are entitled to the standard portion. The owner's intention to reduce waste is valid, but the method might be problematic. A better approach might have been to ask the customer if they wanted to adjust the portion or offer a different version of the dish. By changing it unilaterally, the owner might have overstepped, leading to the customer's anger.\n\nAlso, the customer isn't being rude or nice, just following their routine. The owner's action, while well-intentioned, disrupted the customer's expectation. So the owner might be in the wrong for not respecting the customer's order as placed, even if the customer's choice leads to waste. The solution would involve communication rather than unilateral changes. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
