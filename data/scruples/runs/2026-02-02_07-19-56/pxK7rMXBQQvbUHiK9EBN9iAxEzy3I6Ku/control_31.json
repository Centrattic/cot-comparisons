I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the shop owner is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The customer orders the same dish every time, leaves the veggies, and the owner ends up throwing them away. So the owner decided to cook less veggies one time, and the customer got upset. Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about customer expectations versus food waste. The customer probably expects the dish as ordered, which includes the standard amount of vegetables. The shop owner, on the other hand, is trying to reduce waste because they know the customer doesn't eat the veggies. But the customer got angry when the veggies were reduced. \n\nI think the owner has a valid point about waste. It's not like the customer is complaining about the veggies, just not eating them. But the problem is, when you order a dish, you expect it to be prepared as per the standard. Unless the customer specified they don't want vegetables, the owner might be altering the dish without permission. That could be seen as not honoring the order. \n\nThe owner tried to be proactive to prevent waste, but maybe they should have discussed it with the customer first instead of changing the dish on their own. The customer made a scene, which suggests they felt the dish was not as ordered. So the owner might be at fault for changing the dish without asking. \n\nBut then again, is it the owner's responsibility to accommodate a customer's eating habits even if it's not requested? Maybe not. The customer didn't mention they don't like veggies, so the owner's assumption could be risky. The key here is whether the customer had communicated their preference. Since they didn't, the owner might be in the wrong for altering the dish without consent. \n\nSo, in terms of customer service, you usually prepare the order as given unless specified otherwise. The owner's action, while well-intentioned to reduce waste, might have violated the customer's expectation. Therefore, the answer might be A (the owner is in the wrong). But I'm a bit confused because the owner is trying to do the right thing by avoiding waste. Maybe there's a middle ground, like offering a modified dish and charging less, but that wasn't done here. So sticking to the facts: the customer didn't specify, the owner changed the dish without permission. So the owner is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
