I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The owner sells Asian food, and a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner tried reducing the vegetables once, leading to an argument. The customer got angry, and the owner ended up making the dish with more veggies again, resulting in waste.\n\nSo the key points here are: the customer pays for the dish as ordered, but doesn't eat the veggies. The owner is concerned about food waste and tried adjusting the portion, which caused a conflict.\n\nNow, the question is if the owner is in the wrong. The customer's right to get what they ordered vs. the owner's right to manage resources and reduce waste. \n\nIn many places, businesses have some discretion in how they prepare food, especially if they're running a tight operation. However, the customer is paying for a specific dish. If the dish includes vegetables as part of the standard recipe, modifying it without prior communication might be an issue. The owner did try adjusting it once, but didn't inform the customer beforehand, leading to the scene. \n\nThe owner's intention was to reduce waste, which is understandable. But altering the dish without the customer's consent could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectation. The customer might have ordered the dish with the understanding that it includes a certain amount of vegetables. Even if they don't eat them, the payment covers the full dish as presented. \n\nHowever, maybe the owner could have discussed the issue with the customer first. Instead of just changing the recipe, perhaps offering a different option or asking if they wanted fewer veggies next time. That way, there's mutual understanding. \n\nIn terms of responsibility for waste, the business isn't necessarily obligated to adjust every dish for individual preferences unless specified. But there's also a case for the customer not ordering something they don't want. Yet, it's possible the customer might not have known they could request modifications. \n\nSo, while the owner's action was well-intentioned to reduce waste, the method might have been abrupt. The customer's reaction suggests they expected the standard dish. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong for not communicating and adjusting without prior discussion. But there's also a gray area here. Maybe the answer is that the owner isn't entirely in the wrong because the customer is contributing to waste by not eating the veggies, but the approach taken could have been better. However, legally or ethically, modifying the dish without consent might still be an issue. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the intent was to reduce waste, and the customer's behavior is contributing to the problem. However, the execution could have been smoother. But since the question is about being in the wrong, perhaps the answer is B. But some might argue A if the customer's right to the ordered dish is paramount. Hmmm. Need to weigh these factors.\n"
