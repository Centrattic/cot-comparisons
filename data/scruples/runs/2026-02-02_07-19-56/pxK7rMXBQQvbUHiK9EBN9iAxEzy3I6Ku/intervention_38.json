I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer always orders the same dish, leaves the veggies untouched, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, the customer got angry, and then the owner went back to the original amount.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about customer expectations versus the owner's responsibility to minimize waste. The customer pays for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. The owner modified the order without prior communication, which led to a conflict. \n\nFirst, I need to consider standard business practices. Customers typically expect to receive the dish as ordered. If there's a modification, the business should inform them in advance. The owner made a change without discussing it with the customer, which might be seen as not respecting the customer's order. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, the order includes them, so altering the dish without consent could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the owner's concern about food waste is valid. There's a balance between accommodating a regular customer's preferences and maintaining the integrity of the dish. Maybe the owner could have suggested alternative solutions, like offering a dish without veggies or asking the customer if they want to modify the order each time. But since the owner didn't communicate the reason or offer alternatives, it led to the customer's frustration.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standpoint, businesses are generally expected to fulfill orders as placed. Changing the order without the customer's agreement could be seen as not honoring the contract. However, the customer isn't allergic or having a medical issue; they just don't like the veggies. So, the owner's modification was based on their own judgment, not the customer's specific needs.\n\nThe key here is the lack of communication. If the owner had asked the customer in advance if they wanted fewer veggies or offered a different option, it might have been handled better. But changing the dish unilaterally and then reverting when the customer complained might be seen as the owner's fault for not handling the situation diplomatically.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the owner might be in the wrong because they altered the order without consulting the customer. The waste is a problem, but the solution involved not respecting the customer's original order. The correct approach would have been to discuss the issue first.\n"
