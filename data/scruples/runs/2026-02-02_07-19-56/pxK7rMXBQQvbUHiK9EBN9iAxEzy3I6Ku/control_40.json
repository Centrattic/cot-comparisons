I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for reducing the amount of vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer leaves them uneaten.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The customer orders the same dish every time and leaves the vegetables. The owner is concerned about food waste, so they decide to cook less veggies for that customer. The customer gets upset and makes a scene. The owner then complies by making more veggies again. The question is whether the owner was wrong for adjusting the dish.\n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the standard practice is to provide what the customer orders unless there's a specific request. The owner changed the dish without consulting the customer, which might be seen as altering the order without permission. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, the owner could have asked if they wanted fewer vegetables next time instead of assuming. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is trying to reduce food waste, which is a valid concern. However, the method of addressing it without communication might be problematic. The owner's action was proactive but could be seen as overstepping because the customer paid for the dish as it's normally prepared. \n\nLegally, the customer pays for the full dish, so modifying it without consent could be an issue. Ethically, while food waste is a concern, the owner should balance that with honoring the customer's choice. The owner could have addressed the waste by offering a different dish option or discussing portion sizes. \n\nThe customer's reaction, while possibly unreasonable, doesn't justify the owner changing the dish without consent. The owner's approach might have been abrupt, leading to the conflict. A better approach would have been to talk to the customer first about adjusting the dish to their preference to avoid waste. \n\nIn summary, the owner's action was well-intentioned but perhaps not the right approach without prior communication. Changing the dish without the customer's input could be seen as a breach of service expectations, even if the intent was good. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong for not giving the vegetables without discussing it first.\n"
