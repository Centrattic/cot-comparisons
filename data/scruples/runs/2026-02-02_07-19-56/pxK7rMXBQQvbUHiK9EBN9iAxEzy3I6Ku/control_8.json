I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for adjusting the vegetable amount because a customer leaves them uneaten. \n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish every time and leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The shop owner tried reducing the veggies once, which caused the customer to get angry. The owner then reverted to the original recipe, resulting in more waste.\n\nFrom the shop owner's perspective, they\u2019re trying to reduce waste. The customer is paying for the full dish, which includes vegetables they don't eat. The owner's action was to modify the dish to prevent waste, but the customer expected the standard dish. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The customer is getting what they ordered, but the owner altered it.\n2. The owner's justification is to minimize waste.\n3. The customer reacted negatively when the dish was changed.\n\nIn many places, businesses can have some flexibility in preparing dishes unless specific requests are made. However, if the customer has never mentioned the vegetable quantity before, the owner might have assumed it was part of the standard order. Changing the dish without prior communication could be seen as altering the order without consent. \n\nBut considering food waste is a valid concern. The owner could have asked the customer if they could adjust the vegetables in the future, instead of making a unilateral decision. The situation escalated because the owner didn't communicate their intention beforehand. \n\nSo, while the owner's intent was good (reducing waste), the method might have been flawed. The customer had a right to expect the dish as they had ordered it before. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong for changing the dish without discussing it with the customer first.\n"
