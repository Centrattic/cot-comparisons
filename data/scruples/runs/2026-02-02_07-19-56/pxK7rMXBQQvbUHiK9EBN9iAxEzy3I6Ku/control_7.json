I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The shop owner is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the veggies, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the vegetables once, and the customer got angry. Then they made it again with more veggies, leading to waste again.\n\nSo the main issue here is about food waste versus customer expectations. The owner feels it's wasteful to keep adding veggies that aren't eaten. The customer, on the other hand, expects to get the dish as ordered each time. \n\nFirst, when the owner modified the dish without consulting the customer, that might have been the problem. The customer didn't ask for less veggies, so changing the order without discussing could be seen as overstepping. Even if the intention was good, altering the dish without permission might violate the customer's expectations. \n\nHowever, the waste is a valid concern. Maybe the owner could have approached the customer differently, like asking if they wanted the veggies reduced next time or offering a different option. But in this case, the owner acted on their own, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, the owner's action of changing the dish without the customer's input is where the mistake lies. The customer has the right to receive what they ordered unless there's prior agreement to modify it. The owner's intention was to prevent waste, but the method was inappropriate. Therefore, the owner is in the wrong (A).\n"
