I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is facing a situation where a regular customer consistently leaves the vegetables in his dish uneaten, leading to food waste. The owner tried reducing the amount of vegetables once, which caused the customer to get upset. The main question is whether the owner was in the wrong for not giving the usual amount of vegetables.\n\nFirst, the customer always orders the same dish and pays normally. He doesn't mention any dietary restrictions or preferences beforehand. The issue arises because the owner, concerned about waste, altered the dish without prior communication. The customer's reaction suggests that the vegetables are an important part of his meal, even if he doesn't eat them. Maybe he likes the appearance, or they're part of the flavor balance, or he has a personal reason for ordering them that isn't obvious.\n\nFrom a business perspective, customers typically expect their orders to be prepared as standard unless specified otherwise. The owner had the customer's consent to prepare the dish a certain way each time. Changing the recipe without prior discussion could be seen as altering the agreed-upon order, which might be why the customer was upset. The owner's intention was good\u2014to reduce waste\u2014but the method might have been flawed. \n\nHowever, the customer's habit of not eating the vegetables is also a factor. If the customer had communicated his preference for less or no vegetables earlier, the owner could have adjusted accordingly without conflict. But since he didn't, the owner has a right to prepare the dish as ordered. \n\nThe key here is the expectation management. The customer's order is a contract; by not informing the customer beforehand that the dish might be modified, the owner breached that unspoken contract. Even if the owner's intention was to prevent waste, the standard practice in customer service is to maintain the order unless the customer specifies changes. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author (the shop owner) did act in the wrong by not communicating the change and altering the dish without the customer's consent. The proper approach would have been to discuss it with the customer first to find a solution that respects both parties' needs.\n"
