I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The shop owner is asking if they're at fault for reducing the amount of vegetables in a regular customer's dish because the customer never eats them. The customer then got upset and made a scene. The owner threw away the vegetables again after cooking more for the customer.\n\nSo, first, the customer orders the same dish every time. The owner notices the customer leaves the vegetables, so they decide to cook less of them. The customer gets angry, and the owner ends up cooking the original amount again. The owner is frustrated because it's wasteful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the owner is in the wrong. Let's break it down. When someone orders a dish, they expect to receive it as ordered. If the dish typically includes vegetables, changing that without prior notice might be an issue. The owner didn't consult the customer before altering the dish, which could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectations. Customers have the right to get what they order unless there's a prior arrangement. \n\nThe owner's intention was to reduce waste, which is understandable. However, the approach was to unilaterally change the dish's composition. The customer might have had a reason for ordering the dish with more vegetables, even if they don't eat them. For example, maybe they order the dish for someone else, or they wanted to have the vegetables for later, or perhaps they just prefer the consistency of the dish as it is. \n\nBy not discussing the change first, the owner might have overstepped. While food waste is a valid concern, the solution here was to address it without altering the customer's order without consent. The owner could have approached the customer, explained the waste issue, and asked if they wanted to adjust the order. That way, the customer could decide. \n\nThe owner tried that explanation after reducing the vegetables, but it was after the fact. The customer was already upset. The owner then had to cook more vegetables, leading back to waste. \n\nSo, the key point is whether the owner had the right to modify the order without the customer's agreement. Since the customer pays for the dish as ordered, the owner's actions could be seen as altering the order without permission, which is a problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the customer's order, even with good intentions.\n"
