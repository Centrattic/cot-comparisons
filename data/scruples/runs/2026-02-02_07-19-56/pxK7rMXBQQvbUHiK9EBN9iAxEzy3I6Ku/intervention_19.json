I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables uneaten. The owner ends up throwing them away each time. Then, in one instance, the owner decides to cook a version with fewer vegetables to reduce waste. The customer gets angry, the owner explains the reasoning, the customer makes a scene, and the owner ends up cooking the usual dish again.\n\nThe question is whether the author (shop owner) is in the wrong for not giving the vegetables. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, from a business perspective: The customer pays for the dish as ordered. Altering the dish without prior discussion could be seen as changing the product. The owner might argue that it's about preventing waste, but the customer expects consistency. By changing the dish, even slightly, the owner might have breached the customer's expectations. However, the owner could also say that since the customer never consumes the vegetables, maybe there's a way to adjust it, but communication is key here.\n\nEthically, food waste is a concern. If the customer is leaving food uneaten, it's wasteful. But the owner's role is to fulfill the order as requested. The customer might not like the vegetables but chose to order the dish regardless. Maybe the vegetables are a standard part of the dish, and the customer isn't specifying any modifications. The owner's action was a kind gesture to prevent waste, but the customer wasn't happy. \n\nBut the owner did discuss it with the customer, right? They said, \"you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it?\" But the customer might still expect the full dish. The problem is that the owner modified the dish without the customer's permission. Even if it's for a good reason, changing the order without consent can be seen as overstepping. \n\nThe customer's reaction is understandable because they paid for the dish and it's different now. The owner's intention was to reduce waste, but they didn't ask the customer first. So, maybe the owner should have communicated differently, like offering a modified version but letting the customer decide. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author (shop owner) likely is in the wrong because they altered the dish without the customer's consent, even if it's with good intentions. The customer has the right to expect the dish they ordered. However, the owner's concern about waste is valid. A better approach might have been to ask the customer if they wanted less vegetables to avoid waste in the future, rather than making the change unilaterally. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the dish was changed without the customer's agreement, even if it was a well-meaning action to prevent waste.\n"
