I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables uneaten. The shop owner then decided to give the customer less vegetables to avoid waste. The customer got angry and made a scene. The owner then gave more vegetables again, resulting in waste.\n\nThe question is whether the owner is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the customer paid for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. The owner modified the dish without prior notice, which could be seen as not honoring the order. Even if the customer doesn't eat the vegetables, the order was for the full dish. The owner has a responsibility to provide what was ordered unless there's an accommodation requested. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner might be concerned about food waste. But the standard practice is to provide the ordered item as is unless the customer specifies a modification. The owner could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer vegetables next time instead of assuming. Changing the dish without consultation could be considered inconsiderate or a breach of the agreement made when the order was placed. \n\nThe customer's reaction was anger because they expected the standard dish. The owner's action might be seen as overstepping since modifications typically require prior agreement. Even though the intention was to reduce waste, the method was flawed. \n\nSo, the owner is in the wrong because they altered the order without the customer's consent. The correct approach would be to discuss modifications with the customer instead of making unilateral changes. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
