I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which made the customer angry. Then had to redo it with more veggies.\n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered. The owner changed the order without consulting the customer. Even if there's waste, the customer has the right to get what they ordered unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. The owner's action of altering the dish could be seen as not fulfilling the order as requested. The customer might feel disrespected or that their preferences aren't considered. \n\nBut the owner's intention was to reduce waste. However, business ethics usually require that a customer gets what they paid for. The owner should have communicated the issue first, maybe asked if the customer wanted modifications. Without that, changing the order unilaterally could be a breach of the service agreement. So the owner is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
