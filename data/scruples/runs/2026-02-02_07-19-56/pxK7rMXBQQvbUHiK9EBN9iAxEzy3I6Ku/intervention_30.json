I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner sells Asian food, and a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner starts modifying the dish to have fewer veggies to reduce waste, but the customer gets upset. The owner then complies and gives more veggies, resulting in waste again. The question is whether the owner is in the wrong for reducing the veggies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider standard practices in customer service. Typically, customers expect to receive what they order. If the dish includes vegetables, altering it without prior notice might be an issue. The owner didn't ask the customer first, which could be a problem. The customer might have ordered the dish expecting the usual amount of veggies, and changing it without communication could lead to dissatisfaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste. If the customer consistently leaves veggies, it's a valid concern. However, the proper approach would be to discuss this with the customer first. Maybe the customer has a reason for not eating the veggies, like a dietary restriction or preference. The owner could have offered an alternative, like a side option or a different dish. \n\nThe owner's action of reducing veggies without asking led to the customer's anger. Even though the owner had a valid point about waste, the method was abrupt. The customer might feel their order was altered without consent. In business, maintaining customer satisfaction is crucial. Altering a regular order, even with good intentions, can lead to conflict. \n\nThe owner did apologize and made it right by making the dish as usual again, which shows good resolution. But the initial action was a mistake. The key point is that the owner should have communicated first. So, while the waste is a concern, the owner's approach was incorrect. Therefore, the answer would be that the owner is in the wrong (A).\n"
