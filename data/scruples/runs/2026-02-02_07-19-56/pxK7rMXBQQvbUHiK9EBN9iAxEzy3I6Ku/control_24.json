I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish repeatedly but leaves the vegetables uneaten each time. The shop owner, wanting to reduce waste, decides to cook less vegetables for the customer. The customer gets upset, and the owner then complies by adding more vegetables, ending up with waste again.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the customer pays for the dish as ordered, including vegetables. The owner modified the dish without prior communication. Food waste is a concern, but so is customer expectations. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The owner's intention is to reduce waste, which is understandable. However, altering the dish without the customer's consent might be an issue. Customers expect to receive what they ordered unless they specify modifications. By changing the dish, the owner might be violating the customer's expectations. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer is consistently not eating the vegetables, leading to waste each time. But the owner could have approached this differently, maybe by asking if they wanted modifications instead of making assumptions. The owner's action was reactive, trying to solve a waste problem, but perhaps without proper communication.\n\nThe customer's reaction suggests that the vegetables are part of their order, even if they don't eat them. Maybe they have a reason for not eating them, like dietary restrictions or personal preference, but that's not specified. However, the owner's action might be seen as altering the order without permission, which could be a breach of service terms.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, businesses typically provide what's ordered unless changes are discussed. The owner's attempt to prevent waste is commendable, but the method was flawed. The correct approach would be to communicate with the customer about possible modifications to avoid both waste and conflict.\n\nTherefore, the owner is in the wrong for not communicating and modifying the order unilaterally. The answer should be A.\n"
