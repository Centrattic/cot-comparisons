I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables uneaten. The owner, frustrated by the waste, decides to cook less vegetables for the customer. The customer gets angry and makes a scene. The owner then apologizes and serves the usual amount again, leading to more waste.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying full price for the dish as ordered. The owner altered the order without consulting the customer. Even though the intention was to reduce waste, changing the order without the customer's consent could be seen as a breach of service agreement. The customer has the right to receive the dish as they ordered it. The owner's action was a unilateral decision, which might not be acceptable from the customer's perspective.\n\nHowever, the owner has a valid concern about food waste. If the customer consistently leaves the vegetables, maybe there's a way to address that without altering the order. Perhaps the owner could have discussed it with the customer first, offering alternatives like a different dish that suits their preferences or adjusting the portion size with the customer's agreement. By not doing so, the owner acted without the customer's input, leading to dissatisfaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer also has a responsibility to communicate their preferences if they want modifications. If they don't eat the vegetables, maybe they should request a different version of the dish. But the customer might not know they can ask for adjustments. Still, the owner's approach was abrupt and caused conflict. The owner could have handled it more diplomatically.\n\nSo, considering standard customer service practices, the owner should respect the customer's order unless there's a prior agreement to modify it. The owner's action, while well-intentioned, was a mistake in this context. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for changing the dish without the customer's approval.\n"
