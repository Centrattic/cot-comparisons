I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for adjusting the amount of vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer always leaves them uneaten. The customer got angry when the vegetables were reduced, but the owner ended up giving him the usual portion and still had to throw the veggies away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The shop owner is trying to reduce food waste, which is a valid concern. If the customer consistently doesn't eat the vegetables, it's logical to think adjusting the quantity might help. However, the customer expects what he ordered each time. Changing the order without prior discussion might be a problem because customers rely on consistency. \n\nThe owner did mention that the customer pays normally and isn't rude, but the customer's reaction was anger. This suggests that altering the order without communicating could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectations. Even if the owner's intention was good, the customer might feel that their order was changed without consent, which could be a reason for the customer's frustration. \n\nAlso, the owner ended up giving the customer the usual dish again, which implies that the adjustment wasn't acceptable. So, the main issue here is about respecting the customer's order versus trying to prevent waste. \n\nIn business, consistency is key. Customers expect to receive what they've ordered each time. Changing the order without prior agreement or communication might not be the best approach. However, the owner's concern about waste is understandable. Maybe the better approach would have been to discuss with the customer about their preferences and perhaps offer a different dish or a modified version they agree on. \n\nSo, is the owner in the wrong? It depends on the norms of the business. If the customer always orders the same dish and the owner has the discretion to adjust ingredients based on the customer's habits, maybe not. But generally, without discussing, changing the order could be seen as incorrect. The owner's actions led to a conflict, so perhaps the owner is in the wrong for not communicating and adjusting the order unilaterally.\n"
