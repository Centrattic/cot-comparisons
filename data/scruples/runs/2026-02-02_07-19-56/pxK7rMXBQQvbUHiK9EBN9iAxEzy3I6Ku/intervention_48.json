I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. The user is asking for my opinion on whether the author (the shop owner) is at fault for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The customer orders the same dish regularly, leaves the vegetables uneaten, and the owner ends up throwing them away. One time, the owner decided to cook less vegetables because of the waste. The customer got angry, there was a scene, and the owner had to make another dish with more veggies. The owner is now wondering if they were wrong for adjusting the amount of vegetables.\n\nSo, the main points here are food waste and customer expectations. The owner wants to reduce waste, which is a valid concern. But the customer ordered a specific dish, which presumably includes vegetables as part of the standard recipe. By altering the dish without the customer's consent, the owner might have violated the customer's expectations. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, they might expect the dish to come as ordered.\n\nThe owner's argument is that it's a waste, but the customer is paying for the full dish. The customer might not realize they can request modifications, or maybe they want the veggies there for presentation, or perhaps they don't like that type of vegetable but others. The owner made an assumption and changed the dish, which led to conflict.\n\nIn terms of business ethics, usually, customers have the right to request modifications, but the default is to provide what's ordered. The owner could have approached it differently, maybe by suggesting a modification in advance or charging less for a modified dish, but without the customer's input, changing the dish could be seen as not fulfilling the order as agreed. Also, the customer might have felt disrespected or that the owner was making an assumption about their preferences without asking.\n\nAnother angle: The owner could have addressed the waste issue by offering the customer a modified dish at a lower price or asking if they wanted fewer vegetables next time. But instead, they acted unilaterally, leading to the customer's anger. So the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and adjusting without the customer's consent.\n\nHowever, the owner's intention to reduce waste is praiseworthy. But the method might not have been appropriate. So, considering both sides, the answer hinges on whether altering the dish without the customer's knowledge is acceptable. Most businesses require customer consent for modifications. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for changing the order without discussing it with the customer first.\n"
