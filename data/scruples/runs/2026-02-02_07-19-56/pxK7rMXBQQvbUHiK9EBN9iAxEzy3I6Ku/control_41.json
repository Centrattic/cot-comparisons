I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner then tried reducing the veggies to avoid waste, which upset the customer. Now they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered. The owner changed the recipe without consulting them, which might be an issue. Even if the customer doesn't eat the vegetables, the dish is supposed to include them. Altering the order without permission could breach an implicit agreement. However, the owner's intention was to reduce waste, which is understandable. But the customer might expect the dish as presented. Also, the owner reverted to cooking more veggies after the complaint, so the initial act was a trial. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the customer has a right to receive what they ordered. The owner's action might be seen as not honoring the order. But the waste aspect is a valid concern. However, the owner could have addressed the issue differently, like asking the customer if they wanted the veggies or adjusting the recipe in a way that doesn't compromise the dish's integrity. \n\nSo, the key points are: the customer's right to the ordered dish, the owner's responsibility to provide as ordered, and the waste problem. The owner might be in the wrong for changing the order without consultation. Therefore, answer A (yes, in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
