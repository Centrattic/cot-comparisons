I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables. The owner is frustrated because it's a waste. So one time, they decided to put fewer vegetables, and the customer got angry. The owner then gave him the usual amount but still ends up with waste.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the owner is in the wrong. The owner's reasoning is about minimizing food waste. The customer ordered the dish as it's normally prepared. But the owner altered the order without prior notice. Maybe the customer expects the dish as it's presented. \n\nIn terms of customer service, changing the order without asking could be an issue. Even if the motivation is good, not consulting the customer might lead to dissatisfaction. The customer might have their own reasons for not eating the veggies\u2014maybe allergies, dietary restrictions, or just personal taste. The owner didn't ask before modifying the dish.\n\nAlso, the customer paid for the full dish. If the owner prepared it with fewer veggies, maybe the customer felt they didn't get what they paid for. The owner's action could be seen as altering the product without consent. However, the customer is causing waste each time by not finishing the veggies. There's a balance between respecting the customer's order and addressing sustainability concerns.\n\nBut in business, the standard is to provide what the customer ordered unless there's a prior arrangement. The owner could have approached the customer politely to discuss the issue instead of changing the dish. So maybe the owner's action was a bit abrupt. They could have offered a different version of the dish or asked the customer's preference. \n\nThe key points here are customer expectations and communication. The owner made an assumption and acted on it without consulting the customer, which led to conflict. While the intention was to reduce waste, the method might have been inappropriate. So the owner might be in the wrong for not communicating and altering the order without consent.\n"
