I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is facing a situation where a regular customer orders a dish with vegetables but leaves them uneaten every time. The owner tried reducing the vegetables to prevent waste, but the customer got upset. Now, the owner is questioning if they were in the wrong for not giving the usual amount of vegetables.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. From the customer's perspective, they're getting what they paid for, even if they don't eat the veggies. The owner's action of reducing the veggies might be seen as altering the order without prior discussion. The customer might feel they're being judged or that the service is inconsistent, especially since others might get the full dish. \n\nHowever, the owner's concern about food waste is valid. They're trying to be responsible with resources. But the problem is that they didn't communicate with the customer beforehand. Maybe a better approach would have been to ask if the customer wanted fewer veggies or suggest a different dish without veggies. \n\nThe key here is the contractual obligation. When the customer orders a dish, they expect it to be prepared as described. Changing it without consultation could breach that expectation. Even if the customer is causing waste, the owner's responsibility is to fulfill the order as placed unless there's a mutual agreement to modify it. \n\nAlso, the customer's reaction suggests they value consistency in their meal. The owner's unilateral decision to alter the dish might be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of the customer's preferences, especially since the customer isn't asking for a substitute but just not eating the veggies. \n\nSo, while the owner's intent was good, the method was flawed. They should have communicated the option to adjust the order. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong for making the change without discussing it with the customer first.\n"
