I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The shop owner is facing a situation where a regular customer consistently leaves the vegetables in their dish uneaten, leading to waste. The owner tried adjusting the portion size by reducing the vegetables, which upset the customer. Now, the question is whether the author (the shop owner) is in the wrong for not providing the vegetables.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's rights. When a customer orders a dish, they expect to receive what's on the menu. The shop owner might have a standard preparation, so altering it without prior notice could be an issue. The customer might have a reason for not eating the vegetables\u2014maybe dietary preferences, allergies, or personal taste. However, the owner's perspective is about reducing food waste, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut here's the catch: when a business makes a change to an order without consulting the customer, even if the intention is good, it could breach the implicit contract of service. The customer is paying for the dish as it's presented. The owner's initial action\u2014adjusting the portion\u2014might be seen as altering the product without the customer's consent, which could explain the customer's anger. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is trying to prevent waste, which is commendable. However, the approach might not have been the best. Perhaps the owner could have discussed the issue with the customer first, explaining the waste and asking if they'd prefer a different option. Since the customer didn't communicate their preference beforehand, the owner might not be in the wrong for trying to address the waste, but the method could have been better handled.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical responsibility, the business is expected to provide the ordered item as per their menu. If the customer ordered a dish that includes vegetables, the owner might be obligated to include them unless there's a prior agreement to modify the order. The fact that the customer didn't mention their preference about vegetables from the start could mean the owner is within their rights to provide the dish as prepared. So, the owner's action in reducing the vegetables without prior discussion might be seen as a breach, hence being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the dish is customizable and the owner has the discretion, maybe not. But since the customer is a regular, the owner might have expected to know their preferences, but the customer never communicated it. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the owner being in the wrong because they altered the order without the customer's consent, even if the intention was to reduce waste. The customer's right to receive their ordered dish as presented is a key factor here.\n"
