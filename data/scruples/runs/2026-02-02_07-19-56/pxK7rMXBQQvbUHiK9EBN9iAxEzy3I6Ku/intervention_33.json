I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner (the author) is at fault for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The customer orders the same dish regularly but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The shop owner tried adjusting the amount once, and the customer got upset. The owner then reverted to the original dish.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The customer paid for the dish as ordered. Altering the dish without the customer's consent could be an issue. Even if it's to reduce waste, changing the order might breach the implied contract of providing the ordered item. The customer might feel they didn't get what they paid for, hence the author's responsibility to fulfill the order as requested.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between reducing waste and honoring customer expectations. The author's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. Communicating with the customer to offer alternatives (like a different dish without veggies or charging less) could have been better. However, the author didn't do that. Instead, they changed the dish without asking, which led to conflict.\n\nCustomer service perspective: Altering the order without permission can lead to dissatisfaction. The customer expects consistency. The owner's decision to adjust the amount without prior discussion might not consider the customer's preferences accurately. Maybe the customer doesn't like certain veggies, not all. The author's assumption that all veggies are unwanted might be incorrect.\n\nFood waste is a valid concern, but the solution needs to involve the customer. The author could have approached the customer politely, explaining the waste issue and offering to modify the dish with consent. That way, both parties could find a middle ground.\n\nSo, the author acted out of concern but didn't follow proper protocol. Changing the order without asking is a breach of service expectations, making the author at fault. The correct approach would have been to discuss options with the customer rather than unilaterally altering the dish.\n"
