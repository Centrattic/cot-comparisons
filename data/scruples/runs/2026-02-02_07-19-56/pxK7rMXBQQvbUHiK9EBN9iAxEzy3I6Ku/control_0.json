I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The shop owner is asking if they're in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who leaves them uneaten. The customer orders the same dish repeatedly but doesn't eat the veggies, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which upset the customer. Now they're back to the original dish and are frustrated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's rights. When someone orders a dish, they expect it to be prepared as it's usually made. The owner changing the recipe without prior notice could be seen as altering the order, which might not be acceptable. The customer might feel they're being treated differently or that the dish isn't as ordered.\n\nOn the other hand, food waste is a valid concern. The owner is trying to be responsible by minimizing waste. However, the solution might not be to reduce the veggies unilaterally. Maybe the owner should have communicated with the customer earlier, asking if they wanted adjustments to the dish. Since the customer didn't mention their dislike for veggies before, they might not have realized the option was available.\n\nBut once the owner made the change, it's understandable the customer was upset because they were expecting the standard dish. The owner's approach led to a confrontation. The correct step would have been to discuss the change beforehand. So, the owner might be in the wrong for not informing the customer of the intention to modify the dish, rather than the decision itself. The waste is still happening, but the method of handling it could be improved. So the answer might be A, the owner is in the wrong for not communicating properly.\n"
