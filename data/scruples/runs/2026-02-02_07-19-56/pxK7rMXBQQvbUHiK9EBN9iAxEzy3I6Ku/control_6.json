I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for reducing the amount of vegetables in the customer's dish because the customer never eats them. The customer got angry when the vegetables were reduced. \n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish every time, which includes vegetables. Each time, the customer leaves the veggies uneaten, leading to waste. The shop owner tried to adjust the recipe to minimize waste but the customer didn't like it and got upset. The owner then reverted to the original recipe.\n\nSo, the owner's intention was to reduce food waste, which is a valid concern. However, the customer expects the dish as ordered. The owner changed the dish without prior communication, which might be the issue. The customer paid for the dish, and altering it without consent could be seen as not fulfilling the order correctly.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer is the one consistently causing waste by not eating the vegetables. The owner has a right to be concerned about resources. But the key point here is whether the owner has the right to modify the order without the customer's agreement. \n\nIn many service contexts, customers expect to receive what they ordered. Changing the dish, even with good intentions, could be considered a breach of the implicit contract. However, the owner might argue that it's a reasonable adjustment to reduce waste, especially if the customer didn't specify any dietary restrictions previously.\n\nBut the customer didn't ask for the dish to be modified, so the owner's action could be seen as overstepping. The owner should have probably discussed the change with the customer first. Instead, they made the change unilaterally, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, while the owner's concern is valid, the method of addressing it without communication might make them at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A (the owner is in the wrong) because they modified the order without the customer's consent, even if the intention was good.\n"
