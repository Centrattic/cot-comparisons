I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which upset the customer. Now, they're back to normal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, when a customer orders a dish, they expect it to be prepared as per their request. Altering the dish without their consent could be problematic. Even if the customer isn't eating part of the meal, the owner isn't obligated to modify it unless agreed upon. The customer might have a right to the food they paid for, as per their order.\n\nEthically, food waste is a concern. The owner is trying to prevent waste, which is a valid point. However, the method of reducing the vegetables without the customer's knowledge or permission might be seen as inconsiderate. The owner should have communicated beforehand to adjust the dish. The customer might prefer the original recipe and the veggies are part of their meal choice. Maybe they don't want veggies but still want the dish as is, perhaps for taste or other reasons. The owner's initial approach lacked communication, leading to the customer's anger. The owner could have asked if they wanted fewer veggies next time instead of assuming. \n\nSo the owner isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their approach was flawed. The key issue is the lack of communication. The answer might be that they're not in the wrong (B) because the customer's right to their order versus the owner's right to manage waste. However, the owner should have discussed it first. Since the question is about being in the wrong, technically, the owner might not be at fault, but the method could be improved. So the answer is B.\n"
