I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. \n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish regularly and leaves the vegetables untouched. The owner notices the waste and decides to adjust the portion of vegetables. The customer gets upset when there are fewer vegetables. The owner then complies by making the original dish but ends up wasting the veggies again.\n\nSo, the core issue is about food waste versus customer expectations. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. Even if they don't eat them, the order is what they paid for. The owner's action of altering the dish without prior discussion could be seen as changing the product without the customer's consent. \n\nHowever, the owner might argue that the customer's consistent behavior leads to waste, which is a valid concern. But the problem arises when the owner unilaterally decides to modify the order. The customer expects to receive what they ordered. Not informing them about the change and then adjusting it without their agreement could be seen as a breach of service. \n\nEven if the intention was good (reducing waste), the method was flawed. The owner should have addressed the issue by perhaps asking the customer if they wanted a different version of the dish next time, or maybe offering an alternative that they would eat. Instead, making the change without communication led to the conflict. \n\nSo, the key points are: the customer has a right to receive what they ordered, the owner should have communicated before making changes, and altering the order without consent could lead to conflict. Therefore, the owner is in the wrong for not giving the vegetables as per the original order without discussing it with the customer first.\n"
