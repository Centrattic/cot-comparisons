I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables untouched, leading the owner to throw them away. The owner then decided to reduce the amount of vegetables in the dish for that customer, but the customer got angry and made a scene. The owner then backed down and gave the usual amount again, resulting in waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities of both parties. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, so from a basic perspective, they should receive what they paid for. The shop owner might be concerned about food waste, especially if the vegetables are fresh and can't be saved for later. However, changing the order without the customer's consent could be seen as altering the product, which the customer didn't request. \n\nThe customer didn't specify that they don't eat vegetables, so the owner might not have known. The owner could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer vegetables, but instead, they assumed and changed it unilaterally. That could lead to the customer feeling that their order was not respected. Even if the customer is not eating the vegetables, they might have other reasons for ordering them, like for someone else, or maybe they sometimes eat them but not every time. The owner's action was based on an assumption rather than communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner has a valid concern about waste. If this is a recurring issue and the customer isn't interested in modifying the order, maybe the owner could have had a conversation about it, perhaps offering a different dish that doesn't include vegetables. Alternatively, maybe the customer could be asked if they want the vegetables omitted, but that would require an upfront discussion.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the owner might be in the wrong because they changed the order without the customer's consent, leading to a conflict. The proper approach might have been to communicate rather than assume. However, the customer is also not wrong for expecting to receive the ordered dish, even if they don't eat part of it. The owner's intention was to reduce waste, which is commendable, but the method might not have been appropriate. Therefore, the author (shop owner) might be in the wrong for not communicating and adjusting the order without asking.\n"
