I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables uneaten, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, and the customer got angry. They then made the dish with more veggies again, resulting in waste.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving vegetables. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the standard practice. When someone orders a dish, they expect it to be prepared as per the recipe unless they specify modifications. The customer didn't mention not wanting vegetables before, so altering the dish without prior notice could be an issue. The owner made a unilateral decision to change the dish, which led to the customer's complaint. That might be seen as the owner's fault because the customer paid for the standard dish. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste. If the customer's usual order results in waste, maybe there's a better approach. The owner could have asked the customer if they wanted the standard dish or a modified version. Alternatively, suggesting a different dish without veggies if available. But changing the dish without informing the customer might be considered the owner's mistake. \n\nThe key points are: customer expectations, prior communication, and the responsibility of the business to fulfill the order as ordered. The owner's action of altering the dish without consent could be seen as the wrong move. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
