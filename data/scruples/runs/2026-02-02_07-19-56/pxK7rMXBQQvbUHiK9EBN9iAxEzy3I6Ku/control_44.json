I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the shop owner is in the wrong for reducing the amount of vegetables in the customer's dish because the customer doesn't eat them. \n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish every time and leaves the vegetables. The owner is concerned about food waste and decides to adjust the portion. But the customer got upset, and the owner ended up giving him the regular portion again.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about customer expectations versus the owner's concern for waste. The customer paid for the dish as ordered, so maybe the owner altered the order without the customer's consent. That could be a problem. Customers usually expect to get the dish as it's described. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, the owner isn't supposed to change the recipe without permission. \n\nThe owner might think they're saving money or reducing waste, but the customer's experience is important too. The owner should probably communicate better. Maybe they could ask the customer if they want fewer veggies next time instead of assuming. But the owner didn't do that here, so changing the order without discussing it could be the issue. \n\nAlso, the customer might have a reason for ordering the dish the way it is. Maybe they like the balance of the dish with the veggies, even if they don't eat them. Or maybe they ordered it that way before. The owner's action was well-intentioned, but the method was wrong. So the answer would lean towards the owner being in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the business's policy. If the owner has a policy of not altering orders without consent, then they're following it. But if they don't, then they might be overstepping. Since the customer didn't specify, the owner shouldn't change it. So the answer is A, the owner is in the wrong.\n"
