I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish each time but leaves the vegetables. The owner starts reducing the vegetables to avoid waste, which makes the customer angry. The owner then gives more vegetables again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The owner modified the dish without prior notice. Even though the intention was to reduce waste, altering the order without the customer's consent might be an issue. Customers expect to receive what they ordered. The owner could have asked if they wanted fewer vegetables instead of just changing it. That might have prevented the conflict. However, the customer is also not communicating their preference, which leads to waste. \n\nOn one hand, the owner tried to address waste, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, changing the order without asking could be seen as overstepping. The customer's right to receive their ordered item as presented is important. The owner might have handled it better by discussing options first. So, while both sides have points, the author did act without the customer's consent, which could be considered wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
