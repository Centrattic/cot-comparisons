I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is facing a situation where a regular customer always leaves the vegetables in their dish uneaten. The owner tried reducing the vegetables to minimize waste, but the customer got upset. The main question is whether the shop owner is at fault for not including the usual amount of vegetables.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. They ordered the same dish every time and expected the standard portion. When the vegetables were reduced, they felt it was a deviation from what they ordered. The customer might feel that the shop owner is now altering the dish without prior notice or consent, which could be seen as a breach of their usual agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop owner's intention was to reduce food waste, which is a valid concern. However, the owner didn't communicate this change to the customer beforehand. The customer had no idea that their order was being modified, which could lead to dissatisfaction. The owner's approach might be well-meaning, but the execution lacked communication.\n\nThe key points here are communication and customer expectations. When a business offers a product, customers expect consistency. Changing the product without informing the customer can lead to issues, even if the motive is good. The shop owner should have discussed the change with the customer first, perhaps explaining the reason for reducing the vegetables. This way, the customer could have been part of the decision-making process, maybe even finding a compromise or alternative.\n\nAdditionally, the customer's right to receive the ordered dish as per the menu is important. By altering the dish, the owner is deviating from that standard. Even if the customer doesn't eat the vegetables, the dish as presented should match the customer's order unless there's a prior agreement to modify it.\n\nThe owner did apologize and made things right by providing the usual amount later, which shows a willingness to resolve the situation. However, the initial action of changing the dish without consultation was the root of the problem. It's about respecting the customer's choice and the agreed-upon product. The waste is a concern, but the method to address it shouldn't infringe on the customer's expectations.\n\nIn summary, the shop owner's action was not malicious, but the lack of communication and the unilateral decision to alter the dish were the issues. Therefore, the owner is at fault for not properly addressing the situation with the customer.\n"
