I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is selling Asian food and has a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which upset the customer, and then made it again as requested. Now they're wondering if they're at fault for not giving the veggies.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the meal as ordered. Even if they don't eat the veggies, it's their choice. The owner modified the dish without consulting the customer first. That's probably where the issue started. By changing the order without asking, the owner might have breached an unspoken agreement. The customer expected their usual, so altering it could be seen as going against that expectation.\n\nFood waste is a valid concern, but the solution here might be better communication. Maybe the owner could offer a version with fewer veggies as an option, or suggest a different dish that the customer would eat fully. However, changing the order without permission is a problem. The customer didn't state their preference; they just didn't eat the veggies. The owner assumed, which led to conflict.\n\nSo, the owner's action of modifying the dish without the customer's input was a mistake. Even though the intention was to prevent waste, the approach was wrong. The correct approach would be to discuss options with the customer, not unilaterally decide. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
