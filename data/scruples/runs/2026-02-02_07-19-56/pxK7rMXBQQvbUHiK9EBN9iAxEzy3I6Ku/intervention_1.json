I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner (the author) is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish regularly but leaves the vegetables. The shop owner starts reducing the veggies to cut waste, which upsets the customer. The owner then apologizes and gives more veggies, leading to waste again.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The customer paid for the dish as ordered, so the owner might be altering the product without permission. The customer might expect consistency. However, the owner has a valid point about food waste. But is it the owner's responsibility to adjust the dish to the customer's preferences without prior notice?\n\nAlso, the customer didn't communicate their preference not to have veggies. Maybe the owner should have asked first instead of changing the order. The owner could have offered a different option or charged less if the veggies were removed. But they didn't, so changing it without consent might be an issue. \n\nThe customer making a scene is their reaction, but that doesn't make the owner right or wrong. The key is whether altering the order without consent is acceptable. In most cases, businesses should provide what's ordered unless there's a way to accommodate preferences with prior agreement. So the owner didn't handle it correctly. They should have communicated first. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
