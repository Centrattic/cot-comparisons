I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the shop owner (the author) is in the wrong for not giving the customer vegetables because the customer leaves them uneaten. \n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish every time but never eats the vegetables. The owner is throwing them away each time. Then, the owner decides to cook less vegetables for the customer to reduce waste. The customer gets angry, there's a scene, and the owner ends up making the dish with more veggies again, leading to waste.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the customer is paying for the dish as ordered, but not eating part of it. The owner changes the dish without the customer's consent, leading to conflict. \n\nI think that when a customer orders a dish, they expect to receive it as it's normally prepared unless they specify modifications. The owner made a change without consulting the customer, which caused the problem. Even though the owner's intention was to reduce waste, altering the dish without the customer's agreement might be the issue here. The customer might have ordered the dish with vegetables included, perhaps not realizing they could request fewer veggies, or maybe they want them for another reason (like taking them home later, or maybe they just don't like them but don't want to ask for a modification). \n\nAlso, the owner's reasoning is that it's wasteful, but the customer is the one paying for the dish. The owner could have approached the customer and asked if they wanted fewer vegetables, but changing it without permission led to conflict. So maybe the problem is that the owner acted unilaterally. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer isn't asking for a change and is causing consistent waste. But the customer has the right to receive the dish as ordered unless they modify their order. The owner might be within their rights to ask the customer if they want modifications, but changing it without asking isn't good practice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they altered the customer's order without permission, leading to the conflict. The correct approach would have been to communicate with the customer about the issue first. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
