I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is getting annoyed because a regular customer always leaves the vegetables on his dish. The owner tried to adjust by giving fewer vegetables, but the customer got upset. The owner is wondering if they were wrong not to include the vegetables.\n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish each time, which includes vegetables. The owner's responsibility is to prepare the dish as ordered. If the customer doesn't eat the vegetables, that's their choice, but the owner is still expected to fulfill the order as requested. Changing the order without prior notice might be a breach of service. The customer paid for the full dish, so even if they don't eat part of it, the owner is still providing the meal they paid for. \n\nThe owner's intention was to reduce waste, which is understandable, but altering the dish without discussing it with the customer first could be problematic. The customer might have expected the same dish each time, and the change led to dissatisfaction. The owner could have approached the situation differently, like asking the customer if they wanted to modify the order or offering a different dish without vegetables. Instead, making a unilateral decision to reduce vegetables caused conflict. \n\nSo, the key points are: fulfilling the order as requested, communication, and the right to expect the same product when ordering a regular dish. The owner might have a valid point about waste, but the method of addressing it was flawed. Therefore, the answer is likely that the owner is in the wrong.\n"
