I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving the customer the usual amount of vegetables. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe customer orders the same dish repeatedly. Every time, he leaves the vegetables untouched, so the owner ends up throwing them away. The owner then decided to cook less vegetables for him one time, leading to the customer getting angry. The owner explained that since the customer never eats the veggies, there's no point in overcooking. The customer made a scene, and the owner had to give him the regular amount again, resulting in waste once more.\n\nThe main question is whether the owner is at fault here. The owner's reasoning is about reducing food waste. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, but not eating the vegetables. The owner changed the order without consulting the customer first, which led to a disagreement.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, businesses typically have to fulfill the customer's order as placed. If the dish has vegetables, and the customer hasn't mentioned modifying it before, altering the order without prior discussion could be seen as a breach of what the customer expects. The customer might feel that the dish is incomplete or that they're being denied part of their meal, even if they don't eat the veggies. On the other hand, the owner is trying to prevent waste, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut legally and ethically, does the owner have the right to modify the order based on previous observations? Probably not. The standard practice is that customers get what they order unless they specify a change. The owner could have approached the customer first to ask if they wanted the vegetables omitted or reduced, but changing it unilaterally might be seen as overstepping. The customer paid for the full dish, so the owner might be in the wrong for altering it without permission. The waste is unfortunate, but the owner's method of addressing it was inappropriate. The correct approach would be to discuss with the customer, maybe offer options, or charge differently if they want modifications. So I think the owner is in the wrong here.\n"
