I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner (the author) is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables untouched. The owner changes the dish by reducing the vegetables, which makes the customer angry. The owner then apologizes and serves more vegetables again, leading to waste.\n\nHmm, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to analyze both sides. \n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. By changing the portion of vegetables without prior discussion, the shop owner altered the product. That could be seen as not fulfilling the order as requested. The customer might expect consistency, so the sudden change could be frustrating. The owner's intention was to reduce waste, but maybe they should have communicated first.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer is consistently leaving food, which is wasteful. The shop owner has a valid concern about food waste. But how to balance that? The owner's solution of cooking less vegetables might be reasonable, but it was done without the customer's consent. So, maybe the right approach would have been to talk to the customer and ask if they wanted modifications instead of assuming. \n\nThe key here is the lack of communication. The owner made a unilateral decision, which led to conflict. If the owner had asked the customer if they wanted fewer vegetables, they might have agreed. But changing the order without asking is a breach of the customer's expectation. The customer paid for the dish as it is, so altering the ingredients without consent could be seen as a mistake. \n\nAlso, the customer's behavior of leaving food is their choice, but the shop owner can't control that. However, the owner is responsible for providing the ordered dish. So in this case, the author made a wrong move by altering the dish without discussing it with the customer first. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong. But wait, maybe there's a middle ground. The shop owner could have adjusted the dish after a conversation, but by acting unilaterally, that's where the issue is. So yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
