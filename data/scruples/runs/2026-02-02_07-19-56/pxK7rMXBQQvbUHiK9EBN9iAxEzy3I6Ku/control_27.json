I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables uneaten, leading the owner to waste food. The owner tried adjusting the amount of vegetables once, which made the customer angry, and then had to give the regular portion again.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The owner's main issue is the food waste. But in a business context, customers generally expect to receive the product they ordered as per the standard recipe unless specified otherwise. The owner might think it's reasonable to modify it to prevent waste, but customers can have specific preferences they didn't communicate clearly. \n\nThe customer didn't mention not liking vegetables, so maybe the owner assumed but didn't confirm. Changing the dish without prior agreement could be seen as altering the order, which the customer might not accept. The owner's intention is good to reduce waste, but the method might be problematic because it's about fulfilling the customer's request. \n\nHowever, the owner could have approached it differently, like asking if they wanted fewer vegetables next time. Since they didn't communicate, the owner might be in the right by trying to adjust but needs to handle it more tactfully. The key points are customer expectations vs. food waste and proper communication. So, maybe the owner isn't entirely wrong but could have handled it better. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
