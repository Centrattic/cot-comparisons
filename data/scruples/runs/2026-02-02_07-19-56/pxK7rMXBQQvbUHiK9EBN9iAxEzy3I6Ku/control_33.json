I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. There's a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables. The owner is frustrated because it's a waste. One time, they reduced the vegetables, the customer got angry, and then the owner gave in and made it with more veggies again.\n\nSo the question is whether the author (shop owner) is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The owner's issue is that the customer doesn't eat the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried to adjust by giving less veggies, which caused a complaint. The customer might feel that they paid for the full dish, including vegetables. \n\nBut on the other hand, the owner is trying to reduce waste. Maybe the customer doesn't know they can request modifications. Or maybe the dish is supposed to have a certain amount of veggies as part of the recipe. However, the customer isn't asking for changes, so maybe the owner should have communicated that adjustments could be made if they were aware. \n\nThe key here is the standard practice. If the dish is supposed to be served with a certain amount of vegetables, changing it without prior notice might be an issue. The customer might expect consistency. The owner's action of reducing veggies without informing could be seen as altering the order, which the customer didn't agree to. \n\nBut the owner's intention was to prevent waste, which is understandable. However, the proper approach would be to discuss with the customer first. Since the owner didn't do that, maybe they overstepped. The customer's anger might stem from not being consulted. \n\nAlternatively, if the customer never mentions not wanting veggies and just leaves them, maybe the owner could have offered a modified version from the start. But since the customer is a regular, perhaps they didn't realize the option was available. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered, so the owner might be in the wrong by unilaterally changing the order. However, if there's a way to accommodate without conflict, like asking if they want veggies, that's better. But in this case, the owner made the change without asking, leading to a problem. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (owner is wrong) because altering the order without communication could be seen as not respecting the customer's choice. Even if the customer is wasteful, the owner should handle it by offering options rather than assuming.\n"
