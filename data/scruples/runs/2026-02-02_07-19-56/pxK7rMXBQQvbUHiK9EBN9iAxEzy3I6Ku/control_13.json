I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables untouched. The owner starts to give fewer vegetables to avoid waste, but the customer gets angry. The owner then complies by adding more vegetables, ending up with waste again.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: The customer is paying for the dish as ordered. If the dish includes vegetables as part of the standard recipe, the owner might be altering the product without the customer's consent. That could be a problem because the customer expects what they ordered. However, maybe the dish is customizable, and the owner is making a change based on the customer's past behavior.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between food waste and customer expectations. The owner is trying to reduce waste, which is commendable. But the customer might expect consistency in their order. The owner's initial decision to adjust the vegetables without discussing it with the customer could be seen as overstepping. The customer might have reasons for ordering the dish with vegetables even if they don't eat them now\u2014maybe for health reasons, or maybe they sometimes eat them. The owner made an assumption without confirming.\n\nCommunication is key here. The owner could have discussed the issue with the customer to find a solution, like offering a modified dish at a different price or suggesting alternatives. Instead, the owner made a unilateral decision, leading to a conflict. The customer's reaction might be due to feeling that their order was altered without permission, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's action of changing the dish without the customer's agreement might be in the wrong, even if the intention was good. The correct approach would have been to communicate and negotiate rather than alter the order without consent.\n"
