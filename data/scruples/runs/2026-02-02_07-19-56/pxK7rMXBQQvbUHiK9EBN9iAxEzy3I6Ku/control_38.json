I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables untouched, so the owner ends up throwing them away each time. The owner tried reducing the vegetables to minimize waste, but the customer got angry. Then, the owner gave in and made the dish with more veggies, leading to the same problem.\n\nThe question is whether the owner is in the wrong (AITA) for not giving vegetables. Choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The customer ordered the dish as usual and expected the same amount. The owner modified the order without prior notice, which the customer found unacceptably. The owner's intention was to reduce waste, but the action was taken without the customer's consent. \n\nIn business, customers have the right to receive what they ordered. Changing the order without communication might be seen as a breach of expectations, even if the reason is good. The owner could have approached the customer in a different way, like asking if they wanted to modify the order next time or suggesting a different preparation that avoids waste. \n\nBut the owner is also concerned about food waste, which is a valid issue. However, the method used here was to unilaterally change the order, which might be considered inconsiderate. The customer might not know that the veggies are being thrown away each time, so assuming they don't mind reducing veggies isn't fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer could have communicated their preference to the owner earlier. But the owner's responsibility is to deliver what's ordered unless there's prior agreement. Without that, the owner might be in the wrong for altering the order. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (yes), because the owner didn't communicate the change and the customer was entitled to their usual dish. However, there's a valid point about food waste. But the main issue here is the lack of communication and going against the customer's standard order without their input. The customer's anger is a reaction to the unexpected change, so the owner's action was the trigger. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
