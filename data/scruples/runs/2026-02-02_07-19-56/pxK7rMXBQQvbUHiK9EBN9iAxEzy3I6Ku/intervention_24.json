I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. They have a regular customer who orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables untouched. The owner, frustrated by the waste, decides to cook fewer vegetables next time. The customer gets angry, and the owner ends up giving him the usual dish again, leading to waste once more.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the owner is in the wrong. The key points here are customer expectations, food waste, and business ethics. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. By altering the dish without prior notice, the owner changed the product the customer was paying for. Even though the owner's intention was to reduce waste, the customer might have expected the full dish as ordered. \n\nThe owner's action could be seen as a breach of the implicit contract between a business and its customers\u2014that when you order a dish, you receive what's on the menu. Altering it without consulting the customer might be perceived as disrespectful to their choice. However, the customer's consistent waste is also a valid concern. Maybe the owner should have addressed the issue differently, like asking the customer if they wanted the vegetables or offering a modified version at a different price.\n\nBut the owner did make a unilateral decision to change the dish, which led to a conflict. The customer had the right to expect consistency. Even if the owner's intention was good, changing the dish without agreement could be considered wrong. The owner should have communicated better. However, there's also an argument that the owner is trying to prevent waste, which is a responsible action. \n\nSo, there's a balance here. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because they're trying to address waste, but they handled it poorly. However, the core issue is whether the customer is entitled to the full dish as ordered. Since the customer is paying for the item as presented, the owner might be in the wrong for not providing it as ordered. But the situation is nuanced. Maybe the answer hinges on whether the dish's description includes the vegetables as a necessary component. If the vegetables are part of the dish, then the customer expects them. If they're just a garnish, maybe not. The context here says \"different kinds of Asian food,\" which often include vegetables as part of the main dish.\n\nIn conclusion, the owner's action was to modify the dish without the customer's consent, leading to the customer's dissatisfaction. Since the customer pays for the dish as ordered, the owner is in the wrong for not providing it as described. The proper approach would have been to discuss options with the customer rather than altering the order without notice.\n"
