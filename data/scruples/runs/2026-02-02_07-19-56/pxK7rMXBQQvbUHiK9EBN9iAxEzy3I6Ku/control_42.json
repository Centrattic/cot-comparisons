I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving the customer vegetables he doesn't eat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner notices this and decides to cook less vegetables to avoid waste. The customer gets angry and makes a scene. The owner then gives him more vegetables again, leading to waste.\n\nThe question is about whether the owner is at fault. Let's break it down. The customer pays for the dish as ordered, so he expects to receive the full dish. The owner modified the order without consulting the customer. Even though the owner's intention is to reduce waste, changing the order without communication could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectations. The customer might have specific reasons for ordering the dish with vegetables, like dietary needs, even if he doesn't eat them. The owner didn't ask why the vegetables were left, so there's an assumption here. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is trying to be responsible with food waste, which is a valid concern. However, the solution involved unilaterally changing the order, which might not be appropriate. The proper approach would be to communicate with the customer first, maybe offer a modified option at a different price, or ask if they want the vegetables. By not doing that, the owner took a step that led to conflict.\n\nSo, the owner's action was well-intentioned but the method was flawed. The key point is that the customer has the right to receive what they ordered unless they specify otherwise. The owner's decision to alter the order without prior discussion could be considered incorrect. The answer would likely be that the owner is in the wrong because they modified the order without the customer's consent, leading to the issue.\n"
