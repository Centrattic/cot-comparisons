I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a regular customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which upset the customer. Now the owner is conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The owner's role is to provide what's on the menu. If the dish includes vegetables, then the customer expects that. Even if the customer doesn't eat them, they paid for it. The owner altered the dish without prior notice, which might be against standard practice. Customers usually want their orders as presented. \n\nThen, when the customer got upset, the owner gave in and made it with more veggies again. That shows maybe the owner realized changing the order without consent wasn't right. Also, the owner's reasoning is about food waste, which is a valid concern, but the method might be off. Maybe the solution is to let the customer order without veggies if possible, or add a note next time. But changing the dish without asking could be seen as not respecting the customer's order. \n\nSo the key points are: the owner changed the order without the customer's permission, leading to a conflict. The customer has the right to their ordered meal. Even if the owner is trying to reduce waste, the method might be inappropriate. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong for not following the standard order and causing a scene.\n"
