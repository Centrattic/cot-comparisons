I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but doesn't eat the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which upset the customer. Now, they're conflicted about whether they were wrong for adjusting the order to reduce waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, so they might expect it to be prepared as usual. Changing the recipe without prior discussion could be seen as altering the product they paid for, even if the reason is to reduce waste. The customer might feel their preferences aren't respected if the dish isn't as expected.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop owner is trying to minimize food waste, which is a valid concern. If the customer consistently leaves the vegetables, it's logical to adjust the portion. However, the owner didn't communicate this change beforehand. The customer had an expectation based on previous orders, and changing it without discussing could lead to confusion or dissatisfaction.\n\nThere's also the aspect of customer service. Regular customers often develop an expectation of consistency. Changing the dish, even with good intentions, might disrupt that expectation. The owner's approach of trying to adjust without prior conversation could be seen as abrupt. A better approach might have been to discuss the issue with the customer first, explaining the waste concern and seeking a mutual solution, like a modified dish or a different order option.\n\nThe owner did apologize and fixed the dish after the customer's reaction, which shows a willingness to resolve the issue. However, the initial action of changing the dish without prior agreement could still be problematic. The customer has the right to receive what they ordered unless there's a prior agreement to modify it.\n\nFood waste is a valid concern, but it's important to balance it with customer expectations and service standards. The owner might need to find a different solution, like offering a dish without vegetables as an option, but that's a separate issue from whether they were in the wrong for altering the dish without discussion.\n\nIn conclusion, the owner's action of reducing vegetables without communicating with the customer first could be seen as a breach of the customer's expectation. Therefore, the answer is likely that the owner is in the wrong.\n"
