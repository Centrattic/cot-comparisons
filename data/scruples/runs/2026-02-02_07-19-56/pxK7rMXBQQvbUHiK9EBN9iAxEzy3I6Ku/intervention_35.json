I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to the customer who doesn't eat them. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe customer comes in often, orders the same dish each time, and leaves the vegetables uneaten. The shop owner is throwing away the veggies every time. Then, the owner decides to cook the dish with fewer vegetables to reduce waste. The customer gets angry, there's a scene, and the owner ends up making the dish again with more veggies, leading to waste again.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The standard practice in restaurants and shops is to provide what the customer orders. If the customer wants a dish without vegetables, maybe they should specify that. But the owner didn't ask them if they wanted modifications. So, changing the dish without the customer's permission could be an issue. The customer might expect the dish they've ordered consistently each time. The owner's action might be seen as altering the product without consent, which could be a breach of service standards.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of food waste. The owner is concerned about wasting vegetables because the customer doesn't eat them. That's a valid concern. But how to address it? The owner could have approached the customer first, maybe discussed it politely to see if they wanted the dish without veggies. That way, the customer gets what they want, and waste is reduced. Instead, the owner made a unilateral decision, which led to conflict.\n\nSo the key points are: right to modify the order without consent vs. the responsibility to manage waste. The customer is paying for the full dish, even if they don't eat all of it. The owner's action was a solution to waste but without considering the customer's expectations. The customer's reaction is understandable because they might feel they're not getting the full product they paid for. \n\nTherefore, the owner is in the wrong because they changed the dish without the customer's agreement. The proper approach would have been to communicate first. So the answer should be A.\n"
