I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is trying to reduce food waste by giving the customer a dish with fewer vegetables since the customer leaves them uneaten every time. The customer got upset and made a scene when the vegetables were reduced. The owner had to revert to the original dish, leading to more waste.\n\nFirst, the customer is ordering the same dish as usual, so they expect consistency. The owner changed the order without prior notice, which could be seen as altering the customer's order without consent. Even if the intention was good, changing the dish's composition might violate the customer's expectations. The customer has a right to receive the dish as ordered, unless they specified modifications. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about waste. It's understandable to want to avoid throwing away food. However, the solution here might have been to ask the customer if they wanted the vegetables reduced next time, instead of assuming. The owner could have initiated a conversation to find a middle ground, like adjusting the portion size or offering a different version of the dish. \n\nThe customer's reaction might be justified if they felt the dish was altered without their permission. They might not be aware of the waste issue or might prefer the dish with more vegetables for taste or other reasons. The owner's approach was abrupt, which led to conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, businesses generally need to honor customer orders as placed. If the customer hadn't communicated their preference to adjust the vegetables, the owner shouldn't unilaterally change it. The right approach would have been to discuss it first. So, the owner's action was a bit presumptuous and may have infringed on the customer's choice. Therefore, the owner is in the wrong.\n"
