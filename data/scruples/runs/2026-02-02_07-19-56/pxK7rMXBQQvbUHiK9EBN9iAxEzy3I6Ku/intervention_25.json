I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time, leaves the vegetables untouched, and the owner throws them away. So the owner decided to cook the dish with fewer vegetables the next time, which made the customer angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered. If the dish includes vegetables as part of the standard recipe, the customer expects to receive that. By altering the dish without prior notice, the owner might be seen as not fulfilling the order. Even if the customer doesn't eat the vegetables, they might feel it's part of the meal they paid for. The owner's intention was to reduce waste, but changing the order without consulting the customer could be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional.\n\nThen there's the aspect of food waste. The owner is concerned about waste, which is valid. However, the solution was to adjust the dish without the customer's consent. Maybe there could have been a better approach, like asking the customer if they want vegetables, or perhaps offering a modified dish at the time of ordering. Since the owner didn't communicate this change, the customer might have felt it was an unannounced alteration. \n\nThe customer's reaction was anger, which suggests they felt their order was not respected. The owner then had to backtrack and provide the full dish again, leading to waste. So, even though the owner's intention was to be responsible with resources, the method was flawed. \n\nIn terms of business practices, customers expect consistency in their orders. If a business wants to modify an item, especially for a regular customer, they should discuss it first. The owner might not be in the wrong in a legal sense, but from a customer service standpoint, it's a misstep. The customer paid for the dish as it was, so the owner's action could be seen as altering the product without agreement. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they changed the order without the customer's consent, leading to conflict. The right approach would have been communication rather than unilateral action.\n"
