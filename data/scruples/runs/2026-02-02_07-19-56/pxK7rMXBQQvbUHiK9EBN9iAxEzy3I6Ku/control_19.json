I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is at fault for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, and the customer got angry. Now they're back to the same problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop owner's perspective. They're trying to reduce waste. It's a common issue where people order things they don't eat. The owner probably feels frustrated because they're paying for the ingredients and it's going to waste. But when they changed the order without consulting the customer, that led to a conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the customer paid for the dish as ordered. The shop owner modified the dish without the customer's consent, which could be seen as altering the product without agreement. Customers generally expect to receive what they ordered unless there's prior arrangement. The owner's action might have breached the customer's expectations. \n\nBut then, the owner had a valid reason to minimize waste. However, the right approach might have been to discuss with the customer first. Maybe ask if they could adjust the dish to avoid waste. Instead, the owner made the change unilaterally, leading to the customer's anger. \n\nThe customer's reaction is also part of the issue. They didn't communicate their dislike of vegetables earlier. If they had mentioned it, the owner could have adjusted the dish. But the owner's responsibility is to provide the ordered dish unless there's a prior arrangement or a special request. \n\nSo, the key points are: the owner altered the order without the customer's consent, leading to the customer's dissatisfaction. While the intention to reduce waste is commendable, the method was flawed. The owner should have communicated first. Therefore, the owner might be at fault for not giving the customer a choice in the modification. \n\nBut is it the owner's fault entirely? The customer also didn't inform the staff about not wanting vegetables. However, the shop owner's responsibility is to fulfill the order as placed unless modified with agreement. Hence, the owner is in the wrong for changing the dish without prior discussion. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
