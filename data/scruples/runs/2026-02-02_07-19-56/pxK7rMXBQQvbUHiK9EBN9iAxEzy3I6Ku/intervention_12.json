I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the shop owner is at fault for reducing the vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer doesn't eat them. The customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner tried modifying the dish but the customer got angry. So, is the owner in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of service. When a customer orders a dish, they expect it to be prepared as usual unless they specify modifications. The owner made a change without the customer's consent, which might be an issue. Customers have the right to expect consistency in their orders. Altering the dish without prior discussion could be seen as a breach of that expectation.\n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The owner didn't talk to the customer first about the change. Even if the owner had a valid reason (like reducing waste), they should have discussed it with the customer to adjust the order. The customer might have preferences or reasons for ordering the dish the way it is, which the owner isn't considering.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's responsibility. The customer is paying for the dish, including the vegetables, even if they don't eat them. While it's wasteful, the customer's choice to order the dish as it is means they might not want modifications. The owner's unilateral decision to change the dish could be seen as overstepping.\n\nHowever, the owner's intent to reduce waste is understandable. Maybe the owner could have suggested a modified version beforehand. But in this case, they acted without asking, leading to the customer's anger. So the main issue is the lack of communication and consent.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the customer isn't wrong for getting upset if their order was altered without their knowledge. The owner has a duty to provide the ordered dish unless changes are requested. Therefore, the owner might be at fault for not following the customer's order as given.\n"
