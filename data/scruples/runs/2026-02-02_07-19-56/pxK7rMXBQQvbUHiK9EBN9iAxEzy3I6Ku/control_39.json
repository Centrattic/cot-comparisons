I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving the customer vegetables. The situation is that the customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables, so the owner tried reducing the veggies to avoid waste. The customer got angry, and the owner then made the full dish again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The customer pays for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. The owner modified the order without prior communication. Normally, when a customer orders something, they expect to receive it as per their order. Changing the order without consent could be seen as a breach of what the customer paid for. However, the owner's reasoning is about food waste, which is a valid concern.\n\nBut here's the catch: the owner has the right to manage their business and reduce waste. However, altering the order without the customer's agreement might be problematic. The customer might feel they were not given what they paid for. The owner could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer vegetables instead of assuming. The owner did explain the reason, but that might not be enough. The customer's right to receive the ordered dish as per the menu is important. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, the order was for the full dish. The owner's action was to modify the order without prior agreement, leading to the customer's reaction. So, the owner might be in the wrong because they changed the order without the customer's consent. However, the owner's intention was to reduce waste, which is understandable. But the method was flawed. The correct approach would be to discuss with the customer in advance or offer alternatives, like a side without veggies. Since the owner didn't do that, they might be in the wrong. But there's also an argument that the owner is trying to be efficient. It's a bit of a grey area, but generally, changing the order without consent could be seen as the owner's fault.\n"
