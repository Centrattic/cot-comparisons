I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The customer orders the same dish regularly but leaves the veggies every time. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, which made the customer angry. Then the owner complied again, leading to waste.\n\nSo, the key points here are food waste and customer expectations. The customer is paying the same amount but not consuming part of the dish. The shop owner is trying to minimize waste by adjusting the portion, but the customer got upset. \n\nFirst, from a business perspective, customers typically expect to get what they ordered. If the dish is supposed to include vegetables, removing them without prior notice might be seen as altering the product. The owner didn't discuss this with the customer beforehand, which could have prevented the scene. \n\nHowever, the owner has a valid concern about food waste. It's a common issue in the food industry. Maybe there's a middle ground, like asking the customer if they want fewer veggies next time, or perhaps offering a different dish without veggies. But in this case, the owner didn't communicate the change, leading to the customer's anger. \n\nThe question is whether the owner was wrong. Legally, if the customer paid for the dish as advertised, the owner might be obligated to provide the full dish. But ethically, the owner is trying to reduce waste, which is commendable. However, the approach was flawed because it wasn't communicated. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the owner is in the wrong) because they altered the dish without informing the customer, leading to dissatisfaction. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the intention was to prevent waste and the customer's reaction was unreasonable. \n\nBut considering standard consumer expectations, the owner should provide what's ordered unless there's prior agreement. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
