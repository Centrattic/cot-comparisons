I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the shop owner usually includes vegetables in a dish that a regular customer orders. The customer doesn't eat the vegetables and they get thrown away each time. The owner decides one day to give fewer vegetables, which upsets the customer. The owner then complies with the original order and ends up wasting the vegetables again.\n\nSo the question is: Is the shop owner at fault for not giving vegetables? The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, standard practice is that when a customer orders something, they expect to receive that exact dish. The customer might not like the vegetables, but they ordered the dish as a whole. The shop owner's modification without prior consultation could be seen as altering the customer's order without consent. That's probably why the customer got angry. The owner made an assumption that the customer didn't want vegetables, but the customer might not have communicated that preference. \n\nThen there's the issue of food waste. The owner is trying to be responsible by not overcooking vegetables, but the method of doing so without discussing with the customer led to a problem. Maybe the proper approach would have been to ask the customer if they wanted to modify the order, like adding a note to the dish or creating a version without vegetables. However, the customer might not have realized that they could request such a modification. \n\nAnother angle: the shop owner is in a business where customer satisfaction is key. Changing an order without the customer's knowledge can damage the relationship. Even if the customer didn't specify their dislike for vegetables earlier, the shop owner should have asked for their preference rather than making a unilateral decision. The customer likely expected the dish as prepared before and was surprised by the change.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop owner is also trying to avoid waste, which is a valid concern. However, the solution here wasn't communicated properly. The owner could have approached the customer beforehand to discuss options, like offering to adjust the dish or suggesting alternatives. By not doing so, the owner took an action that led to customer dissatisfaction.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the shop owner made an attempt to solve the problem of waste without consulting the customer. Modifying the order without consent is a breach of the customer's expectations. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they altered the order without discussing it with the customer first. The answer should be A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
