I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner starts giving fewer vegetables to reduce waste, but the customer gets angry. The owner then complies by adding more veggies again, leading to waste.\n\nFirst, the owner did try to address the issue by adjusting the portion size. But the customer was upset. The main question is whether the owner was in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, the customer paid for the dish as ordered, and altering the order without consultation might be seen as changing the product without permission. The customer might have expected the same item each time. So the owner didn't follow the order as given, which could be a breach of service.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste. If the customer consistently leaves the veggies, it's a valid concern. However, the right approach might have been to discuss with the customer first. Maybe offer a substitute or a different portion size based on prior discussion. Without communication, changing the order could be seen as a mistake.\n\nThe owner could argue that the customer's behavior leads to waste, but legally and ethically, the customer's order as given is what should be fulfilled. Adjusting it without consent might be problematic. The owner might have a valid point about waste, but the method of addressing it was flawed. The correct step would be to talk to the customer, not alter the order unilaterally.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether altering the order without the customer's consent is a breach. Since the customer paid for the standard dish, the owner should provide what was ordered. The owner's approach was to change the order without discussion, which is where the mistake lies. Therefore, the answer is A (the owner is in the wrong).\n"
