I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner (the author) is in the wrong for reducing the vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer always leaves them. The customer got angry when the vegetables were reduced, made a scene, and the owner ended up cooking the original amount again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's rights. When someone orders a dish, they expect to receive what's on the menu. Changing the recipe without prior notice might be seen as not fulfilling the order. The customer might feel their order was altered without consent, hence the anger. \n\nOn the other hand, the shop owner is concerned about food waste. If the customer consistently leaves the vegetables, the owner might be trying to reduce waste by adjusting the portion. But the owner could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer vegetables instead of just changing it. That way, the customer could have made a choice. \n\nThe owner's approach was a bit abrupt. Communication is key here. Instead of modifying the dish without discussing it, the owner could have had a conversation with the customer about their preference. That would have been a more respectful approach. \n\nAlso, the fact that the customer pays normally and isn't rude means that the issue isn't about bad behavior. The owner's action, while well-intentioned, might have crossed a line by unilaterally changing the dish, leading to a conflict. \n\nSo, while the owner's intention was to prevent waste, the method used was problematic. The customer's right to receive their ordered dish as presented is important. The owner should handle such requests through communication first, not by altering the order without consent. Hence, the owner is in the wrong here.\n"
