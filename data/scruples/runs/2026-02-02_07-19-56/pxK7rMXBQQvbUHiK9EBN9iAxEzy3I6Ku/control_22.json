I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is frustrated because a regular customer consistently leaves the vegetables in their dish uneaten. The owner tried reducing the vegetables to avoid waste, but the customer got upset. Now the owner is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish every time. The dish includes vegetables, which the customer doesn't eat. The owner thinks it's a waste and decides to adjust the portion. But when they do, the customer gets angry. The owner then apologizes and makes the dish as usual, leading to the same waste.\n\nSo, is the owner in the wrong? Well, the customer pays for the full dish, including vegetables. The owner changing the order without prior communication might be the issue. The customer might have specific preferences or dietary reasons for ordering the dish the way it is, even if they don't eat the veggies. The owner has a responsibility to fulfill the customer's order as ordered. By altering the dish without discussing it with the customer first, the owner may have breached that agreement. \n\nHowever, there's a valid concern about food waste. The owner is trying to be efficient, which makes sense. But the right approach would have been to communicate with the customer first, ask if they could adjust the dish to reduce waste, rather than making the change unilaterally. That way, the owner could have addressed the waste without causing a scene. \n\nThe customer's reaction might be because they expect the dish to be consistent. If they wanted fewer vegetables, they should have specified that when ordering. But the owner also has the responsibility to serve the customer's order as given. So, in this case, the owner might be in the wrong for changing the order without discussion. The customer isn't wrong for being upset when the dish isn't as expected. The owner should have communicated first. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
