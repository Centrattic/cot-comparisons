I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is selling Asian food, and a regular customer orders the same dish each time but leaves the vegetables. The owner is frustrated because this leads to food waste. So, one day, the owner decides to cook the dish with fewer vegetables, which upsets the customer. The owner then gives in and makes the dish as usual, resulting in waste again.\n\nFirst, the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The owner's change in the recipe without prior communication could be an issue. The customer might expect consistency in what they ordered. The owner's reasoning is about avoiding waste, but modifying the dish without the customer's consent could be seen as not respecting the order. \n\nHowever, the customer is not eating the vegetables either, which is a point in the owner's favor. The owner might argue that they're adapting to prevent waste. But the problem arises when they made the change without talking to the customer first. The customer's reaction suggests they valued the vegetables in their dish, perhaps for health reasons, dietary preferences, or personal taste. \n\nThe key here is the expectation vs. the change. The customer ordered the same dish each time, expecting it to be prepared as usual. Changing the recipe without discussion might breach that unspoken agreement. Additionally, food waste is a valid concern, but the solution should ideally involve communication. The owner could have offered a different dish without vegetables or suggested using the leftover vegetables for other customers, but altering the dish without consent might be the wrong approach. \n\nSo, while the owner's intent is understandable, the action of changing the dish without the customer's input is where the mistake lies. The correct approach would be to discuss options rather than make unilateral changes, even with good intentions.\n"
