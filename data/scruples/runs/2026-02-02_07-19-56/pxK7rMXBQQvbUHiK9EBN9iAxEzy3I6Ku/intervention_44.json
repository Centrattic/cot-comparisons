I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner (the author) is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables, causing waste. The author decided to cook less vegetables one time, which made the customer angry. Then they gave in and made more veggies again.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the customer's rights. When you order a dish, you expect to get what's on the menu. If the dish includes vegetables, changing that without the customer's consent might be an issue. The customer might have ordered it expecting the standard portion. So the author altered the order without asking, which could be a problem.\n\nBut then there's the food waste angle. The author is concerned about throwing away food every time. That's a valid concern, especially in today's world where sustainability is important. However, the customer is paying for the full dish, including the vegetables they don't eat. So maybe the customer is the one causing waste by not eating them, but the author can't force them to eat it.\n\nThe author's approach was to adjust the order without prior communication. Maybe they should have talked to the customer first, explaining the issue and offering alternatives, like cooking a different version of the dish without vegetables. That way, the customer could decide whether they want to pay for a modified dish or not.\n\nAlso, when the customer got angry, the author gave in and made the original dish again. That shows they tried to de-escalate the situation, which is good. But maybe the problem is that the author didn't handle it proactively by communicating their concerns earlier.\n\nSo the key points are: Did the author have the right to alter the dish without the customer's consent? Probably not. The customer has the right to receive what they ordered unless there's prior agreement to modify it. The author's action led to a conflict, which could have been avoided by discussing the issue first. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating and changing the order without asking.\n"
