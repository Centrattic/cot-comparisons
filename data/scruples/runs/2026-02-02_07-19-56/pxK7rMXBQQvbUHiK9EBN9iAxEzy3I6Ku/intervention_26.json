I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for adjusting the amount of vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer never eats them.\n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish regularly, always leaves the veggies, and the owner ends up throwing them away. The owner then decides to reduce the veggies to avoid waste. The customer gets upset, and the owner eventually gives in and serves more veggies again.\n\nSo, the key points here: the owner changed the order without consulting the customer. Normally, when a customer orders something, they expect to get what they ordered. Altering the dish without permission might be seen as violating that expectation. Even though the owner had a good reason (reducing waste), the customer didn't agree to the modification. \n\nThe owner did mention that the customer wasn't rude or nice, just left the veggies. So, maybe the owner could have approached it differently. Instead of changing the dish secretly, maybe they could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer veggies. That way, the customer's preference would be respected, and the owner's concern about waste would be addressed. \n\nBut by not discussing it and just changing the dish, the owner might have overstepped. The customer's reaction is understandable because they were expecting their usual meal. The owner's intention was good, but the method might have been wrong. \n\nAlso, the customer paid for the dish as usual, so they expect to receive the full dish. The owner's action could be seen as modifying the product without consent, which might be against standard customer service practices. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of food waste. The owner is trying to be responsible by not making unnecessary food. But there's a balance between business practices and customer expectations. \n\nIn summary, while the owner's intent was to reduce waste, changing the dish without asking the customer likely crossed a line. The correct approach would have been to communicate with the customer first. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong.\n"
