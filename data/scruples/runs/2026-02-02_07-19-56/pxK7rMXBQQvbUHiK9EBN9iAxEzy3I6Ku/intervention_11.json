I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a shop owner who sells Asian food. A regular customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables. The owner, frustrated by the waste, decides to give the customer less veggies next time. The customer gets angry, the owner explains, but then gives the customer the full veggies again. The owner is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The customer is paying for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. Even if they don't eat them, it's part of what they paid for. The owner tried to adjust the portion, which the customer didn't like. So, the owner changed back, but there's still waste.\n\nIs the owner in the wrong? Well, the customer expects to receive what they ordered. Changing the recipe without prior notice could be seen as altering the product. The owner might not have discussed this change with the customer first. However, the owner did try to accommodate the customer's usual preference but didn't check in. Maybe the customer expects the dish to be consistent. On the other hand, the owner is trying to prevent waste. But the proper approach might be to ask the customer if they want a modified version next time instead of assuming. The owner's action was maybe a bit abrupt. So, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the owner altered the dish without consulting the customer, leading to conflict. But the customer is also responsible for their order. However, the main issue is the owner changing the product without agreement. So A.\n"
