I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The shop owner, frustrated by the waste, decides to put fewer vegetables next time. The customer gets angry and makes a scene. The owner gives in and makes the dish with more veggies again, leading to waste.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to determine if the shop owner made a mistake here. \n\nOn one hand, the customer paid for the dish as ordered, so the owner might be altering the order without consent. Customers expect what they ordered. Changing the dish without prior discussion could be seen as not honoring the order, even if the customer usually leaves the veggies. \n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste. Maybe the customer didn't realize the impact or didn't mention their preference. The owner could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer veggies instead of just reducing them. Communicating first might have resolved the issue without conflict.\n\nBut the customer didn't ask for modifications either. So there's a mutual misunderstanding. However, the owner's action of altering the dish without discussion might be the error here. The customer has the right to expect their order as placed. The owner could address the waste by offering a different option or charging less if the customer prefers less veg, but changing the dish unilaterally might not be the right approach. \n\nSo the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the owner changed the order without consulting the customer. Even with good intentions, the customer's right to their ordered dish is important. The owner should have communicated first to adjust the order appropriately.\n"
