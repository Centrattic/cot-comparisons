I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the shop owner is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a regular customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables. The owner starts giving him less vegetables to avoid waste, but the customer gets angry. The owner then gives him the full amount again, leading to waste.\n\nFirst, the customer pays for the dish as ordered, which includes vegetables. Even if he doesn't eat them, he's paying for the full dish. By reducing the vegetables without the customer's consent, maybe the owner changed the product without agreement. That could be a problem because the customer expects what they ordered each time. \n\nBut on the other hand, the owner is trying to reduce food waste. That's a valid concern. However, the way they handled it might not be the best. Instead of just changing the dish without telling the customer, maybe they should have asked if they wanted to modify the order. The owner could have a policy for such cases, like offering a version without veggies for a slightly different price or asking if they want fewer veggies. \n\nThe customer's reaction was anger, which is a problem. The owner might not have considered that the customer has a reason for ordering the dish with veggies, even if they don't eat them. Maybe it's part of their diet, or they prefer the dish to look a certain way. Changing it without permission could be seen as disrespectful to the customer's choice.\n\nSo, the owner's action was well-intentioned to reduce waste, but the action itself was without the customer's consent. Therefore, the owner might be in the wrong because altering the product without the customer's agreement is part of the issue. The right approach would be communication to find a solution that respects both the customer's order and the owner's desire to minimize waste.\n"
