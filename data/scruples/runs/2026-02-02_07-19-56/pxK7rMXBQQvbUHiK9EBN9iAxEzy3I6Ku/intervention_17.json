I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving vegetables to a customer who doesn't eat them. The situation is that the customer orders the same dish every time but leaves the vegetables, leading to waste. The shop owner tried reducing the vegetables once, which made the customer angry, and then had to make it again with more veggies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. When someone orders a dish, they expect to receive it as it's normally prepared unless they specify modifications. The customer might feel that the dish is incomplete without the vegetables, even if they don't eat them. It could be part of their order's presentation or a habit. The shop owner changed the dish without the customer's consent, which could be seen as a breach of the standard order.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop owner is concerned about food waste. Vegetables that are prepared and not eaten are thrown away, which is a valid concern. However, the owner's approach was to unilaterally alter the dish, which might not be the best solution. A better approach might be to ask the customer if they want the vegetables omitted or if they prefer a different dish. Alternatively, offering a menu option without vegetables could be a proactive solution.\n\nThe key here is the assumption made by the shop owner. The owner assumed the customer didn't like the vegetables and adjusted the dish without communication. The customer might have a different reason for not eating them\u2014maybe they're on a diet, have allergies, or it's a personal choice. By not asking, the owner made a judgment that could be incorrect. The customer's reaction (making a scene) indicates that the dish wasn't as expected, leading to dissatisfaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the shop owner is responsible for fulfilling the customer's order as expected. If the customer wants a modification, they should request it. The owner can't assume that part of the dish should be altered unless the customer communicates that. The fact that the customer has been coming in regularly and hasn't mentioned the vegetables suggests that they expect the dish as it is. The owner's action of changing it without prior discussion is likely the issue here.\n\nSo, while the waste is a problem, the method of addressing it by altering the dish without consent is where the mistake lies. The shop owner should have communicated with the customer to find a solution, maybe by offering alternatives or discussing options. Therefore, the shop owner is in the wrong for not giving the vegetables without first consulting the customer.\n"
