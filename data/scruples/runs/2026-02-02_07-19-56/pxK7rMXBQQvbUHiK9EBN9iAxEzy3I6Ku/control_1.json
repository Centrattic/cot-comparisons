I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the shop owner is at fault for adjusting the amount of vegetables in a dish because a customer leaves them uneaten. So, the customer orders the same dish repeatedly but never eats the vegetables, leading the owner to modify the order. The customer then gets upset when the vegetables are reduced. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The customer pays for the dish as ordered each time, so the owner's initial mistake is assuming that the customer doesn't want the vegetables without explicitly stating that. The customer's right to get exactly what they ordered is important here. Even if the customer usually leaves the vegetables, the order is based on the standard recipe. Altering the order without prior communication can be seen as a breach of expectations.\n\nThe shop owner tried to be efficient by reducing waste but didn't communicate the change. The customer was upset because they expected the usual dish. The owner's action might be seen as overstepping because the customer didn't explicitly ask for modifications. However, the owner's intention was to prevent waste, which is a valid concern. \n\nLegally and ethically, restaurants are supposed to provide what the customer orders. If the customer wanted less vegetables, they should have asked. However, the shop owner modified the dish without the customer's consent, which can be considered the owner's fault. The correct approach would have been to ask the customer if they wanted the usual dish or a modified version to avoid waste. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the shop owner is in the wrong (A) because they altered the order without the customer's agreement. Even with good intentions, the customer's expectation was not met, leading to the conflict.\n"
