I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the shop owner is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a regular customer always orders the same dish but leaves the vegetables. The owner starts giving them less vegetables to avoid waste, but the customer gets upset. The owner then gives more vegetables again, leading to waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's perspective. When someone orders a dish, they expect to get what they paid for. The dish likely has vegetables as part of the recipe. If you remove a significant amount without consulting the customer, that could be seen as altering the dish, which they might not appreciate. Even if the customer doesn't eat the veggies, they might still expect the full dish. So maybe the owner overstepped by changing the order without asking.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste. That's a valid concern. Maybe the customer isn't aware that they can request fewer vegetables. If the owner had a policy or communicated that clearly, it might be different. But since the customer has never asked for modifications before, the owner's assumption might not be fair. The customer might not know they can ask for adjustments, or maybe they just don't like the veggies but still want the full dish. \n\nThe owner's approach was to unilaterally change the order, which led to the customer being upset. The owner's reasoning is that they want to prevent waste, but the method used could be problematic. The customer might feel disrespected or that their order wasn't fulfilled as expected. Even if the customer isn't eating the veggies, the order was for the full dish. The owner might have a point about waste, but the way it was handled was maybe not the best. \n\nAnother angle: standard practice in restaurants is to prepare dishes as ordered unless a modification is requested. So if the dish includes vegetables, the customer expects them. Altering the dish without prior notice could be seen as a breach of that expectation. The owner could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer veggies next time instead of just changing it. That would be more respectful and avoid the conflict. \n\nHowever, the owner's intention was good\u2014trying to reduce waste. But the execution might not have been right. The customer's right to get their ordered dish as prepared is important. So maybe the owner is in the wrong for changing the dish without discussing it with the customer first. \n\nSo overall, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they modified the order without communication, which led to the customer's dissatisfaction. The solution could be to have a conversation about the waste issue and offer options instead of making unilateral changes.\n"
