I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is trying to reduce food waste because a regular customer consistently leaves the vegetables from his dish. The customer ordered his usual, which includes vegetables he doesn't eat. The owner adjusted the order by adding fewer veggies, which made the customer upset. The owner then gave in and made the regular dish again, leading to waste.\n\nSo, the question is whether the owner was wrong for not giving the vegetables. The customer pays for the dish as ordered. But he doesn't eat the veggies each time. The owner tried to modify the order to prevent waste, which the customer didn't like. \n\nFrom a business perspective, customers typically expect what they order. However, maybe there was a way to address this without causing a scene. Did the owner communicate the change beforehand? Maybe the customer didn't know he could request modifications. Also, food waste is a valid concern. But altering the dish without prior discussion might have caused the issue. \n\nThe customer's reaction was anger, which suggests he expected the full dish each time. The owner's intent was good, but handling it differently might have been better. Perhaps offering a modified dish from the start if the customer requests it. Since the customer didn't mention the issue before, the owner might not be entirely at fault. Still, the approach of changing the dish without prior agreement could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all sides, the owner's action was well-intentioned but perhaps miscommunicated. The answer might lean towards the owner not being in the wrong because they were trying to reduce waste, but maybe they should have discussed it with the customer first. But the customer also didn't communicate his preferences. Hmm.\n"
