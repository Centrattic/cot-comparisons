I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the shop owner is in the wrong for adjusting the amount of vegetables in a customer's dish because the customer consistently leaves them uneaten.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The customer orders the same dish regularly, leaves the vegetables, and the owner is wasting food each time. The owner tried reducing the veggies once, leading to the customer getting angry. Then the owner reverted, still causing waste.\n\nThe main question is whether the owner's action of reducing the veggies was wrong. From a business perspective, customers typically expect to receive what they ordered unless there's a prior arrangement. Changing the order without discussing it might breach expectations. The owner did mention the issue, but not before altering the dish, which could be seen as a misstep.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is concerned about food waste, which is a valid environmental and economic issue. However, the approach might have been better addressed by communicating first. Maybe the owner could have asked the customer if they wanted fewer veggies next time instead of making the change unilaterally. The customer might not realize the extent of the waste or may have reasons for ordering the dish as is (e.g., dietary needs, family, etc.).\n\nAlso, the customer might have felt disrespected by the change without prior notice. The owner's intention was good to reduce waste, but the method could have been improved. The fact that the customer made a scene suggests that the adjustment was unexpected and unwelcome. In the end, the owner had to revert, leading back to waste.\n\nSo, while the owner's goal is understandable, the method of handling it might be where they went wrong. They should have probably discussed the change with the customer first. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the owner being in the wrong for not communicating, hence answer A. But wait, maybe not in the wrong, but just in a gray area. However, based on the standard answer here, if the action was taken without prior communication, the owner could be considered in the wrong. But sometimes, businesses do modify portions for waste reduction with regulars. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because the owner had a valid reason to reduce waste, but could have handled it better. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they changed the order without discussing, maybe A is correct. But some might argue it's not their fault since the customer didn't specify. I'm a bit torn. Let me check similar scenarios. In many cases, altering the order without the customer's consent can be seen as a breach of the transaction. So the answer is A.\n"
