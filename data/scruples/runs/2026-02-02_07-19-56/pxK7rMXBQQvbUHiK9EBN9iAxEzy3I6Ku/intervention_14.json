I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The shop owner is a local Asian food seller. A regular customer orders the same dish every time but doesn't eat the vegetables, leading to waste. The owner decides to reduce the veggies in the dish to minimize waste. The customer gets upset, and there's a scene. The owner then reverts to the usual amount, still resulting in waste.\n\nFirst, the customer isn't eating the veggies but pays for the full dish. The owner's action to adjust the portion is to prevent waste. But the customer expects consistency. The question is whether the owner was wrong to modify the order.\n\nFrom a business perspective, customers expect what they ordered. Altering the dish without prior agreement could be seen as not fulfilling the order as requested. Even if the customer isn't eating the veggies, the owner should have discussed the change first. Making unilateral decisions might breach the implicit contract of the transaction. However, the owner's intention is to reduce waste, which is commendable.\n\nThe customer might argue they paid for the full dish, so they should receive it as ordered. The owner's action, while well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping without prior communication. The key point is whether the owner should have communicated the change instead of implementing it without notice. The customer's reaction suggests they value consistency, and the owner's decision to adjust without asking might be the issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, the owner is trying to prevent waste. Maybe a better approach would be to ask the customer if they want fewer veggies or offer a different option. But since the author didn't do that, it's a communication breakdown. So, the owner's mistake was not discussing the change first. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the customer's expectation of receiving the ordered dish as usual, even if it leads to waste. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
