I have this customer coming in quite often already. He always orders the same dish, but every time he finished eating he always leave the vegetables untouched resulting in me throwing it away all the time. He pays normally and leave. So everything is neutral, he's not being nice or being rude either.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThen there was this one time, he came in again and orders his usual dish. But this time i decided, before we are wasting the vegetables again, I will cook less/very few vegetables for him. Then when I brought the food to his table he kinda got angry for having such less vegetables in his dish. I told him you never eat the vegetables so what's the point of cooking it? Then he made quite a scene about it. I didn't want things to get that heated so I calmed him down and cooked the same dish with more vegetables for him. And here I am again throwing away the vegetables.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI understand a customer should get what he orders but that's such a waste of food. If he doesn't like the vegetables why does he orders it in the first place? So AITA for not giving him vegetables?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the shop owner (the author) is in the wrong for reducing the vegetables in the customer's dish because the customer leaves them uneaten each time. \n\nFirst, the situation: The customer orders the same dish repeatedly, always leaves the vegetables, pays normally, and isn't rude or nice. Then, the shop owner decides to cook less vegetables, which upsets the customer. The owner explains the reasoning, but the customer makes a scene. The owner then gives more vegetables again, leading to waste.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're curious for the assistant's take. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Customers typically expect to receive what they ordered. Altering the order without prior agreement could be seen as changing the product, which might not be acceptable. Even if the customer isn't eating the veggies, the owner didn't consult them first. The owner has a valid point about food waste, but maybe they should have approached it differently, like discussing with the customer or offering alternatives (e.g., a side without veggies). \n\nHowever, the owner did try to adjust but faced pushback. The key issue is whether changing the order without consent is wrong. In most service scenarios, customers have the right to expect consistency unless there's a prior customization request. The author made an unilateral change, which led to conflict. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating first. But if the owner had offered a modified option and the customer agreed, that would be different. Since they didn't, the answer might lean towards A. But maybe B because the owner had a valid reason to prevent waste. Hmm, tricky. \n\nAnother angle: the customer is paying for the dish as ordered. The owner's action changes the product, which could be seen as not fulfilling the order. The owner's intention is good (reduce waste), but the method was flawed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate and altered the order without consent. Alternatively, maybe B if the owner had a right to adjust based on prior behavior. But usually, service providers can't unilaterally change the product. So probably A.\n"
