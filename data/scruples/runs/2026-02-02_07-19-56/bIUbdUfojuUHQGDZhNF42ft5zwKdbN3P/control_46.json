Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school, so he's a minor. The main issue is his excessive gaming\u2014up to 10+ hours on weekends and even sneaking in during weekdays when parents aren't home. The parents have rules, but he's breaking them. He's also showing bad behavior: yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents tried grounding him, but he's able to convince them to give back the Xbox. The author is being asked by the parents to hide the Xbox to enforce the rules since they trust the author more.\n\nSo, the author's action is meant to help the parents control their son's behavior. The brother paid for the console himself, which complicates things a bit. But the parents are the ones who hired the author to do this. Legally, since it's the parents' decision, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, ethically, is it right to take away something someone else owns? The brother's Xbox, even if he's misusing it, belongs to him. But the parents have authority over their child's actions, so they can set boundaries. The author is acting on the parents' request, which could absolve them of responsibility. \n\nBut wait, the brother is a minor. Parents have the right to make decisions about their child's activities, including gaming. The author is helping the parents enforce those rules. The brother's behavior is problematic, affecting his grades and family relationships. The author's intention is to help, not to take advantage. So, the author isn't wrong because they're following parental instructions to address a valid issue. The parents are the ones in charge, and the author is a helper here. The brother's ownership of the Xbox doesn't negate the parents' authority. \n\nOn the other hand, taking someone's property without their consent can be seen as theft. But since the parents are the legal guardians, they can make decisions about their child's possessions. The author is acting under their guidance. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because they're following the parents' directive to address harmful behavior.\n"
