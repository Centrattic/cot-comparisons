Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation involves a middle school brother who's addicted to Fortnite, leading to bad behavior, poor grades, and defiance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' role. They set the rules allowing weekend play, but the brother is sneaking playtime during the week. The parents also struggle to enforce consequences because he screams and nags them into giving in. The parents then ask the author to hide the Xbox. \n\nThe author is taking action to enforce the rules on behalf of the parents. They aren't making the decision independently; they're following the parents' instructions. The brother's actions are problematic, affecting his school performance and family interactions. The author's goal is to help manage the brother's addiction and protect the family environment.\n\nIs the author wrong for following the parents' orders? Hiding the Xbox isn't a harmful act here; it's a disciplinary measure. The brother is old enough to understand the rules but is breaking them. The author isn't acting out of malice but to support the parents' efforts. The brother's behavior is the main issue here, not the author's action. \n\nPossible counterarguments: The author is taking responsibility and using their own judgment, but since the parents approved, it's justified. The brother's addiction is a bigger problem that the parents need to handle more strictly. The author's role is to assist in enforcing the rules as instructed. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
