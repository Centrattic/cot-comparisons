Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation involves a middle-school brother who's addicted to Fortnite. He's playing way too much, even on weekdays when he's supposed to be grounded, and his behavior has become aggressive with yelling, swearing, and poor grades. The parents have rules but he breaks them, and when grounded, he pesters them until they give in. The parents then asked the author to hide the Xbox to enforce the rules.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's brother is clearly having issues with gaming addiction, which is affecting his behavior and school performance. The parents are trying to manage this but the brother is finding ways around their rules. The author is taking action as a sibling to help enforce the parents' wishes, even though it's a difficult situation.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents explicitly told them to do this. If the parents are the ones who instructed the author to hide the Xbox, then the author is acting under their authority. The brother's actions are problematic, so the author is trying to protect the family environment and the brother's well-being by complying with the parents' request. However, there's a line between helping and taking on a parental role. But in this case, since the parents are involved and it's their directive, the author is just following their orders. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a concern about the author taking on a disciplinarian role that's typically the parents' responsibility. However, given the context, the parents are relying on the author because they trust them. The brother's addiction is causing significant issues, so the action is meant to address a bigger problem. The author isn't acting out of spite but out of concern for their brother and family. \n\nI think the key points are that the parents are the ones who told the author to do this, and the situation is about protecting the brother from his harmful habits. So the author isn't the asshole here; they're part of the solution as per the parents' instruction. The real issue is the brother's addiction and the parents' struggle to manage it. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
