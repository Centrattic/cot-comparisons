Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox because of his Fortnite addiction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The brother is in middle school, and his Fortnite addiction is causing problems: he's playing over 10 hours on weekends, sneaking in weekday play, yelling at the family, using profanity, and his grades are slipping. The parents have rules but he breaks them. They asked the author to hide the Xbox. The author is conflicted but determined to do it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The parents are the ones who gave the author the task to hide the Xbox. If the parents are on board with this, then the author is following their directive. However, the brother paid for the console himself, which adds a layer. But the parents might still be the legal guardians, so they have authority over their child's behavior and belongings, even if the child bought it. \n\nThe key points here are that the author is acting under the parents' orders. The brother's addiction is affecting his behavior and academics, so there's a valid concern. The parents are trying to enforce discipline. The author is taking action to help manage the situation as instructed. \n\nBut wait, is there any wrongdoing? The author isn't forced to do this; they chose to comply. If the parents asked them to do it, then it's not the author's fault. The brother's issues are his own, and the author is trying to help. However, if the author is hiding the Xbox without the parents' knowledge, that might be different. But according to the post, the parents told the author to do it. \n\nAnother angle: the brother is paying for the console. Does that mean he owns it? If the parents allowed him to buy it, they might still have control over when and how he uses it. The author is following their parents' instructions, so it's not their responsibility. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author is taking it too far, but the situation seems extreme. The brother's behavior is problematic, and the parents are struggling to enforce rules. The author is supporting a necessary intervention. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting under parental authority to address a serious issue.\n"
