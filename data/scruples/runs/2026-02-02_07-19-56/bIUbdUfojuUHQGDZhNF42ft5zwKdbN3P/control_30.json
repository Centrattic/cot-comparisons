Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. The situation involves a middle schooler with a significant gaming addiction, poor behavior, and declining grades. The parents have rules but the brother is sneaking playtime. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014excessive gaming, disrespect, academic issues. The parents are struggling to enforce rules because the brother manipulates them into giving back the Xbox. The author, being trusted by the parents, takes action to hide the console. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Well, the parents explicitly told them to do it. The brother is the one violating the rules, and the author's actions are meant to enforce the parents' wishes. The brother paid for the Xbox, but the parents might have given him the console, so the ownership isn't entirely his. Also, the author's intention is to protect the family from the brother's negative behavior, which seems like a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overstepping, but since the parents approved the action, it's more about supporting the parents' authority. The brother's addiction and behavior are the real issues here. The author's actions are a form of intervention. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the parents' instructions and trying to help address a bigger problem.\n"
