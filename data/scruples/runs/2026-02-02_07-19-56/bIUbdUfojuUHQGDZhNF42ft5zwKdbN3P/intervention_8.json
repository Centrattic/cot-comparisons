Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation is that the brother is a middle schooler with a Fortnite addiction, playing over 10 hours on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has deteriorated, he's yelling, using profanity, and his grades are slipping. The parents tried grounding him, but he gets them to cave in. The author was told to hide the Xbox without telling the parents.\n\nSo the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want opinions. I need to decide if A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong) is the correct answer. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the parents are the authority here. They set the rules about game time and grounding. The author is a sibling, not a parent, so stepping in to enforce parental decisions by hiding the Xbox might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. But the parents asked them to do it. Wait, the parents told the author to hide the Xbox and not tell them. Hiding it without the parents' knowledge could be problematic. Even if the parents asked, if the author is hiding it without the parents knowing, that's a bit of a contradiction. The parents would need to be involved to make the grounding effective, but the author is acting as an enforcer.\n\nThe brother is paying for the console, so taking it away might be an issue. But the parents are the ones who set the rules, so maybe the money aspect is less relevant here. The author's intention is to prevent the brother from getting it back, which the parents failed to do. The brother's addiction is causing bad behavior and affecting his grades. The author is trying to help, but is it right for them to take such a step without the parents' direct involvement? \n\nAlso, hiding the Xbox could lead to other issues. The brother might get angry, maybe look for the console, and the author could be blamed. The parents might not have considered all consequences, and the author's action might be seen as overstepping. On the other hand, the brother is being unreasonable, and the author is trying to protect the family's well-being. But the author isn't the parent, so maybe they shouldn't be enforcing such a strict measure. \n\nAnother angle: if the parents are the ones who told the author to hide it, then perhaps it's their plan to avoid the brother from finding it. However, the fact that the author is hiding the Xbox without the parents actually being told where it's hidden could be an issue. The parents might still want to handle the grounding in a different way. The author is acting as an enforcer, which could create tension. \n\nAlso, considering the brother's age, middle school is a time when peer influence and screen time can be significant. The author is trying to help, but the method might be problematic. Maybe the parents should be the ones to take action, not the sibling. The author might be doing it for a good reason, but the action could be seen as taking sides or not allowing the parents to manage their child's behavior properly. \n\nIn some cases, siblings stepping in to enforce rules can help, but it's important to do so in a way that's constructive and doesn't create further conflict. Hiding the Xbox might work, but the author could be in the wrong because they're not the ones in charge. The parents might prefer to handle it themselves, especially since the brother is paying for the console. The author's role here is a bit of a middleman, which isn't their place. \n\nBut the parents specifically asked the author to do this. If that's the case, maybe the parents are the ones who think this is necessary, and the author is just following their lead. However, the problem is that the author is hiding the Xbox and not telling the parents. Wait, the parents told the author to hide it without telling them. So the author is supposed to know where it's hidden, but the parents don't? That might not be a good plan because if the parents need to access it, they can't. The author might be making a decision that affects the parents' ability to manage the situation. \n\nSo overall, even if the intention is good, the method might be wrong. The author is taking a unilateral action without the parents' direct control. The parents are the ones who should be handling the consequences of the brother's actions. The author might be trying to help, but it's not their responsibility to enforce rules in such a way. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
