Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother is in middle school, spending 10+ hours a day on Fortnite, even on weekdays when parents aren't home. His behavior has worsened, with yelling, profanity, and poor grades. Parents have tried grounding him, but he manipulates them into giving the Xbox back. The author hid the Xbox to stop this, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're trying to help by preventing the brother's harmful behavior. But is this justified? Let's consider the ethical angles.\n\nOn one hand, the brother's actions are problematic\u2014excessive gaming, bad behavior, academic issues. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, and the author is stepping in to enforce them. The parents even told the author to hide the Xbox, so there's some level of parental support here. The author's intent is to help the brother, not just themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother owns the Xbox. Hiding it without permission might infringe on his property rights. But since the parents gave the author permission, maybe that mitigates the wrong. Also, the brother's actions are affecting the whole family, so the author might feel justified in protecting the household environment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent, consequences, and whether the action was the best approach. The author's intent is to help, and the parents are on board. The brother's behavior is clearly negative, so the action is a response to a problematic situation. Even though the brother owns the Xbox, the parents' consent might make it okay.\n\nBut some might argue that the author shouldn't take matters into their own hands, even if the parents asked. However, given the context, the author is acting as a helper in a situation where the parents are struggling. The key points are the brother's harmful behavior and parental approval.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they're following parental instructions to address a harmful addiction, even if it involves the brother's property.\n"
