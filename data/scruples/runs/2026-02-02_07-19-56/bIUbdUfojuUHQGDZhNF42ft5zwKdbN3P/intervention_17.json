Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. The author's brother is in middle school and has become addicted, sneaking playtime and causing behavioral issues. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both perspectives. The brother's addiction is causing problems\u2014bad grades, yelling, and swearing. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, and the author is stepping in to help. But is hiding the Xbox the right approach? \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to protect their brother from self-harm and a toxic environment. The parents might not be handling the situation effectively, so the author is taking matters into their own hands. On the other hand, hiding someone else's property could be seen as theft or interference. However, since the parents authorized the action, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' role and the author's intent. The parents are at fault for enabling the addiction by giving in to the brother's tantrums. The author is acting in what they believe to be the best interest, especially since their brother's behavior is deteriorating. But is the method appropriate? Hiding the Xbox might be a necessary evil given the circumstances. \n\nI remember similar AITA scenarios where siblings take action to protect each other from harmful behavior. The line between helping and interfering can be blurry. Since the parents are the ones who asked the author to do this, it might not be the author's fault. However, the brother didn't consent to his Xbox being hidden. But given the context of parental involvement and the negative consequences of the addiction, the author's actions might be justified. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no ethical issue with taking someone else's property, even with parental consent. If the parents gave permission, maybe it's okay. Alternatively, the author could be complicit in parental decision-making, but the brother's well-being is at stake. I think the author's intentions are good, so they might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
