Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. So the situation is that the brother has a Fortnite addiction, playing way too much, even sneaking in weekdays. His behavior is getting worse\u2014yelling, using profanity, bad grades. The parents are struggling because when they ground him, he nags them until they give in. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for doing that? Answer A or B. Let me break this down. The author's actions are meant to help control their brother's addiction and prevent bad behavior. The parents are involved; they asked the author to do this. The brother is in middle school, so he's a minor. The author is following the parents' instructions. \n\nBut wait, is there an issue with the author taking matters into their own hands? The brother bought the console himself, but the parents are the ones who gave the order. The author's intent is to protect their family's well-being. However, some might argue that the author could be overstepping, but since the parents approved, maybe not. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should let the parents handle it without interfering. But given that the parents are struggling and the author is acting as a helper, perhaps it's justified. The brother's behavior is harmful, so hiding the Xbox is a way to enforce boundaries. The author isn't taking it away permanently, just hiding it until the parents can manage it. \n\nI think the key points are the parents' consent and the brother's problematic behavior. Since the parents are involved and the author is trying to help, the answer is likely B. But maybe some would say the author shouldn't meddle. However, the parents asked them to do it, so it's not entirely the author's decision. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
