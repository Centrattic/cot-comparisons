Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The brother is a middle schooler, and his Fortnite addiction is causing problems: excessive playtime, disrespect towards family, poor grades, and defiance when grounded. The parents are struggling because the brother sneaks playtime and even yells. They've asked the author to hide the Xbox to enforce the rules.\n\nThe author is taking action to prevent the brother from playing, even though the brother owns the console. The author's motivation is to protect their family from the brother's negative behavior and to help him break the addiction. The parents are complicit in this plan by asking the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, taking someone else's property without their consent could be seen as wrong. However, the context is that the brother is a minor, and the parents are the ones who've tasked the author with this action. The author's actions are to enforce parental rules and protect the household from the brother's harmful behavior.\n\nThe key points here are the age of the brother, the parents' involvement, and the intent behind the action. Since the parents approved the action and the brother is a minor, the author's actions are more about protecting the family dynamic rather than personal gain. The brother's behavior is clearly problematic, and the author is trying to help, even if it's through a strict method.\n\nSo, while taking someone's property isn't typically acceptable, in this context, the author is acting under parental authority to address a serious issue. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong).\n"
