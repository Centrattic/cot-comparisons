Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother is addicted to Fortnite, playing way too much, leading to bad grades and bad behavior. The parents are aware and have set rules, but the brother breaks them. The parents then tell the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's addiction is affecting his school performance and his interactions with family. The parents are trying to manage it but are struggling because the brother is sneaking playtime and acting out when grounded. The author is acting on the parents' instructions. So, the parents are directly asking the author to hide the Xbox, which is a method to enforce the rules the brother isn't following.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are the authority figures here. If they've given the author a directive, even if it's a bit of a harsh measure, the author is following their orders. The brother's actions are the main issue. The author's intent is to help their parents manage the addiction, which is a legitimate concern. However, hiding the Xbox could be seen as a form of punishment or a way to enforce rules, but since it's the parents' decision, the author isn't acting independently. The brother's behavior is problematic, so the author's action is a response to that. But is hiding the Xbox morally wrong? Maybe not, especially if the parents are on board. The key point is that the parents are the ones making the decision, and the author is just carrying it out. The author's role is to support the parents in managing the brother's addiction. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're following parental instructions to address a real problem.\n"
