Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother is in middle school and has become addicted to Fortnite, playing over 10 hours on weekends and even sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014he's yelling, using profanity, and his grades have dropped. The parents have rules but he breaks them. The parents asked the author (probably a sibling) to hide the Xbox to enforce the rules.\n\nThe author is conflicted but determined to do it regardless. They argue that the brother paid for the console but that the author is still acting out of concern. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nNow, evaluating: The parents are the ones who asked the author to hide the Xbox. If the parents gave explicit instructions, the author is following their orders. The brother's actions are problematic, and the author is trying to help. The author isn't taking the Xbox permanently but is hiding it to enforce rules. The brother's behavior is negative, so the author's actions are a response to protect the family environment. The parents are involved, so the author isn't acting independently against the parents' wishes. The key point is whether the author overstepped by not informing the parents, but since the parents told them to do it, maybe they're in the right. However, if the parents didn't explicitly ask, then it's different. The post says the parents told the author to hide it, so they're acting on parents' behalf. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
