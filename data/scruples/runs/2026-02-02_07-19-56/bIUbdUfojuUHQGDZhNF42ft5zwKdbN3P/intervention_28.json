Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother is a middle schooler who's spending way too much time on Fortnite, even sneaking playtime on weekdays. He's acting out, yelling, using profanity, and his grades are slipping. The parents have rules but are struggling to enforce them because the brother nags them. The author (the sibling) is hiding the Xbox to help, as the parents asked them to. The author feels justified because they want to help, even though the brother bought the console himself.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A or B.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is trying to help a sibling with a serious problem. The brother's behavior is concerning, and the parents are overwhelmed. The author might be acting out of a sense of responsibility. But on the other hand, hiding someone's property without their consent could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The brother has a right to his Xbox, even if he's misusing it. The parents are supposed to handle discipline, not a sibling. Also, the author might be overstepping by taking such a drastic action, even if it's with the parents' blessing. \n\nBut wait, the parents did ask the author to do this. So maybe it's part of their strategy. However, the brother didn't agree to this. The author is still removing his property, which could be stressful for the brother and might lead to more conflict. There's also the question of whether the parents are handling it correctly. Maybe the parents should be stricter, but the author is trying to help. \n\nI think the key points are: the brother's addiction and behavioral issues, the parents' ineffective response, and the author's role as an enforcer. The author's actions might be well-intentioned but could be seen as violating trust or taking control beyond their role. The brother's rights and privacy might be at stake here. Even with the parents' permission, the author is still involved in a situation that's the parents' responsibility. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because they're helping with a legitimate problem and under the parents' direction. But others might argue that it's not their place. \n\nAlternatively, considering the brother's age and the severity of the addiction, the author's actions are protective. However, there's a line between helping and interfering. The answer might depend on cultural views too. In some contexts, siblings helping parents manage discipline is normal. In others, it's seen as taking sides. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to help a family member with a serious issue and are following the parents' instructions. The main problem is the brother's addiction, not the author's action. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
