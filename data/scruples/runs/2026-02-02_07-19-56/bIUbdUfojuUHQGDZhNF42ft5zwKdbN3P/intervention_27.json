Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author hid their brother's Xbox because the brother is addicted to Fortnite. The brother is in middle school, playing 10+ hours on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has gotten worse\u2014he yells, uses profanity, his grades are below average. When grounded, he screams and nagging makes parents give in. Parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nSo, the author is taking action without telling the parents. The brother owns the console, but the parents gave the author permission to hide it. The author is doing this to help with the brother's addiction and bad behavior.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is trying to protect their family from the brother's negative behavior. The parents might be struggling to enforce rules, and the author is stepping in. But is it the author's place to do that? The brother owns the Xbox, so maybe there's an issue with respecting his property. Also, hiding something without permission could lead to conflict or mistrust. But the parents did ask the author to hide it, which complicates things. The parent's permission might make it okay. But the author is taking a role that's not traditionally theirs. Maybe the parents should handle it themselves? However, the brother's actions are affecting the whole family, so the author's intervention could be justified. It's a tough call. The key factors are the parents' approval and the impact of the brother's behavior. Since the parents are involved and the author is acting to mitigate harmful behavior, maybe it's not wrong. But some might argue that the author shouldn't take matters into their own hands even if the parents want it. But since the parents explicitly told them to do it, maybe it's okay. So I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
