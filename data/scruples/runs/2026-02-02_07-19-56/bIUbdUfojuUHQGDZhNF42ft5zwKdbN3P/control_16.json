Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to Fortnite addiction. The context is that the brother is in middle school, plays excessive Fortnite, which has led to bad behavior, poor grades, and the parents are struggling to control it. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The brother's addiction is causing problems: yelling, profanity, bad grades. The parents have rules but the brother breaks them. The author is following the parents' instructions to hide the Xbox. The author is doing this to help manage the brother's behavior, even though the brother bought the console himself. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, the parents are the ones who asked the author to do this. They're trying to enforce discipline. The author is acting as an enforcer of their parents' rules. The brother's actions are problematic, so the author's intention is to help the brother and the family. However, the brother bought the Xbox, so maybe there's an issue with taking something he owns. But since the parents are involved, maybe they have authority over it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the parents' orders to protect the brother's well-being. The parents are the ones making the decision, and the author is supporting that. The brother's addiction is affecting the whole family, so the action is in the interest of the family's health. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
