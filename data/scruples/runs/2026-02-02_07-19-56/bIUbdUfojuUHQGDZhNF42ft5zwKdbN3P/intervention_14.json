Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother is in middle school and has a significant addiction to Fortnite, playing over 10 hours on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents have rules but he breaks them, and when grounded, he nagges them into giving in. The parents then ask the narrator (the author) to hide the Xbox without telling them where, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nSo, the author is taking a stand against their brother's harmful behavior. They're trying to help by removing access to the game. But is this the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the brother's actions are problematic. The author is trying to protect their family from the negative consequences. By hiding the Xbox, they might be helping to enforce the parents' rules more effectively since the brother can't get it back. The parents trusted them to do this, so it's a form of support.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother owns the Xbox. Hiding it without his knowledge could be seen as a privacy violation. Even if the intention is good, the method involves deception. The brother might feel betrayed, and it could damage the sibling relationship. Also, the author is taking matters into their own hands instead of letting the parents handle the discipline. The parents might have their own way of dealing with the situation once they find out the Xbox is hidden.\n\nAnother angle: the author's role. They're a sibling, not a parent. It's the parents' responsibility to manage their child's behavior. By stepping in, the author might be overstepping, even if well-intentioned. However, the parents did ask them to do it, so maybe they're following orders. But does that make it right? The brother is still a child, so the parents should be the ones to set boundaries.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to hide something someone else owns? If the brother is a minor, the parents have authority over his belongings. The author is acting on the parents' behalf, so maybe it's justified. But if the brother is paying for the console, then is it his property? Depending on local laws, minors' property rights might not be fully recognized, so the parents have control.\n\nAlso, considering the brother's behavior\u2014using profanity, yelling\u2014there's a safety angle. The author might be trying to prevent further negative behavior. However, the method (hiding the Xbox) might not address the root issues, like communication or professional help for addiction. But the author is a sibling trying their best.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are driven by concern for their brother and family. While the method involves deception and potential overstepping, the intent is positive. The parents' involvement complicates things, as they delegated the task to the author. However, the brother's ownership of the Xbox raises questions about privacy and autonomy. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the means justify the ends. If the parents approved, maybe it's not entirely their fault. But acting without considering the brother's perspective or seeking professional help could be a downside.\n\nI think the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because they're following parents' instructions and trying to help, even if their brother is a minor with problematic behavior. However, there are arguments for the author being in the wrong (A) due to the method used. But given the context of parental involvement and the severity of the brother's issues, maybe the answer is B.\n"
