Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school and has a Fortnite addiction, playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has gotten worse\u2014yelling, using profanity, and his grades are below average. The parents have rules allowing weekend play but he breaks them. When grounded, he nags until they give in. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nThe author is conflicted but thinks they might be the asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B).\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is following the parents' orders to hide the Xbox, which might be seen as helping enforce family rules. The brother's actions are problematic, so interfering could be for his own good. But the author is taking a direct action that affects the brother's property. Even if the parents asked, does the author have the right to do this? The brother owns the console, so hiding it without his consent could be an issue. However, since the parents are the ones who gave the order, maybe it's justified under their authority.\n\nBut is the author overstepping? The parents could handle it themselves. By taking action, the author is taking responsibility for enforcing the rules, which the parents might not consistently do. But is it the author's responsibility to step in like that? Maybe the parents should be addressing their own child's behavior instead of delegating it to a sibling. The author might be in the wrong by becoming a pawn in the parents' disciplinary strategy, which could lead to family conflict and resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, if the brother's behavior is harmful, and the parents are struggling to enforce rules, the author's action might be seen as necessary. The key points are the parents' role and whether the author should intervene. If the parents are the ones who asked, perhaps the author isn't at fault. But the brother's ownership of the Xbox adds complexity. The author might be infringing on the brother's property rights, but under parental authority, maybe that's acceptable.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author was acting under parental authority or taking matters into their own hands. Since the parents gave the order, it's more about enforcing family rules. The author isn't directly responsible for the brother's actions but is trying to help. However, maybe the parents should handle it themselves, and the author shouldn't be the one to implement such a strict measure. The brother's reaction (screaming, nagging) suggests the parents aren't consistent, and the author stepping in might be seen as overstepping. So, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they're not the parent and shouldn't be enforcing parental rules in this way. But if the parents are delegating, perhaps not. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. I'm leaning towards A, but not entirely sure.\n"
