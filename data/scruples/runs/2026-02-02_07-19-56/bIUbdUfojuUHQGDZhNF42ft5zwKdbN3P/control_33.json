Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The brother is in middle school, spends 10+ hours a day on the game, even on weekdays, which is against the parents' rules. The parents have tried grounding him, but he yells and they cave. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The parents are the ones who authorized the author to hide the Xbox. The brother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014poor grades, yelling, using profanity, and manipulating the parents. The author isn't acting on their own but following the parents' instructions. \n\nHiding the Xbox could be seen as a necessary measure to enforce the parents' rules. The brother is paying for the console, but the parents are the ones managing it. The author is just helping to enforce the rules set by the parents. The brother's actions are leading to negative consequences, and the parents are trying to intervene. The author isn't the one setting the rules but complying with them. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author is taking away something that's the brother's property. But since the parents are the ones who told the author to do it, it's within their authority. The brother's addiction is a family issue, and the author is acting as a helper here. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the parents' wishes to help manage their brother's problematic behavior. The main issue is the brother's addiction and the parents' struggle to control it. The author's actions are in line with the parents' instructions, so the answer is B.\n"
