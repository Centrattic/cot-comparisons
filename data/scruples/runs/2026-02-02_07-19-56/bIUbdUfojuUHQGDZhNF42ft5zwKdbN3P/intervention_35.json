Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox because he's addicted to Fortnite. The brother is in middle school and is playing way too much, even on weekdays, leading to bad behavior and poor grades. The parents' rules are being broken, and they've asked the author to hide the Xbox. The author is conflicted but willing to do it anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are the authority figures, and they've tasked their child (the author) with hiding the Xbox. So technically, the author is following their parents' orders. But is that the right approach? Hiding someone's property without their consent could be seen as taking matters into one's own hands, even if it's to help a sibling.\n\nThe brother's behavior is concerning: yelling, using profanity, and academic decline. The author's motivation is to help their brother by reducing his addiction, but the method of hiding the Xbox might not be the best. However, the parents are involved, and they've instructed the author to do this. The key here is whether the author is overstepping their role as a sibling. Even if the parents asked, is the author responsible for enforcing such a restriction on their brother's belongings?\n\nAlso, the brother paid for the Xbox. If the author hides it, is that interfering with his property? But since it's in the family home and the parents are involved, maybe the parents have the authority to manage the Xbox. The author acting on their behalf might be acceptable.\n\nBut from a sibling relationship perspective, is this action creating resentment? The brother might feel betrayed, and the author could be seen as a tattletale. However, the author is trying to help, even if the method is harsh. The parents might appreciate the help, but the brother certainly won't.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is following their parents' instructions, which might mean they're not in the wrong. However, the act of hiding the Xbox could be seen as taking control away from the brother without addressing the root issues, like communication or parental enforcement. If the parents are already struggling to enforce rules, maybe the author's action is just a temporary fix but not the right approach.\n\nBut since the parents asked the author to do this, and the brother's behavior is problematic, the author might be justified in their actions. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that the author should let the parents handle it. However, since the parents are the ones who gave the order, the author is just complying. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
