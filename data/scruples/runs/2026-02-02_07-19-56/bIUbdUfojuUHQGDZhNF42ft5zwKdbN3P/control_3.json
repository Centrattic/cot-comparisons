Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. \n\nFirst, the situation: the brother is in middle school, spending excessive time on Fortnite, violating parental rules, and his behavior has deteriorated. The parents have asked the author to hide the Xbox as a solution. The author is considering if they're being an \"asshole\" by doing this, but still plans to do it.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's problematic gaming habits, the parents' attempt to manage it by involving the author, and the author's role in enforcing this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the parents are the ones responsible for their children's well-being. They've given the author specific instructions, so the author is acting under their authority. The brother's behavior is clearly harmful\u2014grades are slipping, he's disrespectful, and his outbursts are affecting the family. Even though the brother bought the Xbox himself, the parents are managing the access, and the author is following their lead. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's role. Is it appropriate for a sibling to be a disciplinarian? It might create tension between the siblings. However, since the parents are instructing the author, it's part of their strategy to address the issue. The author's intention is to help, not to be cruel. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is interfering with their brother's property without his consent. But since the parents have given permission and the Xbox is in their home, the parents have the right to control access. The author is merely following that directive. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't acting out of malice but concern. The parents are the primary authority here, and the author is assisting them. Therefore, the answer is likely B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
