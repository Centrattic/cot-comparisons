Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves hiding their brother's Xbox because he's addicted to Fortnite. The brother is in middle school, spending 10+ hours on the weekend, sneaking playtime on weekdays, using profanity, and his grades have dropped. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, and they told the author to hide the console. The author is conflicted but insists they're doing it to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The parents gave them permission to hide the Xbox, so maybe that's not the issue. The brother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014using profanity, yelling, poor grades. The parents are trying to control it but the brother resists. The author is following the parents' instructions, so maybe that's not wrong. However, hiding the Xbox could lead to other issues. Is the author overstepping? The brother owns the console, so taking it without his knowledge might be seen as violating trust. But since the parents asked for it, maybe it's justified. Also, the author's intent is to help their brother, even if the method is extreme. On the other hand, the brother's addiction is a broader issue that might need professional help. So the author's actions are part of a larger problem, but are they personally in the wrong? Since they're acting under parental guidance, maybe not. But the act of hiding it could escalate tensions. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're following the parents' orders and trying to protect their brother from negative consequences. The real issue is the parents' approach and the brother's behavior. So the answer would be B.\n"
