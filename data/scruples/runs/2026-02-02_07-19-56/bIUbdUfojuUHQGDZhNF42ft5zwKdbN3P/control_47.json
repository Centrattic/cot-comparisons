Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox because he's addicted to Fortnite. The brother is in middle school and has been playing a lot, even sneaking in weekday play. The parents have set rules, but the brother breaks them. The author's parents asked them to hide the Xbox to stop the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' role. They are the ones responsible for setting boundaries and managing their child's behavior. If they've already tried grounding him but he keeps breaking the rules, maybe they need a different approach. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox, so technically, the author is following their instructions. But is that the right thing to do?\n\nThe brother's behavior is concerning: yelling, using profanity, poor grades. These are signs of a bigger issue, possibly related to the addiction. The author is trying to help out by following their parents' request. But hiding the Xbox could be seen as taking control away from the brother, which might not be the best solution. Maybe the parents should involve the brother in setting rules or seek other interventions, like talking to a counselor or finding alternative activities. \n\nHowever, the author isn't the one setting the rules here. The parents are. The author is just implementing their decision. If the parents are at their wit's end and have asked for this action, the author might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, hiding the Xbox that the brother paid for without his knowledge could be seen as undermining him, especially if the parents aren't being consistent with their rules. But given the context, the author's intention is to help their parents manage their brother's addiction, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are the ones making the decision, and the author is acting on their behalf to address a problematic situation. The real issue might be the parents' approach to discipline and the brother's addiction, but the author's actions are a response to that.\n"
