Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is hiding their brother's Xbox because the brother is addicted to Fortnite. The brother is in middle school, and he's playing way too much, even sneaking in on weekdays. He's acting out, yelling, using profanity, and his grades are dropping. The parents are struggling to control him, and they told the author to hide the Xbox. The author is doing this even though the brother paid for the console.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is taking action against their brother's addiction, which is causing problems for the whole family. The parents have asked them to do this, so maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But on the other hand, the brother owns the console, so hiding it without his consent might be an issue. Is it right for a sibling to hide another's property, even if it's for a good reason?\n\nThe parents are the ones who set the rules, and they've given the author permission to hide the Xbox. That might absolve the author from direct blame. However, the brother is a minor, so the parents have responsibility. The author is acting as a proxy for the parents' wishes, even if it's a bit extreme. The main issue is the brother's addiction and behavior, which the parents are trying to manage. The author's actions are a form of intervention, albeit without the brother's consent. But since the parents are involved, maybe it's justified. The brother's well-being is the main concern here. The author might be doing what's necessary to help their brother, even if it's harsh. But is it their place to do so? Hiding someone's property, even a sibling, can be seen as overstepping. But given the context and parental approval, maybe it's acceptable. So, is it wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but since the parents are on board, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
