Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The author mentions their brother is in middle school and has been spending excessive time on Fortnite, leading to bad behavior and poor grades. The parents have rules about weekend play only, but the brother sneaks in weekday play. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox to enforce this, even though the brother paid for the console.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are the authority figures, and they've entrusted the author to help enforce their rules. The author is following the parents' instructions, so maybe that's not the issue. The brother is acting out, which is causing problems at home. The author's intention is to protect the family from the brother's negative behavior by limiting his access to Fortnite.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the Xbox was bought by the brother, so hiding it without his knowledge could be seen as taking his property without permission. However, the parents are the legal guardians, and they have the responsibility to manage their children's behavior. If the parents have given the author permission to do this, then it's part of their role in enforcing family rules.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might be effective, but could there be better ways to handle the situation? For example, involving the parents directly each time, or finding alternative ways to distract the brother. But the parents have already tried grounding him, and he resists. The author is stepping in to support the parents' wishes, which might be necessary given the brother's resistance.\n\nAlso, the brother's behavior is concerning\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The author's actions are aimed at mitigating these issues. While it's a bit underhanded, maybe the parents are using the author as an enforcer, which could have its own issues. However, the primary responsibility lies with the parents to manage their child's behavior, and the author is following their lead.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're acting under the parents' instructions to enforce rules that are in the family's best interest. The real issue might be the parents' approach, but the author is not the one making the rules here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
