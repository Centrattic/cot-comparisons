Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to control his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, the brother is a middle schooler with a severe addiction to Fortnite. He's spending way too much time playing, even breaking rules by playing on weekdays. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents are struggling to manage him; when they ground him, he yells and they give in. The parents told the author (the sibling) to hide the Xbox. The author is doing this despite the brother buying the console.\n\nNow, considering the parents' role. Normally, parents are supposed to manage their children's behavior. The fact that they asked the author to hide the Xbox suggests they feel they can't control the situation themselves. The author is following their parents' orders, which might mitigate their responsibility. However, the author is still acting on behalf of the parents, so maybe they're not entirely in the wrong.\n\nBut there's a question about whether the author has the right to do this. The brother paid for the Xbox, but if the parents gave the author permission to hide it, then it's within their authority. The author's intent is to help the brother, but is hiding the Xbox an appropriate method? It might be effective, but could also lead to resentment. However, given the brother's actions\u2014neglecting school, bad behavior\u2014it's a protective measure.\n\nAnother angle: the author isn't a parent, so stepping into a parental role might be overstepping. However, the parents are delegating responsibility here. If hiding the Xbox is within the scope of what the parents asked, then the author isn't at fault. The brother's actions are problematic, so the author's intervention is a response to a bigger issue.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to prevent harm to the brother (from addiction) and protect their family environment. While the method might be harsh, the intent is good. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
