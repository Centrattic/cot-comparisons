Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother is in middle school and has become addicted to Fortnite, playing 10+ hours on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has deteriorated: yelling, using profanity, poor grades. Parents tried grounding him, but he nags them into giving it back. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox without telling them.\n\nSo the author is following the parents' orders. The question is whether hiding the Xbox makes the author the asshole. \n\nI need to consider factors like age, parental authority, the brother's actions, and the author's role. The brother's addiction is causing negative effects. Parents are trying to intervene but are ineffective. The author is acting as an enforcer here. \n\nPossible arguments for A (author is wrong): Maybe taking away the Xbox isn't the author's responsibility. Or, maybe the author is being too harsh. But the parents are the ones who told them to do it. \n\nArguments for B (not wrong): The brother is acting out, parents are struggling, author is helping to enforce rules. The author is protecting the brother's well-being by reducing his addiction. The brother is old enough to have the Xbox but is misusing it. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the brother paid for the console. But the parents own the house and set the rules. Even if he paid for it, the family environment matters. \n\nI think the key here is that the parents authorized the action. The author isn't acting on their own but following instructions. The brother's behavior is problematic, and the parents are trying to help. So the author isn't in the wrong because they're supporting the parents' authority. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
