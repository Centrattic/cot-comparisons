Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The brother is in middle school, which is around 12-14 years old. He's playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaking in playtime on weekdays. His behavior is deteriorating: yelling, using profanity, poor grades. Parents have rules but he's breaking them, and when grounded, he's aggressive until they give in. The parents asked the author (the sibling) to hide the Xbox.\n\nThe author's actions: hiding the Xbox. The parents authorized this. The brother owns the console but the parents are using their child to enforce discipline. The author is doing what the parents asked, but the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nPossible angles: \n- The author is acting on parental orders, so they're following directions. The parents might not be able to enforce the rules themselves, so they're enlisting their other child. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're complying with authority.\n- However, hiding someone's property without consent could be seen as a problem. But since the parents own the house and the console is in their home, maybe the parents have control over it, even if the brother bought it. Also, the brother's behavior is harmful, so the action is for his well-being.\n\nBut there's a gray area. The author is taking a side in a family conflict. Even if the parents asked, is it right for a sibling to take such actions? It might affect the sibling relationship. Also, maybe the parents should handle it themselves without involving another child. But given the context that the parents are struggling and the author is a mediator, maybe it's justified.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong: The brother's excessive gaming is causing issues, and the parents are trying to intervene. The author is helping, so they might not be in the wrong. However, some might argue that it's unfair to the sibling being asked to enforce this, but the question is about the author's actions in hiding the Xbox. Since the parents are the ones who requested it, and the goal is to protect the brother from harmful behavior, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But maybe there's a better way, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution.\n"
