Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The author's main argument is that their brother is spending too much time on the game, leading to bad behavior, poor grades, and arguments. The parents told them to hide the Xbox, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the context. The brother is in middle school, which is around 11-14 years old. The parents have set rules about weekend play, but the brother is sneaking in extra time during the week. He's also exhibiting problematic behavior like yelling and using profanity. The grades have dropped since Fortnite, which is a red flag. The parents are struggling to enforce the rules because the brother can be aggressive when grounded, and they've asked the author to hide the Xbox. The author is doing this even though the brother bought the console himself, which might complicate things.\n\nNow, the question is whether hiding the Xbox is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author's intention is to protect their brother from harmful addiction and to help their parents enforce rules. The parents explicitly told them to do it, which could be seen as giving permission. So from the parents' perspective, it's a way to manage the situation. The author isn't taking sides; they're trying to maintain family harmony and stop the negative effects of the addiction.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother owns the Xbox, so hiding it without his knowledge could be seen as taking away his property without consent. However, since the parents are in charge of managing their children's behavior, they might have authority over how the Xbox is used, even if it's the child's property. The line here is whether the parents' authority extends to allowing a sibling to hide the console. Since they told the author to do it, maybe that's a gray area.\n\nAnother angle: the author is intervening to prevent harm. The brother's addiction is affecting his grades, behavior, and family interactions. The author is acting in what they believe is the family's best interest. However, using deception or taking away someone's belongings without consent can have negative consequences, even if the intent is good. The brother might feel betrayed, leading to more conflict. Also, the author is taking on a parental role, which might not be their responsibility, even if the parents are asking for it.\n\nBut the parents are the ones who asked the author to hide the Xbox. If they're delegating that task, perhaps they're sharing responsibility. The author isn't the parent, but they're following the parents' instruction. So maybe the parents are the ones who are in the wrong for not handling it themselves, but the question is about the author.\n\nAlso, the brother's behavior is concerning, so the author's actions are an attempt to address a bigger issue. The key here is whether the means (hiding the Xbox) are justified by the ends (reducing addiction and improving behavior). If the parents are struggling and the author is helping enforce their rules, maybe it's not entirely wrong. However, there's a risk of escalating the problem if the brother feels his autonomy is being violated, leading to more resentment.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong because they're acting under the parents' guidance to address a harmful situation. However, there's a potential for being wrong if the method is not the best approach, but the question is about being an asshole, not about the best solution. The original question is from the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, so the community often looks at intent and context. Since the author's intent is to help and the parents are complicit, the answer might be No (B).\n"
