Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves the brother being addicted to Fortnite, playing excessively, and causing behavioral issues. The parents are aware but struggle to enforce rules, so they asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's addiction is leading to bad grades and outbursts. The parents have rules but he breaks them. The author's parents are actively asking them to hide the Xbox to help manage the situation. The author is acting on their parents' instructions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they're following their parents' orders to address a problematic situation, maybe not. The parents might be trying to protect their son's well-being. However, taking away someone else's property, even if it's their own, could be seen as a violation of trust. But since the parents are involved and the brother is a minor, the parents have authority over household rules. The author is acting as an enforcer here.\n\nAlso, the brother's actions are problematic, and the author is trying to help maintain order. The parents are the ones who set the rules, so the author isn't acting independently without reason. The key point is that the parents are in charge and have asked the author to assist. Therefore, the author isn't at fault for following their parents' directions to address a child's harmful addiction.\n"
