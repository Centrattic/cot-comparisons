Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The brother in middle school is spending way too much time on Fortnite, affecting his grades and behavior. He's even using profanity and being disrespectful. The parents have rules but he's sneaking playtime. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox because they trust him.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to help out by taking action that the parents aren't able to enforce effectively. They might feel it's necessary to protect their brother's well-being. But on the other hand, taking someone else's property without their consent, even if it's for a good reason, could be seen as wrong. The brother bought the Xbox, so hiding it without his knowledge might be a violation of his trust. Also, the author might be overstepping their role as a sibling, even if the parents asked for it. \n\nBut the parents did instruct the author to hide it, so maybe he's following their orders. However, the brother isn't a child anymore if he's in middle school, but he's still a minor. The key points are the negative effects of the addiction and the parents' inability to control it. The author's actions are meant to protect his brother's future, but it's a parent's responsibility to manage their child's behavior. \n\nI think there's a mix here. The author's intention is good, but the method might be questionable. Hiding the Xbox could be seen as a form of punishment without consent. However, since the parents approved the action, it might be justified. But if the brother didn't agree, even if the parents asked, is the author still wrong? The line between helping and interfering is blurry here. \n\nIn the end, the author is acting in what he believes is the right way based on the parents' instruction, but the brother might feel his rights are being violated. The answer depends on whether taking such action without the brother's consent is justified. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the parents authorized it, but it's a close call.\n"
