Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a sibling hiding their brother's Xbox because of his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother is in middle school and has become addicted to Fortnite, playing more than 10 hours on weekends and sneaking playtime on weekdays. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014he's yelling, using profanity, grades are dropping. Parents have tried grounding him but he's manipulative, getting them to give the Xbox back. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox, even though the brother bought it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for hiding the Xbox. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author is following the parents' instructions to help control their brother's addiction. The brother's actions are harmful, affecting his well-being and family dynamics. Hiding the Xbox might be a necessary step to prevent further negative consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the Xbox was bought by the brother, so taking it without his consent might seem like taking his property. However, the parents are the ones who asked the author to do it, implying they have given permission. The parents are the legal guardians, so their authority in the household matters. The brother's actions are problematic, and the author is trying to protect the family environment.\n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping? The parents are the ones making the rules, so if they're asking the sibling to help enforce a grounding or restriction, the author isn't the one making the decision. The parents are. So the responsibility lies with the parents, not the author. The author is acting as an enforcer of the parents' wishes.\n\nHowever, the brother's ownership of the console raises a point about property rights. But in a family context, especially with a child's addiction, the parents' authority takes precedence. The brother's ownership doesn't mean he can abuse the console to the detriment of his health and relationships. The parents are managing his access, and the author is assisting in that management as instructed.\n\nAlso, considering the brother's age and the parents' role in guiding him, the author isn't in the wrong for following their lead. The brother's behavior is the core issue here. The author's actions are a response to protect the family from his addiction's negative effects.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't the one making the decision; the parents are. The action is taken to address a problematic situation caused by the brother's addiction. The author isn't in the wrong because they're following parental instructions to mitigate a harmful behavior.\n"
