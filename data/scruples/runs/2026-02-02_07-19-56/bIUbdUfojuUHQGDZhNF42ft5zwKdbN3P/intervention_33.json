Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother is addicted to Fortnite, playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and even some during the week when parents aren't around. The brother's behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents have rules but the brother breaks them. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox to enforce the rules, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nSo, the author is following the parents' orders. But is hiding the Xbox the right approach? The author's brother has legal ownership of the console. By hiding it, the author is taking away something that isn't theirs, which might be considered wrong. But the parents delegated the task, so maybe they see it as a family matter. However, the brother could argue that his parents are not enforcing rules consistently (since they cave when he screams). The author is acting under parental instruction, but is that justification enough? The author's intent is to help, but the method involves taking something that belongs to the brother. So, maybe the author isn't the one at fault, but it's a gray area. Alternatively, since the parents asked, the author might be in the right. But if the brother's actions are a result of addiction and the parents aren't handling it properly, maybe the author is trying to help. Hmm. The answer could go either way, but the key point is that the parents gave the order, so the author is acting as an enforcer. But ethically, taking someone else's property without their consent is wrong, even if it's for good reasons. However, in family contexts, these lines can be blurred. I need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the action of hiding the Xbox is morally wrong. Considering that the brother's parents are involved and they authorized it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author did it without parental consent, then yes. In this case, the parents told the author to do it. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But some might argue that the author should let the parents handle it. Alternatively, the author is overstepping by taking the console. But given the context, the answer might be B.\n"
