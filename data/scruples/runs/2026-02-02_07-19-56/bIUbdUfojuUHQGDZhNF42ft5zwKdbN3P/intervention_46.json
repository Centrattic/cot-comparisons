Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves a middle school brother with a Fortnite addiction. The parents have rules limiting play to weekends, but the brother breaks these, leading to negative behaviors like yelling and poor grades.\n\nThe author is a sibling taking action by hiding the Xbox on the parents' request. The brother pays for the console, but the parents are using the author to enforce the rule. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, consider the parents' role. They set the rules and then asked their child to enforce them. That's unusual because parents are typically responsible for setting and enforcing boundaries. If the parents can't manage their own child's gaming, delegating that task to another child might be problematic. It could lead to resentment and family tension.\n\nAlso, the brother's behavior is concerning. Using profanity, yelling, and affecting grades indicate deeper issues that just hiding a console might not address. The author might not be at fault for trying to help, but the situation highlights the parents' failure to handle their child's addiction appropriately. The author is following orders, so the main issue might lie with the parents for involving their child in such a role.\n\nHowever, the author could feel conflicted, especially if they have a close relationship with their brother. Hiding the Xbox might be seen as a necessary action from the parents' perspective, but it's not the author's responsibility to enforce such strict measures. The parents should handle their own child's behavior without enlisting another child, which could create a power dynamic that's harmful in the long run.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are more in the wrong here for not handling the situation themselves and putting the burden on their child. The author, acting under their parents' instructions, might not be entirely in the wrong, but the main problem is the parents' approach. However, depending on perspective, some might argue the author is still an asshole for taking sides and enforcing the rule, even if following orders. But given the context, the primary fault lies with the parents, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
