Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother is in middle school and has a significant Fortnite addiction. He's playing 10+ hours on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has worsened\u2014yelling, using profanity, and his grades have dropped. Parents have tried grounding him, but he nags until they give in. The parents then asked the author to hide the Xbox. The author is hiding it to help, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nNow, considering the options. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is taking action without parental direct orders, but they were told to do so by the parents. The brother's behavior is concerning, and the author's actions are aimed at addressing it. However, the brother owns the Xbox, so hiding it might be seen as taking away his property without consent. But since the parents authorized it, maybe that's a factor. \n\nBut wait, the parents did tell the author to hide it. So even though the brother paid for it, the parents are the ones giving permission. That might make the author's action justified because they're following parental instructions. Also, the brother's addiction and negative behavior are real issues. The author is trying to help the family situation, even if the method is a bit drastic. \n\nPotential counterpoints: Is the author overstepping by taking control of the brother's property? But since it's in the parents' home and they've given the go-ahead, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The brother's well-being and academic performance are at stake here. The author's actions could be seen as a necessary intervention. \n\nAnother angle: The brother's addiction is leading to poor behavior and academic issues. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, and the author is helping. Even if the brother paid for the Xbox, the parents might have a responsibility to manage their child's usage. The author acting under parental guidance is part of that management. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the parents' orders and trying to help address a serious issue. The brother's actions are harmful, and the author's intervention is a response to protect the family environment and the brother's future.\n"
