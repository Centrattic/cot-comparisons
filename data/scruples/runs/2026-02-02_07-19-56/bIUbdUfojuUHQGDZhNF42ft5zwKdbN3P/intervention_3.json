Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person hiding their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The context is that the brother has a Fortnite addiction, is playing too much, and his behavior has deteriorated. The parents set rules but he's breaking them. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions: they want to help their brother by limiting his gaming. The parents are involved and have given permission for this action. The brother is acting out, which is affecting his grades and behavior. The author's action is to enforce the parents' rules indirectly because the brother can't or won't follow them on his own.\n\nBut is hiding the Xbox the right approach? The author is taking a proactive step to prevent the brother from breaking the rules again. However, taking someone else's property without their consent can be seen as interfering. Even if the parents asked for it, the brother owns the console. The author might be overstepping by hiding the Xbox instead of letting the parents handle it directly. Also, the brother's behavior is concerning, but the author's method could be seen as a harsh measure. However, the parents are complicit, so maybe it's a family decision. The key points are the parents' involvement and the brother's problematic behavior. If the parents trust the author to act, then maybe it's justified. But if the author is acting without clear parental authority, it might be wrong. The brother's ownership of the Xbox complicates things. The author's action could be seen as a necessary intervention, but it's still taking something that isn't theirs. There's a balance between helping a family member and respecting others' property. The author's intent is good, but the method might be questionable. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The parents' approval might absolve them, but the brother's ownership and the nature of the action could make the author at least partially at fault.\n"
