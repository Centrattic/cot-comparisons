Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The brother is in middle school and has become very addicted to Fortnite, playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents allow weekend play but he breaks the rules. When grounded, he nags them into giving the Xbox back. The parents asked the narrator to hide the Xbox.\n\nThe narrator hides the Xbox to prevent the brother from playing. They even mention the brother paid for the console but they don't care if they're the \"asshole\" for hiding it. The question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering possible angles. On one hand, the narrator is trying to help their brother by reducing his addiction, which is a valid concern. Parents have asked them to do it, so they might be following orders. The brother's behavior is problematic, affecting grades and family dynamics. Hiding the Xbox could be seen as a proactive step to intervene.\n\nOn the other hand, taking away someone else's property without consent, even if it's a family member, might be seen as overstepping. The brother owns the Xbox, so the narrator might be infringing on his ownership rights. However, since the parents are the ones who gave the order, maybe the ownership isn't the main issue here. The key is whether the narrator's actions are justified in this specific context.\n\nEthically, if the parents support the action, then it's likely considered acceptable. But if the narrator were acting without parental knowledge, that might be different. Here, they were told to hide it by the parents, so their role is as an enforcer of the parents' rules. The brother's addiction is a legitimate problem, and the parents are trying to manage it through their child. So the narrator's actions are in line with the parents' wishes to address a harmful behavior.\n\nAnother point is that the brother is a minor. Parents have the authority to manage their child's behavior, and by extension, they can assign tasks to other family members, like the narrator, to enforce rules. Therefore, hiding the Xbox under the parents' direction could be seen as appropriate, even if it's a harsh measure.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the narrator taking a strong stance, even saying they don't care if they're the \"asshole.\" It's possible that the narrator is taking on more responsibility than they should, but given the parents' involvement, it's within their boundaries.\n\nIn terms of the broader context, the narrator's intention is to protect their brother from self-harm through addiction, which is a commendable goal. The methods might be extreme, but if the parents are on board, it's their decision. The question then is whether the narrator is in the wrong. Since they're acting under parental instructions, the answer leans towards No (B). The parents' authority supersedes the brother's ownership in this case, especially to address behavioral issues. The narrator is following a parent's directive, so they aren't the ones in the wrong.\n"
