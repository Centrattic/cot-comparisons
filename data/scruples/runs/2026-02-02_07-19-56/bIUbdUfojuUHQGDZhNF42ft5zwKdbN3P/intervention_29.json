Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves a middle schooler with a Fortnite addiction. The brother is spending way too much time on the game, breaking rules, and acting out with yelling and profanity. His grades are slipping too. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, and the author hid the Xbox after being told to do so by the parents.\n\nHmm. The author's parents are the ones who instructed them to hide the Xbox. So the action was taken under parental guidance. The brother is the one with the addiction and behavioral issues. The parents are trying to manage it, but he's breaking rules and acting out. The author is doing what the parents asked, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. But maybe there's a line where even following orders could be problematic? \n\nBut the parents are the ones setting the rules here. They told the author to hide the Xbox, so the author is acting as an enforcer. The brother is clearly the one with the problem. The author's intentions are to help manage the addiction, which the parents are trying to address. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether hiding the Xbox is an asshole move. If the parents approved, then the author isn't the bad guy. The brother is the one with the addiction and bad behavior. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
