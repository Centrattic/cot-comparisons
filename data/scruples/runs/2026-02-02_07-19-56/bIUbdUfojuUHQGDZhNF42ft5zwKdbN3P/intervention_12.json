Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother is in middle school and has become addicted to Fortnite, playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and even sneaking in playtime during the week. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents set rules but he breaks them, and when grounded, he nags until they give in. The author, likely a sibling, is hiding the Xbox at the parents' request, even though the brother bought it himself.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is following the parents' instructions to help control their brother's addiction, which is affecting the whole family. The brother's behavior is problematic, and hiding the Xbox might be necessary. On the other hand, the brother owns the console, so taking it without his consent might be seen as infringing on his property. Also, the author isn't a parent, so maybe they shouldn't be making such decisions. However, the parents are the ones who asked the author to do this, so they might be acting as enforcers.\n\nBut is the author responsible for their brother's actions? The parents are the ones who should handle their child's behavior. If the author is just following orders, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the author is taking initiative without being asked, that's different. In this case, the parents specifically told them to hide it, so it's more about carrying out a parental directive. Still, the brother owns the Xbox, so taking it might be a violation of his ownership, even if it's for a good reason.\n\nAnother angle: the author's motivation is to protect the family from the brother's negative behavior. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, so having the author assist is a way to help. But is it fair for the author to be the one handling this? Maybe not, but the parents are the ones responsible here. The author might be doing the right thing for the family's well-being, even if it's a tough call.\n\nIn terms of \"asshole\" factor, if the author is acting in the family's best interest as requested by parents, they might not be the asshole. However, if the author is taking it upon themselves without being asked, that could be a problem. The post states that the parents told the author to hide the Xbox, so they're following direct orders. In that case, the author is not the one enforcing the rule; the parents are, through the author.\n\nSo, considering the parents are the ones who made the decision, the author is just executing their plan. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the parents are the ones setting the rules. The real issue is the parents' approach, not the author's action. Hence, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
