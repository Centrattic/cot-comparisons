Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The brother is in middle school, and his Fortnite addiction is causing problems. He's playing 10+ hours on weekends, sneaking playtime during weekdays, using profanity, and his grades are suffering. The parents have tried grounding him, but he yells and nagging them to give back the Xbox. The parents then told the author to hide the Xbox to stop this.\n\nSo the author is taking action on the parents' orders. The key points here are the parents' role and the author's actions. The parents are the ones who asked the author to hide the Xbox. If the parents authorized this action, then the author is following their instructions. However, the author is also noting that the brother paid for the console. But the parents might still have authority over the child's belongings since he's a minor. \n\nThe ethical considerations here involve whether the parents' request justifies the author's actions. The brother's behavior is problematic, affecting his grades and family interactions. The author is trying to prevent this by hiding the Xbox, which is a method of intervention. Since the parents are involved and have given the go-ahead, the author isn't acting independently without their consent. \n\nBut maybe there's a different angle. If the author is taking over responsibility that should be the parents', but the parents are clearly involved here. They're the ones who set the rules and asked the author to hide the Xbox. The brother's actions are out of control, and the parents aren't effective on their own. The author is stepping in to enforce the rules that the parents set. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The parents are the ones who have the authority, and they're asking for help. The author is acting as an enforcer. The brother's addiction is a legitimate issue, and the author's actions are part of a solution. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they're following the parents' wishes and trying to address a real problem. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author is enabling the parents to take away their own child's property, but since it's for the child's well-being and under parental authority, it's justified. The brother's actions are harmful, so the intervention is necessary. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
