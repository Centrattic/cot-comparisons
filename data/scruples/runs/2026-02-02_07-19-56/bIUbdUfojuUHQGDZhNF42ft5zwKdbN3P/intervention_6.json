Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation is that the brother is addicted to Fortnite, is playing too much, has bad behavior, and the parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is helping the parents by hiding the Xbox. The parents have already tried grounding the brother, but he manipulates them back. The brother is in middle school, so he's a minor, and his actions are causing problems like poor grades and bad behavior. The parents are the ones who gave the author the task to hide the Xbox, so maybe the author is acting under their authority.\n\nOn one hand, the author is taking a direct action to enforce the parents' rules. The brother is breaking the rules, and the parents are struggling to control him. The author is trying to help. On the other hand, hiding someone's property without their consent might seem like a problem. But in this case, the brother is a child, and the parents are responsible for managing his behavior. The author is the sibling acting on the parents' behalf.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the brother pays for the console. But if the parents are in charge of the family environment, they might have the right to control access to devices that affect the child's well-being. The author isn't taking the Xbox permanently; they're hiding it to prevent misuse, not stealing it. \n\nThe key points are: the parents' request, the brother's problematic behavior, and the author's role in enforcing parental rules. Even though hiding the Xbox could be seen as interfering, it's done under the parents' instruction and aims to correct the brother's issues. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer could be B (No). But maybe there's another angle. Is the author overstepping? Well, they were told to do this by the parents, so it's within their boundaries. The brother's actions are harmful, so the author is trying to help. I think the answer is B.\n"
