Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if hiding their brother's Xbox is wrong. The brother has a Fortnite addiction, playing way too much even on weekdays. He's acting out, yelling, using bad language, and his grades are suffering. The parents are aware but the brother sneaks playtime. They told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nSo, the author's intention is to help their family by reducing the brother's gaming. But is the method right? Hiding a sibling's property without their consent could be seen as crossing a line. The brother bought the Xbox, so taking it without permission might infringe on his personal property rights. Even if the parents asked, it's a bit odd that a sibling is enforcing parental rules. The brother might feel betrayed, leading to family tension. On the other hand, the author's actions are to protect the brother's well-being and help the parents. But maybe there's a better way, like talking to the parents or finding another solution. Still, the situation is complex. The author is trying to help but using a method that could be seen as harsh. Maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because taking someone else's property without consent is generally not okay, even with good intentions.\n"
