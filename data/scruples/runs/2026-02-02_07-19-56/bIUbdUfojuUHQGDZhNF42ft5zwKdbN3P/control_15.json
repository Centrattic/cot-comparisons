Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hid their brother's Xbox is at fault. The situation involves a middle schooler with a Fortnite addiction, leading to bad behavior, poor grades, and family conflict. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, the brother's addiction is a problem. He's breaking rules, being disrespectful, and his grades are suffering. The parents are trying to manage this, but the brother is sneaking playtime. The author, following the parents' orders, hides the Xbox to prevent him from playing. The author feels justified because they want to help the situation.\n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, they're acting on their parents' instructions. The parents are trying to control their son's addiction. The author isn't causing the addiction but is taking steps as per adult guidance. The brother's behavior is problematic, so the action is to mitigate harm. The author might be seen as helping enforce boundaries set by parents. Alternatively, could there be unintended consequences? Maybe, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the parents approved the action, the author isn't violating any rules. So the answer is B.\n"
