Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The brother is in middle school and has been playing a lot, even sneaking in playtime on weekdays. His behavior has gotten worse, with yelling, swearing, and bad grades. The parents have tried grounding him, but he nags them until they give in. The parents then asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe author's main concern is their brother's excessive gaming leading to negative behaviors and poor grades. The parents have given them permission to hide the Xbox. The brother is old enough to be in middle school, so maybe around 12-14 years old. The parents are trying to intervene but are ineffective because the brother nags them. \n\nThe author is acting on the parents' request. Hiding the Xbox is a form of intervention to prevent the brother from accessing the game. However, the brother owns the console, which complicates things. The author might be overstepping if they're not supposed to take matters into their own hands, but the parents are involved and have approved the action. \n\nMoral and legal perspectives: Legally, the parents are the guardians and have the authority to manage their child's activities. If they asked the author to do this, it's within their rights. Morally, the author is trying to help the brother, even if their methods are harsh. The brother's addiction is affecting his grades and behavior, so the author's actions could be seen as necessary. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author shouldn't interfere in parental decisions. But since the parents are the ones initiating the action and asking the author to help, the author is following their lead. \n\nThe brother's actions are problematic, so the intervention is aimed at correcting harmful behavior. The author's role is to enforce the parents' rules. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting under parental guidance to address a legitimate issue.\n"
