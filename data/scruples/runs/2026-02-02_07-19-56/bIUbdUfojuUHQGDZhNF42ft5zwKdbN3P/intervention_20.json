Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The brother has a Fortnite addiction, leading to bad behavior and poor grades. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox. The author's stance is that they are in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother is in middle school and is clearly struggling with an addiction. He's breaking the household rules by sneaking in extra playtime and showing disrespect. His grades are slipping, and his behavior is deteriorating. The parents have tried grounding him, but he manipulates them into letting him play again. The author, as a sibling, is being asked by the parents to take action by hiding the Xbox. The brother owns the console, but the parents are asking the author to help enforce discipline.\n\nNow, the author is doing what the parents instructed. The parents are the authority figures here, and the author is acting as an enforcer. The brother is being rebellious and disrespectful, and the author is trying to protect the family environment from his negative behavior. The author's actions, while perhaps harsh, are in line with the parents' wishes to address the addiction and its consequences.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the brother might see it as a betrayal, but the author is following the parents' directions. The parents might not be able to enforce the rules themselves due to the brother's manipulation. The author's role here is to support the parents in maintaining discipline. The brother's actions are harmful, and the author's intervention is aimed at helping the brother break the addiction, even if it's through force.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author is a sibling, not a parent, so stepping into a parental role might be overstepping. But given the context that the parents explicitly told them to do this, it's part of their involvement in the family's dynamics. The author's actions are with the parents' consent, making it a shared responsibility. The brother's addiction is the root issue, and the parents are seeking help from their child to address it.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author is trying to protect the brother's well-being, albeit in a strict way. The brother's behavior is problematic, and the parents are trying to intervene. The author's role is a difficult one, but they are acting in line with the parents' wishes. So, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're following orders and trying to help the family situation.\n"
