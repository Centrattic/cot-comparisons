Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school and has a significant problem with gaming. He's playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. His behavior is deteriorating\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents have rules but he's breaking them, and when grounded, he nags until they give in. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox, so the author is acting on their behalf.\n\nThe key points here: the author's parents are the ones who instructed them to hide the Xbox. The brother bought the console himself, but the parents are the ones enforcing the rules. The author's action is to stop the brother's harmful behavior as per parental guidance. Even though the Xbox is his brother's, the parents are delegating the task to the author. \n\nIs the author taking control they shouldn't? Since the parents are the authority and they asked the author to do this, the author is following their orders. The brother's addiction is affecting his grades and family dynamics. The author's motivation is to help, not to take the Xbox for personal gain. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Maybe the author is overstepping by taking control of the Xbox, but since the parents approved, it's within their boundaries. Also, the brother's ownership of the console doesn't negate the parents' authority. The parents can make rules about its usage, so the author acting on their behalf isn't wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following parental instructions to address a bigger problem. The answer should be B.\n"
