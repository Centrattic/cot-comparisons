Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for hiding their brother's Xbox because of his Fortnite addiction. The brother is in middle school, which is a tough age. The brother's playing a lot, even sneaking in weekday playtime. His behavior has gotten worse\u2014he yells, uses profanity, and his grades are slipping. The parents allow weekend play, but he breaks the rules. When grounded, he screams until they give in. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox, so the author is doing that.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but wants opinions. Let's consider the points. The author is following the parents' orders. The parents are the ones who set the rules, and they trusted the author to enforce them. Hiding the Xbox is a way to prevent the brother from playing, which is part of the parents' disciplinary action. The brother's addiction and behavior are problematic, and the parents are trying to manage it. The author isn't taking the Xbox away without reason; they're acting on the parents' instructions. Also, the brother paid for it, but maybe the parents have responsibility over their child's behavior and gaming habits. \n\nBut some might argue that the author is taking sides or being a tattletale, but since the parents asked them to do it, maybe it's justified. The brother's actions are harmful, and the author is trying to help. However, is hiding the Xbox an appropriate method? Maybe there are better ways, but the author is doing what they're told. The key here is the parents' involvement. Since they authorized the action, the author isn't acting out of their own accord but as part of the parents' strategy. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're following the parents' wishes to address a serious issue.\n"
