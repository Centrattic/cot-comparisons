Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves a middle school brother addicted to Fortnite, playing excessive hours, and causing behavioral issues. The parents tried grounding him, but he nags them into giving it back. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' authority. The parents have rules about weekend play, but the brother is sneaking playtime. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox, so maybe the author is following their instructions. But is it the parents' responsibility to enforce the rules, or should the author be involved?\n\nThe brother's actions include yelling, using profanity, and poor grades. The author is trying to help the family by hiding the Xbox. But is it the author's place to take such action? Maybe the parents should handle it themselves. However, the author might be in a position where they feel necessary to act, especially if the parents aren't effective.\n\nThe author is taking a proactive step, but it could lead to resentment or conflict between siblings. However, given the brother's behavior, the author's intention is to prevent harm. The parents are the ones who authorized this action, so maybe the author isn't wrong. But is it the parent's responsibility to manage the situation without their child's intervention?\n\nAlso, the brother paid for the Xbox. The author is hiding it, which might be seen as taking something that belongs to another person. But the parents asked for it, so perhaps the ownership aspect is covered by the parents' request. The author is obeying a parent's instruction, which could justify the action.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author's intent is to help, but the method involves taking someone else's property. However, given the context and the parents' involvement, the author might not be in the wrong. The key points are the parents' approval and the brother's harmful behavior. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents are the ones who assigned the task, but I need to make sure there's no other angle where the author overstepped.\n"
