Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about hiding a brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school, so he's a minor. The parents have rules about playing on weekends, but he's sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, bad grades. The parents tried grounding him, but he's manipulative, making them cave. The parents then asked the author (the sibling) to hide the Xbox. The author is conflicted but determined to do it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, what's the right approach here? Legally, the parents have authority over their child's behavior. They're asking the author to help enforce their rules. If the parents are okay with it, then the author isn't acting against their will. But ethically, is hiding the Xbox justifiable?\n\nThe brother's addiction is affecting his school and relationships. The parents are struggling to manage it. The author is trying to help by taking action. But the brother paid for the console himself. Hmm, that's a point. But since he's a minor, maybe the parents have control over his belongings, even if he paid for them? Or maybe he's working to afford it? The question is whether hiding it's wrong.\n\nIn some cases, parents might involve others to enforce discipline. The author is following the parents' orders. However, there's a line between helping and taking matters into their own hands. But since the parents are the ones who gave the okay, maybe the author isn't at fault. The brother's actions are problematic, so the author's intent is to help.\n\nBut wait, the author is a sibling. Is it appropriate for a sibling to hide the parent's property? If the parents are the ones who asked, then it's part of their parenting strategy. The author might not be responsible here. The main issue is whether the action is wrong when done under parental authority.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is acting within the parents' instructions to help manage their child's behavior. The parents are the ones in charge, and the author is supporting their decision. The brother's behavior is the problem, not the author's intervention as per the parents' wishes.\n"
