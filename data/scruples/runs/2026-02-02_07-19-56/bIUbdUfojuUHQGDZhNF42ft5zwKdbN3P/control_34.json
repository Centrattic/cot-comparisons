Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation is that the brother is in middle school, has a heavy Fortnite addiction, breaks the house rules by playing on weekdays, behaves badly, uses profanity, and his grades have dropped. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox because they can't handle the brother's outbursts when he's grounded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and responsibility of the author. If the author is a sibling, maybe they're a teenager or a younger child. The parents are the ones setting the rules, and they've entrusted the author to help enforce them. The brother is clearly not following the agreed-upon rules, so the parents are trying to manage his behavior through the author.\n\nHiding the Xbox is a form of enforcement. The brother paid for the console, but if the parents own the house and the family, they might have a say in how it's used. The author's actions are in line with the parents' instructions, so from that angle, the author is acting as a helper. However, some might argue that the author is taking on a parent's role, which could be inappropriate, especially if they're not much older. But in this case, the parents explicitly asked them to do it, so they're following orders.\n\nThen there's the brother's behavior. Using profanity and yelling is concerning, so the parents might feel they need to take stronger measures. The author is trying to protect the family environment from the brother's negative behavior. Since the parents are struggling to enforce the rules themselves, the author's intervention could be seen as necessary. \n\nBut maybe the author could have talked to the brother first or found a different solution? However, given that the brother is sneaking playtime and the parents are already dealing with his outbursts, hiding the Xbox might be the only way to prevent him from accessing it when he shouldn't. The author's intention is to help the family, not to be cruel. The brother's addiction is affecting his grades and behavior, so limiting his access is in his best interest. \n\nI think the key points here are that the parents authorized the action, the brother is violating rules, and the author is acting to support family discipline. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
