Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school and has a Fortnite addiction. He's playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaks playtime during the week. The parents have rules but he's breaking them. His behavior has become aggressive, including yelling and using profanity. His grades have dropped since the addiction started. When grounded, he throws tantrums until parents give in. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox without telling them, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nSo, the author is acting on their parents' request. The brother's behavior is problematic, affecting his school and family. The parents are trying to enforce rules but struggling because the brother manipulates them. The author's action is to prevent the brother from accessing the Xbox, which is a way to enforce the parents' rules. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents authorized the action. The brother's actions are clearly causing issues, so hiding the Xbox is a form of intervention. The author might be doing a necessary action to help their brother, albeit in a strict way. The brother's addiction is harmful, and the parents are trying to manage it through their children, which might not be ideal, but the author is following their lead. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother paid for the Xbox, so ownership is a factor. But the parents are the ones who set the rules, so they might have authority over the console despite the brother buying it. The author's intent is to help the brother by reducing his addiction, which is a valid concern given the negative impact. The author isn't acting out of spite but to correct a harmful behavior. \n\nI think the key points are the parents' approval, the brother's problematic behavior, and the intent behind hiding the Xbox. The author isn't acting maliciously but trying to help. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
