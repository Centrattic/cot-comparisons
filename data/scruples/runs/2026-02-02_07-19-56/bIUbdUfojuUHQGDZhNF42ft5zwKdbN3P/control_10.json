Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox because the brother is addicted to Fortnite. The brother is in middle school, and his gaming habits are causing problems: yelling, using profanity, bad grades. The parents set rules but the brother breaks them. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox, so they did, even though the brother paid for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics here. The parents are the authority figures, and they've asked the author to help by hiding the Xbox. The brother's behavior is clearly problematic. The author's actions are meant to enforce the parents' rules, even though they're taking it upon themselves.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents gave them the task, so following their instructions might not be wrong. However, the author is taking a direct action that affects their brother's property. But the brother's addiction is causing issues in the household. The author might be acting out of concern for their brother's well-being and the family's peace. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the parents should handle it themselves, not delegate to another child. But the parents might not want to confront the brother directly because he's aggressive. The author is stepping in to enforce the rules when the parents can't. \n\nThe brother's behavior is out of control, so the author's intervention, though possibly harsh, might be justified. The parents' approval is important here. Since they asked the author to do it, it's probably not the author's fault. The brother is the one with the addiction and the bad behavior. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They're following the parents' wishes to help correct their brother's harmful behavior.\n"
