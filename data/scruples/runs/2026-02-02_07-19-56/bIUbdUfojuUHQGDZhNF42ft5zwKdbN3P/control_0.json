Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation is that the brother is addicted to Fortnite, playing 10+ hours on weekends and even sneaking in weekday play. He yells, uses profanity, and his grades have gone down. The parents set rules but he breaks them. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nHmm. The author's actions are based on concerns about their brother's behavior. The brother's addiction is causing problems: yelling, bad language, poor grades. The parents are clearly involved but not doing enough because they cave when he screams. The author is taking action because they want to help their brother. But is hiding the Xbox wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author is following their parents' request. The parents told them to hide the Xbox, so they're acting as agents of the parents. Their intention is to stop the brother's harmful behavior. They might not be in the wrong if they're enforcing the parents' decision.\n\nBut on the other hand, the brother owns the Xbox. Hiding it might be seen as taking away something he owns, even if it's for his own good. But since the parents are involved and they gave the order, maybe it's justified. The brother's behavior is problematic, so the action is meant to protect him and the family from negative effects. The author isn't doing this out of spite but concern. But is it their responsibility to intervene this way? The parents are supposed to handle their child's behavior. However, the parents are ineffective, so the author is stepping in. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to help their brother, and the parents are aware and supporting the action. The brother's addiction is harmful, and the author is doing what they can to stop it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
