Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation is that the brother is addicted to Fortnite, playing 10+ hours on weekends and sneaking extra time during the week. He's been rude, using profanity, and his grades have dropped. The parents set rules, but he breaks them. They told the author to hide the Xbox. The author is doing it even though the brother paid for the console.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's behavior is problematic\u2014excessive gaming, yelling, bad grades. The parents are trying to manage this by having a rule, but the brother isn't following it. The author is taking action because the parents asked them to. The brother owns the Xbox, but the parents are the ones who gave the instruction to hide it. So, the author is acting on behalf of the parents to enforce the rules. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother paid for the Xbox, but if the parents gave the Xbox to him, maybe they have some authority over its use. The parents might have given the console with the condition that he follows their rules. If the author is following the parents' orders, then maybe they're not at fault. However, the brother might see it as the author taking control of his property without permission. But the parents' role in allowing the author to hide it complicates things. \n\nOn one hand, the author is helping to enforce rules set by the parents. On the other hand, the Xbox is the brother's property. But in a family setting, especially with a minor, parents usually make decisions about the use of items bought for their children. The brother's addiction and negative behavior might justify the parents' intervention. The author's actions are part of that intervention. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're following parental instructions to protect the brother from harmful behavior. The parents are the ones who set the rules, so the author is acting within their guidance. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
