Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote about hiding their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. They provided the situation where the brother is addicted to Fortnite, causing issues at home. The parents have rules but the brother is breaking them, leading to bad behavior and poor grades.\n\nSo, the author's parents asked them to hide the Xbox. The author is doing this to help manage their brother's addiction. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The parents are the ones who gave the author the responsibility. The brother is breaking rules, which is affecting the household. The author is taking action as per the parents' request. \n\nBut maybe there's a conflict here. The brother paid for the console, so does hiding it without his knowledge interfere with his ownership? However, parents usually have authority over children's activities, especially when it's about their well-being. The author is acting under the parents' orders, so maybe it's justified. \n\nAnother angle: the brother is a middle schooler, so around 12 years old. Parents have the responsibility to manage their child's behavior. The author is assisting in that. The brother's actions are harmful\u2014poor grades, disrespectful behavior. Hiding the Xbox could be a way to enforce boundaries. \n\nBut is the author overstepping? They might not be in the wrong because they're following the parents' instructions. The parents are the ones who should determine the rules. The author is trying to support their parents in controlling their brother's addiction. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel disrespected if his Xbox is hidden without his knowledge. However, considering the negative consequences, the parents and author might be acting in his best interest. \n\nI think the key points are the parents' authority, the brother's harmful behavior, and the author acting as an enforcer. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
