Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation involves a middle schooler with a Fortnite addiction, leading to behavioral issues, poor grades, and conflicts with family. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother is a minor, in middle school, so he's around 11-14 years old. The author is likely a sibling, maybe older. The parents are trying to manage their son's gaming addiction but are struggling because the brother is sneaking playtime and reacting negatively when grounded. The author is following the parents' instruction to hide the Xbox to prevent the brother from accessing it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents authorized the action, so the author is acting on their behalf. The brother's addiction is causing problems, so the parents are trying to enforce rules. The author is complying with the parents' order, which is a form of parental control. However, maybe there are concerns about the method. Hiding the Xbox might not address the root issue, but the author isn't the one making the rules here. The key point is whether the author is overstepping by taking direct action, especially since the Xbox was purchased by the brother. But the parents have the authority to manage the child's behavior and belongings. So the author is acting under parental guidance, which might make it not their fault. Alternatively, some might argue that the author shouldn't take sides between siblings or interfere with the brother's property. But since the parents are involved and have given the order, it's more about following family rules. The author's intention is to help, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. The brother's actions are problematic, and the parents are trying to intervene. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
