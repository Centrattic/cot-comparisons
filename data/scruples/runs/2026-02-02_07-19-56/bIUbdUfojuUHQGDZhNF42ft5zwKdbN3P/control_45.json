Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to Fortnite addiction. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother is a middle schooler with a significant Fortnite addiction. He's playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaks playtime on weekdays. His behavior is deteriorating\u2014using profanity, yelling, bad grades. Parents are trying to manage it but he's resisting. The parents have asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' involvement and the author's role. The author is acting on the parents' instruction, so they're following orders. The parents are the ones setting the rules, and they've delegated this task to the author. The brother's actions are problematic, and the parents are trying to intervene. The author is just enforcing the parents' decision. \n\nBut wait, is there any issue with the author taking this action? The brother bought the Xbox himself. Does that matter? The author is the one hiding it, which could be seen as interfering with the brother's property. However, since the parents are the ones who gave the author the task, they have authority over the situation. The author isn't acting independently but as part of the parents' strategy. \n\nAlso, considering the brother's age and the parents' responsibility for his well-being. The parents are trying to address his addiction and behavior, and they're using the author as an enforcer. The author's intention is to help the family situation, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is taking matters into their own hands, but in this case, the parents are directly involved. So the author's action is supported by the parents. \n\nAnother angle: the brother's reaction to being grounded. He screams and nags, which the parents eventually cave in. By hiding the Xbox, the author might be preventing that cycle, which is a positive outcome. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're acting under the parents' direction to help manage a problematic situation. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
