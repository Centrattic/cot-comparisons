Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The scenario is presented in an AITA (Am I the Asshole) format, so I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school and has a significant addiction to Fortnite. He's playing over 10 hours on weekends and sneaking in weekday play when parents aren't home. His behavior is deteriorating: yelling, using profanity, and poor grades. When grounded, he screams and nags until parents give in. The parents then asked the author to hide the Xbox. The author is considering if they're in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' role and the author's actions. The parents are the ones who set the rules and are struggling to enforce them. They've asked the author to hide the Xbox, which means they've entrusted the author with this task. The author isn't taking the Xbox for personal gain but to help manage their brother's addiction. The brother is an adult? Wait, no\u2014middle school, so he's a minor. The Xbox was paid for by the brother, but he's a child, so the parents likely own the console or at least have control over it. The author is following the parents' directive to enforce boundaries. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: They're taking away something that doesn't belong to them. But the parents gave them permission. Also, maybe the author is being too harsh, but the brother's behavior is concerning. The parents are the responsible adults here, and they're using the author as an enforcer. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're following parents' instructions to help a sibling who's clearly struggling with addiction and bad behavior. The parents are the ones who should be handling this, but they're enlisting the author's help. So B (No, not in the wrong) seems right. The author isn't acting out of spite but trying to help. The brother's actions justify the intervention. The parents' role is to set boundaries, and the author is assisting in that. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
