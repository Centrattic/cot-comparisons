Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves a middle school brother with a Fortnite addiction, leading to bad behavior and poor grades. The parents allowed weekend play but the brother sneaks weekday play. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to help their brother by reducing his addiction. But is hiding the Xbox the right approach? The brother owns the console, so taking it without permission might be an issue. However, the parents gave the author this task, so maybe they see it as a necessary action. The brother's behavior is concerning, and the author is trying to prevent negative consequences.\n\nBut there's a line between helping and overstepping. Even if the parents approved, the author might be taking on a role they aren't responsible for. The brother might feel victimized, and the author's actions could damage their relationship. Also, the author's justification is about wanting to stop the brother's harmful behavior, but using their own method (hiding the Xbox) without the brother's consent could be seen as controlling or manipulative.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are involved and have given their consent, so the author might not be entirely at fault. The brother's addiction is a real problem that needs addressing. But the method might be questionable. The author's role as a sibling is complex here. While the intent is good, the action could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since the brother is paying for the console himself. The author is using a form of control without the brother's agreement, which might not be fair.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The parents' endorsement might mitigate some responsibility, but the act of hiding someone else's property without their consent could be problematic. However, the underlying issue is the brother's addiction, which is serious. The author's actions are a form of intervention, but maybe the right approach would be for the parents to enforce rules consistently or seek other solutions. The author might not be in the wrong if the parents support it, but there's a case to be made that they are overstepping, especially if the brother's rights as an individual (owning the console) are considered.\n\nIn the end, the answer depends on perspective. If the parents are fully on board and the author is following their instructions, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the author is acting on their own initiative without considering other solutions, then maybe they are. But given the context provided, the parents directed the action, so the answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that even with parental approval, manipulating someone's access to their own property is wrong. Hmm.\n"
