Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The situation is that the brother is in middle school, playing over 10 hours on weekends, sneaking playtime during the week, getting bad grades, and being disrespectful. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's addiction is causing problems: academic issues, disrespectful behavior, and maybe even affecting family dynamics. The parents are involved but seem to give in when the brother nags them. The author is taking action because they're not being respectful and the parents are relying on them to enforce the rules.\n\nNow, the question is whether hiding the Xbox makes the author the asshole. On one hand, the author is trying to help their brother by limiting his gaming, which could be seen as a positive intent. The parents have given them this responsibility, so maybe it's not the author's fault. On the other hand, hiding someone's property without permission could be considered theft or interfering, but in this case, it's for the brother's own good. However, the brother bought the console, so there's a question about ownership and consent.\n\nBut considering the parents are the ones who asked the author to do this, it's part of their parenting strategy. The brother's behavior is problematic, so the action is intended to protect him from himself. The author might not be in the wrong because they're following parental instructions and trying to help. The brother's addiction and disrespectful behavior are the main issues here.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is acting in what they believe is the brother's best interest under parental guidance. The wrongdoer here is the brother's addiction and behavior, not the author's action to enforce the rules set by the parents.\n"
