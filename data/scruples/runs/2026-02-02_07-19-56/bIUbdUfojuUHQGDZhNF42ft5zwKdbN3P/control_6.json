Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. Let's break down the situation. The brother is a middle schooler who's really addicted to Fortnite. He's playing way more than the parents allow, even on weekdays when they're not home. His behavior has gotten worse\u2014he's yelling, using profanity, and his grades are slipping. The parents try to ground him, but he nags them until they give in. The author hides the Xbox because their parents asked them to.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons. They're trying to help their parents enforce rules. The parents are struggling to manage their son's gaming addiction, which is affecting his behavior and grades. The author isn't doing this out of spite but to help. The parents explicitly told them to hide the Xbox, so they're acting under parental guidance. \n\nBut wait, hiding someone else's property might be an issue. The brother paid for the console, but he's a minor. Parents typically have authority over their child's belongings and actions. The author is following their parents' orders, which are in the best interest of the family. The brother's addiction is a problem that needs intervention. The author might be seen as a necessary enforcer here. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's not the author's place to interfere. However, given the parents' involvement and the brother's harmful behavior, the author's actions could be seen as justified. The parents are the ones who set the rules, and they trust the author to enforce them. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are part of a plan to help their brother break his addiction and restore family harmony. The answer should be B.\n"
