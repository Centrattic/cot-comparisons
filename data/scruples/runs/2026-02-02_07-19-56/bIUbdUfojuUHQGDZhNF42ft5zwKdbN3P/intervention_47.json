      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox because he's addicted to Fortnite. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school, which is around 11-14 years old. The author mentions that their brother is spending 10+ hours a day on Fortnite, even on weekdays when he's supposed to be restricted to weekends. The parents have rules, but he's sneaking playtime. The brother's behavior has gotten worse: yelling, using profanity, disrespect towards family, and poor grades since Fortnite. When grounded, he screams and nags until the parents give in. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox, even though the brother paid for it. The author is conflicted but determined to do it, hence the AITA question.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nLet me consider both sides. On one hand, the author is following their parents' orders to prevent the brother from gaming. The brother's addiction is causing behavioral issues and affecting his schoolwork. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, so the author is helping them. By hiding the Xbox, the author is trying to protect their brother from harmful addiction, perhaps in the long run. The brother's actions are problematic, so maybe the author is justified in taking this step.\n\nOn the other hand, the Xbox was paid for by the brother, so hiding it without his knowledge might be considered taking away his property. Also, the author is taking a parent's role by hiding the console, which could lead to resentment or conflict. The brother might feel betrayed by the sibling instead of the parent. However, the parents are the ones who asked the author to do this, so maybe the responsibility lies with the parents, not the author. But is it right for the author to be involved in such a way? It could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author is around the same age or younger than the brother.\n\nAnother angle: the brother's behavior is harmful. If the author is trying to help, maybe they're not in the wrong. The parents are using the author as a helper, which might be a bit unfair, but if the author agrees to it, maybe they feel responsible. However, the brother might not see it the same way, leading to family tension. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents asked them to do it, then perhaps it's not the author's own decision, but they're following orders. But does that absolve them of wrongdoing?\n\nIn some cases, when parents ask kids to enforce rules, the siblings might be seen as enforcers, which can be a tough role. The author might be trying to help, but the act of hiding property could be seen as a violation of trust. Also, the brother might feel that the author is betraying him. However, the author's intention is to help, not to be mean. So maybe the action is not wrong in intent, but in execution.\n\nI think the key points are the brother's addiction and its negative effects, the parents' inability to control the situation, and the author acting as a proxy. If the parents are the ones making the decision, the author is just following their lead. In that case, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the author is taking initiative without the parents' input, it's different. However, the parents did tell them to hide it. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're following parental instructions to help a sibling with a serious problem. The brother's behavior is concerning, and the author is trying to intervene. The \"wrong\" here depends on the context of the family dynamics and the parents' involvement. Since the parents are the ones who asked the author to do it, it's a family matter where the author is supporting the parents' authority. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
