Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation is that the brother is a middle schooler with a Fortnite addiction, playing 10+ hours on weekends and even sneaking play on weekdays. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents have rules but aren't enforcing them effectively. The parents then told the author to hide the Xbox because they can handle the brother better. The author is conflicted but determined to do it anyway.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the parents are the ones responsible for managing their child's behavior. By asking the author to hide the Xbox, they're delegating that responsibility to a sibling. Even though the brother is acting out, the parents should be the ones setting boundaries. The author is taking matters into their own hands, which might lead to family tension. However, the brother's behavior is clearly problematic, and the parents aren't handling it effectively. The author is trying to help, but is it their responsibility?\n\nOn one hand, kids shouldn't have to manage their siblings' behavior. It's the parents' role. The author might be overstepping, possibly leading to a breakdown in family dynamics. On the other hand, the brother's actions are harmful, and the parents are failing to intervene properly. The author is acting out of concern for the household's well-being.\n\nBut hiding the Xbox is a form of punishment without the parents' direct involvement. Even if the intention is good, it's not the author's place to do. The brother might feel betrayed, and the parents might not have considered all consequences. The author could be seen as taking a parent's role, which isn't fair to either the brother or the parents.\n\nAlso, the brother is paying for the console. Hiding it could be seen as theft or misuse of property. Legally, that's a stretch, but morally, if it's his property, the author shouldn't take it without consent. Even if the parents own the house, the console was purchased by the brother, so he has some claim to it.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable given the context. The author is trying to help, but the method might be wrong. The parents should handle it, not the sibling. So even though the situation is bad, the author is in the wrong for taking that step. The answer is A.\n"
