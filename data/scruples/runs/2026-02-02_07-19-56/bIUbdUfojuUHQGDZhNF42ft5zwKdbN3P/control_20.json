Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's brother is addicted to Fortnite, playing way too much, which is affecting his behavior and grades. The parents have rules but the brother is sneaking playtime. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox to enforce the rules. The question is whether the author is at fault for hiding the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' role. They set the rules about when the brother can play, but he's breaking them. The parents tried grounding him, but he's getting back the Xbox through nagging. Now they've asked the author to hide it to prevent him from playing. The author is doing what the parents asked, even though the Xbox was bought by the brother.\n\nThe brother's actions are problematic: yelling, using profanity, bad grades. The author is trying to help the family by enforcing the parents' wishes. But is the author overstepping? Well, since the parents are the authority figures and they delegated this task to the author, maybe it's justified. The brother is a minor, so the parents have the responsibility to manage his behavior. The author isn't taking the Xbox; they're just hiding it as per the parents' instructions. The brother's addiction is a bigger issue, and the parents are trying to address it. The author isn't being cruel here; they're helping enforce rules to protect their brother's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have let the parents handle it directly instead of getting involved. But since the parents specifically told them to do this, it's part of their plan. Also, the brother's behavior is affecting the whole family, so the author might feel responsible. The key point is that the parents are the ones setting the rules, and the author is acting on their behalf. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B.\n"
