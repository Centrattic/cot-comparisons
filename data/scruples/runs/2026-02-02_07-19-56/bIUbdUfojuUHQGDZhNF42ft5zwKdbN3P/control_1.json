Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The situation involves the brother's Fortnite addiction leading to bad behavior, poor grades, and conflicts at home. The parents have rules but the brother is sneaking around them, and the parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations and actions of the author. The author is trying to help their parents manage their brother's addiction, which is causing multiple problems. The brother is in middle school, which is a critical time for development, and excessive gaming can interfere with school and family dynamics. The parents are struggling because they can't enforce rules effectively against their son's addiction. The author is taking action because they want to support their parents and reduce the negative impacts on the family.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author is acting on behalf of the parents. The parents explicitly told them to hide the Xbox, so the author is following their instructions. While hiding the Xbox might seem like a harsh measure, it's intended to protect the brother from his own addiction. The brother's behavior has deteriorated, so the parents and the author are trying to intervene. \n\nHowever, there are potential downsides. The author is taking a role that might be seen as overstepping, especially if they're not the parent. But given that the parents are the ones who asked them to do it, the responsibility lies with the parents. The author is following their guidance. Also, the brother's rights to his own console might be a point of contention, but since he's a minor and the parents are the legal guardians, they have the authority to make such decisions for his well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there are better ways to handle the addiction, like family therapy, setting clearer boundaries, or using parental controls. The author is using a direct method, which could be seen as a last resort. But considering the parents' involvement, the author isn't acting independently. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the family dynamics. The author might be taking sides, which could affect their relationship with their brother. However, the brother's behavior is already causing issues, so this action might be necessary to prevent further harm. The author's intention is to help, not to be cruel. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are in line with the parents' wishes and aimed at addressing a harmful situation. While hiding the Xbox is a drastic step, the parents are responsible here, and the author is assisting them. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B).\n"
