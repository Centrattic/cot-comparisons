Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The situation involves a middle schooler who's playing a lot, even beyond the allowed time, and exhibiting bad behavior because of it. The parents asked the sibling to hide the Xbox. So, who's at fault here?\n\nFirst, the brother's addiction is a problem. He's playing too much, affecting his grades and behavior. The parents are trying to control it but he's sneaking in playtime. The author's role is to hide the Xbox as per the parents' request. But the brother bought the console himself. So, is the author justified in taking it?\n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they asked the sibling to hide the Xbox to enforce their rules. The author is following their instructions. However, the brother might see it as theft, especially since he owns the console. Legally, taking someone else's property without permission is theft, but in a family context, things can be more complex. The parents' authority might override that, since they're the ones making the rules. But the brother paid for it, so there's a personal investment there.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as helping the parents enforce discipline, which is their role. On the other hand, the author is taking responsibility for the brother's behavior, which might not be their place. But since the parents are involved and gave the order, maybe it's justified. The key point is that the parents are the ones who set the rules, and the author is acting on their behalf. So the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the parents' wishes to address the brother's problematic behavior. The brother is the one with the addiction issue. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
