Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The brother is addicted to Fortnite, which is causing problems at home. The parents have rules about weekend play, but the brother sneaks in on weekdays. He's been rude, his grades have dropped, and when grounded, he yells. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents asked them to do it. They might be trying to help their brother by reducing his gaming time, which is causing issues. But, hiding someone else's property can be seen as wrong, even if it's for a good reason. The brother owns the Xbox, so taking that away without his consent might be an issue. However, the parents are involved and they're the ones who gave the task. But parents are usually the ones to enforce rules, not siblings. \n\nThe brother's behavior is problematic, so maybe the author's actions are a way to protect the family. But does that justify hiding the Xbox? Legally, the brother owns it, but in a family context, parents are supposed to manage their children's behavior. The author's parents might be delegating the task to their child, but it's the parents' responsibility. The author could be overstepping, even if the intention is good. Alternatively, they're helping a parent manage their child's addiction.\n\nOn one hand, the action is against the brother's wishes and property rights. On the other hand, it's to curb harmful behavior. The line between helping and interfering might be blurry here. The parents should be the ones handling their son's addiction, not the sibling. The author might be in a bad position, following their parents' orders but still causing conflict. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parents delegated the task, but A if taking someone's property is inherently wrong regardless. Hmm. Need to decide based on the situation. The parents are the ones who should be enforcing rules, so the author might not be at fault since they're acting under their parents' instruction. Also, the brother's actions are harmful, so the author is trying to help. So B.\n"
