Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The brother has a serious Fortnite addiction, which is affecting his behavior and schoolwork. The parents have set rules but the brother breaks them, sneaking in playtime. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox to prevent the brother from accessing it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author's actions are taken to help their brother, albeit through hiding his Xbox. The brother's addiction is problematic, leading to bad behavior and academic issues. The parents are struggling to enforce rules because the brother is resistant, even to the point of manipulating them into giving back the Xbox. The author is doing what the parents asked, so maybe they're not the one at fault here.\n\nBut wait, is the author overstepping by hiding the Xbox? The brother owns the console, so taking that away without his consent could be seen as taking away his property. However, the parents are the ones who gave the author the responsibility. The parents might be trying to protect him from himself, but the method is questionable. The author is acting as an enforcer of the parents' wishes. Since the parents are the ones who authorized the action, maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is a sibling, should they be involved in such a decision? The brother's addiction is a serious issue. The author might be trying to help, but is it fair to involve a sibling in enforcing such strict measures? The brother might feel betrayed, but the parents might see the author as necessary for discipline. It's a tough call. The key points are the parents' consent and the brother's problematic behavior. Since the parents told the author to do it, the author isn't acting independently. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
