Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The brother is in middle school, and the problem is his addiction, which is affecting his behavior, grades, and family dynamics. The parents allowed weekend playtime, but he sneaks it during weekdays. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox without informing them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' role. They set the rules, so if they asked the author to help enforce those rules, then the author is acting on their behalf. The brother is breaking the rules by playing on weekdays and has behavioral issues. The author's motivation is to protect the family environment and help the brother's well-being. Hiding the Xbox is a form of grounding or restricting access, which the parents seem to support. However, the brother bought the console himself, which might complicate things. But since he's a minor, the parents might manage it. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking it upon themselves without direct parental instruction, but they were told to do so. The brother's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions are meant to prevent worse outcomes. The key points are the parents' authority and the author's intent. If the parents sanctioned the action, then it's not the author's fault. The brother's addiction and behavior are the real issues here. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
