Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox because the brother is addicted to Fortnite. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother is in middle school, and he's playing over 10 hours on weekends and sneaking in weekday playtime. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, bad grades. The parents set rules but he breaks them, and when grounded, he nags until they give in. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox. The author is doing this even though the brother paid for the console.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The parents are the legal guardians and have the authority to set rules. They've asked the author to hide the Xbox to help control the brother's addiction. The author is acting under the parents' directive, so maybe that's not wrong. However, the brother owns the Xbox, so hiding it could be seen as taking something that's not yours. But the parents might have authority over the console as it's in their home, even if the brother paid for it. Also, the brother's behavior is problematic, and the parents are trying to intervene. The author's intention is to help the brother, not to be spiteful. \n\nOn the other hand, kids can't own property independently if they're minors. The parents likely have the final say on where things are kept in the house. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're following the parents' orders. The brother's addiction and bad behavior justify the action. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong. But some might argue the author is overstepping. However, given the parents' involvement, it's probably on the parents' behalf, so the author is not in the wrong.\n"
