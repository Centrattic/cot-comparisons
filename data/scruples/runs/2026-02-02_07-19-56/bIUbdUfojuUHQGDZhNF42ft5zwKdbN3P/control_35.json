Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves a middle schooler's Fortnite addiction leading to behavioral issues, poor grades, and conflict within the family. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The brother is addicted, which is causing problems at home. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, and the author is stepping in to help. The parents directly told the author to hide the Xbox, so there's some level of parental support for the action. \n\nHowever, the brother paid for the console. That might complicate things. The author is taking away something that belongs to their brother, even if the parents gave permission. But the parents might have the authority to decide how the console is used, especially since the brother is a minor. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' involvement and the brother's problematic behavior. The author's action is intended to help manage the addiction, which could be seen as a positive. But is it right for a sibling to take such action without direct parental instruction? Wait, the parents did tell them to hide it. So maybe the parents are complicit, and the author is acting under their guidance.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother's right to his own console could be an issue. But since he's a minor, his parents have authority over his possessions. The author's actions are in line with the parents' wishes to protect the brother from his addiction. \n\nThe author might be seen as helping the family situation rather than being in the wrong. The parents are the ones making the decision, and the author is following their lead. So the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong. \n\nBut I should also consider if there's a better way to handle it. Maybe the parents should handle the issue directly. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parents are involved and the action is to mitigate harm, the answer is likely B.\n"
