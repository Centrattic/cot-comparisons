Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox. The context is that the brother is addicted to Fortnite, playing over 10 hours a day on the weekend and even sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has gotten worse, with yelling, swearing, and poor grades. The parents tried to ground him, but he whines until they give in. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong to do this. Let me break it down. The author's intention is to help their brother by preventing excessive gaming. The brother's actions are clearly problematic\u2014addiction, bad behavior, poor grades. The parents are involved but seem to be struggling to enforce rules because the brother manipulates them. The author is following the parents' directive, so they might be acting as an enforcer.\n\nBut is it right for the author to hide the Xbox? Well, the brother owns the console, so hiding it without his consent could be seen as taking things too far. But the parents have given permission. The parents are the ones who set the rules, so if they instructed the author to do this, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, the brother is a minor, so the parents have authority here. The author is following their parents' orders, which in a family context, might be acceptable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have talked to the parents directly or found another solution instead of hiding the Xbox. But according to the situation, the parents already told them to do it. So the author's action is part of the parents' strategy. The brother's addiction is a serious issue, and the author's goal is to help. So it might not be the author's fault. The parents are the ones ultimately responsible for the rules. The author could be seen as a helper, not an antagonist. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
