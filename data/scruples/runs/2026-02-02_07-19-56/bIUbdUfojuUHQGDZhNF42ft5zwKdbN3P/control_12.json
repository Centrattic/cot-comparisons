Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves a middle school brother who's addicted to Fortnite, playing way too much and acting out. The parents set rules but he breaks them. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox because they trust them. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's behavior is bad\u2014playing 10+ hours on weekends, sneaking during the week, using profanity, poor grades. The parents are struggling to enforce rules, and when they do, the brother gets really aggressive. The parents then ask the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for hiding the Xbox? Well, the parents gave them permission to do it as a way to enforce the rules. The brother is paying for the console, but maybe the parents are the ones responsible for managing it since it's in their home. The author's intention is to help their parents and stop the brother's harmful behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is taking control without the brother's consent, which could be seen as underhanded. But given the brother's addiction and the parents' inability to manage it effectively, the author's actions might be necessary to protect their brother and family from his behavior. The parents are involved, so they support the action. \n\nI think the key points are that the parents authorized the action, the brother's behavior is problematic, and the author is trying to help. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
