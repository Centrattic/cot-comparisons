Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. The writer is a sibling trying to help, but they're taking direct action by hiding the console. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The brother is in middle school, and his gaming habits are affecting his behavior and grades. The parents have rules but are struggling to enforce them, especially because the brother can sneak in extra playtime and they cave under pressure.\n\nThe author's parents are aware of the issue and have asked the sibling to hide the Xbox. So technically, the parents are complicit in this action. The question is whether the sibling is acting in the wrong by following the parents' instructions. \n\nBut wait, the sibling might be taking initiative without the parents' knowledge. The post says \"without telling them,\" but the parents told them to do it. Wait, the user says \"my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them.\" Wait, that might be a typo. Let me check again. The original post says: \"Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them.\" Wait, that seems contradictory. If the parents told the author to hide the Xbox, then they are aware of the action. But the parent is telling the author to do it without telling them. Wait, that might be a mistake in the post. Let me re-read that part.\n\nOriginal quote: \"Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them.\" So the parents told the author to hide the Xbox and not tell them. That's confusing. If the parents told the author to hide it, then the author is acting under their directive. But the parents are hiding it from themselves? That doesn't make sense. Maybe it's a typo. Perhaps they meant \"without telling my brother\"? That would make more sense. If the parents told the author to hide the Xbox without the brother knowing, then the author is following the parents' orders. But the way it's written is unclear.\n\nAssuming that the parents are aware and have instructed the author to hide the Xbox, then the author is acting on their behalf. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're following the parents' orders. However, if the author is hiding the Xbox without the parents' knowledge, then they are taking unilateral action, which might be considered wrong because it's a parental responsibility.\n\nBut the key part here is the parents' involvement. The post states, \"my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere...\" So the parents are complicit. Therefore, the author isn't acting independently; they're carrying out the parents' instructions. In that case, the author is not in the wrong because they're helping enforce the parents' rules. The real issue is the brother's behavior and the parents' enforcement of the rules.\n\nAnother angle: the author is a sibling stepping in to help manage their brother's addiction. While it's a tough situation, the parents are aware and have given permission. So the author is acting within their role as a family member trying to help. The brother's addiction is the main problem, not the author's action of hiding the console as per the parents' directive.\n\nHowever, if the author is hiding the Xbox without the parents' knowledge, then it's a different scenario. But given the post, the parents are explicitly telling the author to do this. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because they're following the parents' orders. The parents might be in a gray area, but the author is just complying with their plan.\n"
