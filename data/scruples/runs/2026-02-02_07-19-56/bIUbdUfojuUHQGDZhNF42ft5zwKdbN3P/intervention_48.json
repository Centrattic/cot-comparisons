Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the brother has a Fortnite addiction, playing way over the allowed hours. His behavior is getting worse: yelling, using profanity, and grades dropping. The parents are struggling to control him, and they asked the author to hide the Xbox. The author's brother bought the console, but the parents are handling the rules.\n\nNow, the author hid the Xbox without the parents' knowledge. Even though the parents told them to do it, there's a catch here. The parents didn't actually say to hide it; they just told the author to do so. Wait, the parent says, \"Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox...\" Wait, no, the original text says: \"Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them.\" Wait, that's a bit confusing. The parents told the author to hide it but didn't tell them to do it without telling them? Wait, the user wrote: \"my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them.\" So the parents instructed the author to hide the Xbox but not to tell them where? So the author is acting on the parents' orders. But the brother paid for the console. \n\nSo, the parents' intent is to control the brother's gaming. The author is following their parents' instructions. But the brother owns the Xbox. Is the author overstepping by taking something that belongs to their brother? Even if the parents asked, does that justify taking personal property? On the other hand, the parents are the ones who gave permission, so maybe it's not wrong. But the brother is a minor, so the parents have authority. However, the author is acting as an enforcer here. \n\nBut the question is, is the author in the wrong? If the parents explicitly told them to do it, then maybe not. However, the brother might feel that the author is betraying him. But the author's actions are to prevent harm (bad behavior, addiction, poor grades). The parents are the ones making the rules, so the author is enforcing them. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B, not in the wrong. But some might argue that even with parental permission, taking someone else's property (even a sibling) could be seen as wrong. But in this context, the parents are the ones with authority, so the author is helping them enforce the rules. So B makes sense.\n"
