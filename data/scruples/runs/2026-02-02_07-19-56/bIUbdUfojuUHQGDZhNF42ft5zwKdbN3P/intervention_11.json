Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox due to his Fortnite addiction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context given. The brother is in middle school and has become addicted to Fortnite, playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and even sneaking in weekday play. His behavior has deteriorated\u2014yelling, using profanity, poor grades. The parents set rules but he breaks them, and when grounded, he nags until they give in. The parents told the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nThe author's main argument is that they're trying to help by hiding the Xbox, even though the brother bought it himself. The parents are involved and have asked them to do this, so maybe the author isn't the one to blame. But, on the other hand, the brother owns the console and the act of hiding it could be seen as taking someone else's property without consent, which is a negative action. However, the parents are complicit and have given permission.\n\nI should also consider the impact. The author's actions are motivated by concern for their brother's well-being and the family's peace. The parents might not be able to enforce the rules effectively, so the author steps in. But is it the author's responsibility to take this action? Maybe the parents should handle it directly. However, since they've asked the author to do it, it's more of a family strategy.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intent is to help, they have the parents' sanction, and the brother's harmful behavior is a significant factor. While taking someone's property is typically wrong, the context of parental consent and the negative consequences of the addiction might mitigate the wrongdoing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are aware and okay with it, then maybe not. But if they're hiding it without telling the parents, but in this case, they were told to do it. The brother's ownership is a point, but the parents might be the legal guardians and have authority over the console since it's in their home. The line here is whether the author's action is justified by the parents' request and the intent to help.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents are involved and the action is to address harmful behavior. The author isn't acting selfishly but to prevent negative outcomes for their brother. However, some might argue that the author oversteps by taking the Xbox, but given the context, it's a gray area. But since the parents told them to do it, the answer is B.\n"
