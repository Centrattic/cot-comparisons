Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about hiding their brother's Xbox because he's addicted to Fortnite. The brother is in middle school, playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaking playtime on weekdays. His behavior has gotten worse, with yelling, swearing, and poor grades. The parents have tried grounding him, but he nags them until they give in. Now the parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, the author's intention is to help the brother reduce gaming time, which seems to be a valid concern since excessive gaming can lead to negative effects like poor grades and bad behavior. However, the method they're using is hiding the Xbox. The brother owns the console, so taking it away without his knowledge might raise some issues. \n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to enforce the parents' rules and protect their brother from his addiction. The parents are involved and have given permission to hide the Xbox, so they share the responsibility. On the other hand, the author is taking a unilateral action without discussing it with the brother, which might infringe on the brother's ownership rights. But considering the brother's age and the addictive behavior, maybe the parents see this as a necessary step.\n\nThe question is whether hiding the Xbox is an appropriate method. While it's a form of intervention, it's done without open communication, which could lead to more resentment. However, given the brother's resistance and the parents' inability to manage it effectively, the author might be acting as a helper. But is it the right approach? Maybe there are other ways, like involving the parents more directly, counseling, or setting clearer consequences. Still, the author's actions are meant to help, not to be malicious. \n\nI think the answer depends on perspective. If the parents have already sanctioned this action, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, taking someone else's property without their consent could be seen as wrong. But given the context of addiction and parental involvement, perhaps it's justified. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I'm leaning towards B (No), but I'm a bit unsure because of the ownership issue.\n"
