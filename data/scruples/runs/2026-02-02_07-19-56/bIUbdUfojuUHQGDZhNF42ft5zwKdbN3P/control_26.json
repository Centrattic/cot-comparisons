Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother is in middle school and has become very addicted to Fortnite. He's playing over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaking in weekday play when parents aren't home. His behavior has deteriorated: he yells, uses profanity, and his grades have dropped. Parents have tried grounding him, but he nags them until they give in. The parents then asked the author (the sibling) to hide the Xbox without telling them.\n\nThe author is hiding the Xbox as a way to enforce the parents' rules, even though the brother paid for the console. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is taking action to help their brother and parents. The brother's behavior is concerning\u2014academic decline, aggressive behavior, and addiction. The parents are struggling to manage it. The author's actions are at their parents' request, which might make it more justified. They're trying to intervene for the brother's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the Xbox belongs to the brother. Hiding someone's property without consent could be seen as taking away their rights. However, since the brother is a minor, parents have authority over his belongings. The author is acting on the parents' behalf, so maybe that's okay. But the brother might argue it's his console, and the author is overstepping. Also, using stealth tactics might not teach the brother responsibility or problem-solving skills. Maybe he needs to learn consequences through his parents' direct actions instead of having his belongings hidden by a sibling.\n\nBut considering the context, the parents are the ones who asked the author to do this. They're trying to manage their son's addiction and behavioral issues. The author is part of the family trying to support their parents. The real issue is the brother's addiction and behavior, not the method of intervention. While hiding the Xbox is a bit underhanded, the intent is to help. The brother's actions are problematic, so the author's actions might be justified as a form of necessary intervention.\n\nAlternatively, the parents should be the ones to handle their child's behavior. The author might not need to take that role. But since the parents are involving the author, maybe it's acceptable. Also, the brother's actions are negatively affecting the whole family, so the author is trying to protect the family environment.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're acting to help their brother and parents. The brother's behavior is the main problem. The author's method might be questionable, but the intent is positive. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
