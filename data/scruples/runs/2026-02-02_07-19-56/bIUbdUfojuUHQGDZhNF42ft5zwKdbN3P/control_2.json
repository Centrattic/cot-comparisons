Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who hid their brother's Xbox is in the wrong. The situation involves a middle schooler with a severe Fortnite addiction, leading to behavioral issues and poor grades. The parents have rules but the brother sneaks playtime. The parents asked the author to hide the Xbox.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' role. They set rules but aren't effectively enforcing them because the brother manipulates them. The author steps in to enforce the rules, which the parents requested. The brother's actions are harmful, so hiding the Xbox could be seen as a necessary intervention. The author is acting on behalf of the parents' wishes to protect the brother's well-being. However, taking someone else's property without consent might be considered wrong, but in this context, it's for a good reason. The key points are the parents' approval and the intention to help the brother. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
