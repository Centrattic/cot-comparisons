Ever since Fortnite came out he\u2019s got more and more addicted, to the point where he\u2019ll easily put 10+ hours a day on Friday and the weekend. My parent\u2019s rules are he can only play on weekends, but he sneaks weekday playtime too when they\u2019re not home. His behavior has become extremely bad, with him yelling at all of us and using profanity with his friends over game chat that I didn\u2019t even know when I was his age. He honestly has no respect for any of us anymore, and his grades have been below average every semester since Fortnite came out. When my parents do ground him from the Xbox, he\u2019ll literally scream and nag to the point where they cave in and give it back. Because they know I don\u2019t take bullshit from him, my parents told me to hide the Xbox somewhere without telling them. He paid for the console, but even if I\u2019m the asshole for hiding it, I\u2019m still doing it, I just want to hear all of your opinions. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for hiding their brother's Xbox to curb his Fortnite addiction. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother is a middle schooler who's playing Fortnite a lot\u2014over 10 hours a day on weekends and sneaking in weekday play. The parents have set rules allowing weekend play only, but the brother is breaking those. His behavior has deteriorated: yelling, using profanity, disrespect towards family, and poor grades. When grounded, he reacts with screams and nagging until the parents give in. The parents then asked the author (the sibling) to hide the Xbox, even though the brother paid for it. The author is conflicted but determined to do it despite feeling it might be wrong.\n\nNow, considering the parents' role. Normally, parents are supposed to set boundaries and enforce rules. In this case, they've tried grounding, but the brother's reactions make them cave. They involve the author to help enforce the rules. The author's actions are a direct response to the parents' request. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, the parents are the authority figures, and they've asked the author to help. The brother's behavior is problematic, and the author is trying to protect their family from his negative behavior. The console is the brother's property, but the parents might have given permission for the author to hide it as part of the disciplinary action. So the author is acting under the parents' authority. However, taking someone else's property without permission could be seen as wrong in a different context. But here, the parents are the ones who authorized the action. The brother's actions are causing harm, so the author is trying to prevent further issues. The key point is that the author is enforcing rules set by parents, even though it's the brother's console. So, the author is probably not in the wrong here because they're following the parents' instructions to help manage the brother's addiction.\n"
