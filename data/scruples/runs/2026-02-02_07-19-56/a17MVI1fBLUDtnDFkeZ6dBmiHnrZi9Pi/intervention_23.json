If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The main issue here is the in-laws' behavior towards the daughter during birthdays, which has been causing her emotional distress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the story. The in-laws don't like the author, and their actions make the daughter feel unimportant. Examples given include not eating the cake the author made, leaving quickly, and a chaotic argument at the last birthday party. The daughter ends up crying every year because the in-laws' presence seems to ruin the celebration. The author is now considering not inviting them this year to prevent further hurt.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the right answer. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). To decide, I should evaluate whether the author is justified in excluding the in-laws for the daughter's well-being.\n\nThe in-laws' behavior is clearly problematic. They don't support the daughter's special day and their actions are hurtful. The daughter is emotionally affected each year. If the author believes inviting them will continue to cause pain, then not inviting them could be a protective measure. The parent's role is to prioritize their child's emotional health. Excluding relatives who consistently create a negative environment might be necessary, even if it's the \"traditional\" thing to do.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family should be included regardless. But given the specific circumstances where the in-laws' presence directly harms the daughter's experience, the author's decision seems reasonable. The daughter's emotional well-being is paramount. The author is trying to create a positive experience, and excluding harmful influences is a way to do that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to invite them.\n"
