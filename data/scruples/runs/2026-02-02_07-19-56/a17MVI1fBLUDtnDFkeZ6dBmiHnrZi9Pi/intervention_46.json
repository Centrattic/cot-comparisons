If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is about not inviting in-laws to their daughter's birthday party because the in-laws have a history of making the daughter feel unappreciated and causing chaos.\n\nFirst, the user says the in-laws don't like them and that their actions make the daughter feel bad. The in-laws don't eat the cake the author makes, leave quickly, and even caused a fight at the last party. The daughter ended up crying, and the in-laws' behavior seems to be a recurring issue. The author is now considering not inviting them again to prevent more hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might argue the opposite. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, family events often involve extended family, and excluding them might seem harsh. But in this case, the in-laws' behavior has a clear negative impact on the child. The daughter's emotional well-being is at stake. If the author believes the in-laws are the main cause of the daughter's distress, then not inviting them could be seen as a protective measure to ensure the daughter's birthday is positive.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have addressed the issue with the in-laws first, trying to communicate the impact of their actions. But the author mentions that the in-laws don't realize the harm they're causing, suggesting that past attempts to resolve this might have been unsuccessful. Also, the in-laws' behavior escalated into a public fight, which could justify the author's decision to cut them off to prevent further trauma.\n\nAnother point is the daughter's own feelings. She expressed not wanting a party because previous ones were ruined, so the author is trying to respect her wishes. The author's priority is their child's happiness, which is a strong point in their favor.\n\nIn terms of being wrong, if the in-laws' presence consistently leads to negative outcomes, the author isn't being unreasonable. They're making a choice to protect their child's emotional health. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
