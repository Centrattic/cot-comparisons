If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" post is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author states that their in-laws don't like them and their actions make the daughter feel unappreciated. The in-laws have a history of ruining the daughter's birthdays by leaving quickly, not eating the cake, and even causing a public confrontation last year. The daughter ends up crying each time. After the incident at the 13th birthday party, the daughter is now unsure if she wants a party because of the negative experiences. The author is considering not inviting the in-laws this year and wants to know if that's wrong.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. I need to analyze both sides. On one hand, in-laws are part of the family, and excluding them might seem harsh. However, the author argues that the in-laws' behavior is directly causing emotional harm to the daughter. The key points are the daughter's well-being and the in-laws' repeated negative actions.\n\nThe author's main concern is protecting their daughter's emotional health. If the in-laws are not making a positive contribution and are instead causing distress, then prioritizing the child's happiness makes sense. The author might not be in the wrong because they are acting in their daughter's best interest. Additionally, the in-laws' behavior seems to be the root of the problem, not the author's decision to exclude them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family gatherings, even if uncomfortable, are important for unity. But given the circumstances described\u2014public arguments, neglect during birthdays\u2014it's a different scenario. The author isn't cutting off the in-laws entirely but is making a choice to protect their child from further trauma. That seems justified.\n\nSo, considering the daughter's emotional well-being and the in-laws' consistent negative impact, the author isn't in the wrong for deciding to exclude them. The answer should be B (No).\n"
