If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether to invite in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The author has had multiple negative experiences where the in-laws have made their daughter upset on her birthdays. The in-laws don't like the author, and their actions make the daughter feel unimportant. The latest incident was a big blowout at a parade where the in-laws forgot about the party plans, leading to a confrontation and the daughter crying.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the in-laws again to prevent the daughter from being hurt. They think that since the in-laws are the cause of the daughter's negative feelings, it's okay to exclude them. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, family traditions might suggest including extended family in a child's life, especially if they're supposed to be part of the family. But on the other hand, the in-laws have a history of making the child feel unloved and causing emotional distress. The author's main goal is to protect the daughter's well-being. If the in-laws are not being supportive and are actively causing harm, then excluding them might be a reasonable decision. The daughter's emotional state is the priority here.\n\nThe key points are that the in-laws don't realize how their actions affect the child, but their behavior is still causing harm. The author has tried to explain and even the daughter is now hesitant to have a party. The author isn't excluding the in-laws to be mean, but to protect their child. In such cases, a parent's responsibility to their child's mental health might outweigh the obligation to include extended family, especially if those family members are not supportive. So, the author is not in the wrong for choosing to exclude the in-laws to prevent further emotional harm to the daughter. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
