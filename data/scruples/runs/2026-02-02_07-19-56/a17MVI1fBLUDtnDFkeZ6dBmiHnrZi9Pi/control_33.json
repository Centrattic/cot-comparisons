If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not inviting the in-laws to the daughter's birthday. The user is asking if they would be in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The user says the in-laws don't like them and their actions make the daughter feel bad. The daughter ends up crying because the in-laws don't engage with the birthday celebrations, like not eating the cake or leaving quickly. There was a major incident last year with a party that ended in chaos, leading the daughter to feel humiliated. Now, the daughter is hesitant to have a party because of past experiences.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the in-laws to prevent further hurt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that choice. \n\nFrom the description, the in-laws' behavior seems problematic. They contribute to the daughter's distress, even if unintentionally. The author is trying to protect their child from emotional harm. In terms of family dynamics, it's a common issue where boundaries are necessary for the child's well-being. \n\nLegally or ethically, inviting someone is a choice, and the author isn't obligated to include people whose presence causes harm. The key point is the impact on the child. If the in-laws' presence consistently ruins the birthday, then excluding them could be a reasonable decision. The author's priority is the daughter's happiness and mental health, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should be included regardless. But given the specific circumstances\u2014past negative experiences, the daughter's trauma\u2014it seems justified. The author isn't cutting off the in-laws entirely, just adjusting the event to protect the child. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author is acting in their daughter's best interest based on prior negative experiences. They're trying to prevent further emotional harm, which is a responsible parenting choice.\n"
