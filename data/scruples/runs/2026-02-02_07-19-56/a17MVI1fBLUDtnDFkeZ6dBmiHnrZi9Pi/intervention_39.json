If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The person is the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" question. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's in-laws don't like them, and their behavior is making their daughter feel unloved. Specifically, during birthdays, the in-laws avoid the cake and leave quickly, sometimes making excuses. Last year, there was a big public argument about the party plans, leading to the daughter being upset. The daughter now wants to skip a party because previous ones have been ruined by the in-laws. The author is considering not inviting them this year.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are the impact on the daughter's well-being and the family's behavior. The author has tried to mediate but the in-laws' actions are causing emotional harm. The author is trying to protect their daughter's happiness by excluding the in-laws. \n\nIn terms of parental rights, parents have the authority to make decisions for their children's well-being. If the in-laws' presence is consistently harmful, it's reasonable to exclude them. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to prevent further emotional damage. The in-laws' behavior, especially the public argument last year, seems to be the root cause. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be included, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the in-laws are the ones causing the problem, the author isn't at fault for taking steps to protect their child. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're acting in their daughter's best interest based on the in-laws' harmful behavior.\n"
