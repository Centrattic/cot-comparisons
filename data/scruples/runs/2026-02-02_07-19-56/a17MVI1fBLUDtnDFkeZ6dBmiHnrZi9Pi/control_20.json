If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The situation is that the in-laws don't like the author, and their behavior makes the daughter feel bad. The daughter has had bad experiences, like the in-laws leaving quickly during her birthday, using excuses to leave, and a big fight last year that ruined the party. The daughter now doesn't want a party because they always end up making her feel crummy.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not inviting the in-laws this year. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, not inviting family might seem like cutting them off, which could be seen as harsh. But the in-laws have a history of making the daughter feel unloved and causing emotional harm. The author's priority is their child's well-being. If the in-laws are consistently causing issues and the author believes it's for the child's best interest, then it's understandable. The key points here are the in-laws' behavior, the impact on the child, and the author's responsibility to protect their child's emotional health. \n\nThe author mentions that the daughter has been collateral damage multiple times, and the last incident was extremely traumatic. The daughter is now hesitant to have a party. The author's decision to exclude the in-laws is to prevent further emotional damage. In such cases, the parent's role is to protect their child, even if it means excluding family members who are harmful. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
