If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The key points here are the in-laws' behavior towards the daughter and the impact on her.\n\nFirst, the in-laws don't like the author, and their actions have been making the daughter feel unloved. The daughter's birthdays have been ruined multiple times because the in-laws leave early or ignore the celebration. The worst incident was the 13th birthday where a family argument in public made the daughter cry again. The daughter now doesn't want a party because it ends up being stressful.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the in-laws to prevent further harm. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nI need to consider if the author is justified in protecting their child from a toxic environment. The author's main goal is the daughter's well-being. Since the in-laws' presence consistently causes emotional distress, it's reasonable to exclude them to create a positive experience for the child. The author isn't ignoring the in-laws entirely but is prioritizing their child's emotional health. \n\nIn such cases, family dynamics can be complex, but the child's mental well-being is crucial. The author is trying to prevent further trauma, so they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
