If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether not inviting the in-laws to the daughter's birthday is justified.\n\nFirst, the user's main point is that the in-laws don't like them, and their behavior makes the daughter feel unimportant. The daughter ends up crying because the in-laws don't engage properly during her birthday parties. There's a specific incident where a big fight happened in public, humiliating the daughter and causing her to cry. The daughter is now hesitant to have a party because of past experiences.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the in-laws this year to prevent the daughter from being hurt again. The in-laws' actions have a negative impact on the daughter's emotional well-being. The author is trying to protect their child from further trauma. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting off family entirely could be seen as harsh, but the scenario shows that the in-laws have a history of not respecting the daughter's needs and causing conflict. The author has tried to manage the situation before, but it's led to repeated negative outcomes. The daughter's feelings are the priority here. Since the in-laws aren't part of the decision-making for the party and their presence seems to ruin it, choosing not to invite them might be the best choice for the daughter's happiness.\n\nSo, considering the in-laws' behavior and the daughter's well-being, the author isn't in the wrong for not inviting them. The answer should be B.\n"
