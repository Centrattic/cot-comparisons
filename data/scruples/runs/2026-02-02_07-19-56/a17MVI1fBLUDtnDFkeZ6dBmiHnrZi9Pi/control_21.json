If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether to invite in-laws to the daughter's birthday. The user's in-laws don't like them and their behavior makes the daughter feel unappreciated, especially on her birthday. The key points are the in-laws not eating the cake, leaving quickly, and the previous year's party turning into a disaster with yelling and threats, ruining the daughter's special day. The daughter now is unsure about having a party because of past experiences.\n\nSo the author is considering not inviting the in-laws again to prevent further hurt. The question is if they're in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The in-laws' actions are causing emotional harm to the child. The parents are trying to protect their daughter's well-being. If the in-laws' presence consistently ruins the birthday, then excluding them might be a necessary step. The author isn't ignoring the in-laws in general but is specifically trying to protect their child from negative experiences. \n\nThe parents have tried to manage the situation before, but the in-laws' behavior has been so bad that it's affecting the child's emotional state. The previous incident was a public outburst, which is unprofessional and harmful. The author's decision to not invite them is to prevent further trauma to the daughter. \n\nIn such cases, family traditions can be tough, but the child's mental health is a priority. The parents are the ones responsible for the child's upbringing and environment. If the in-laws are unwilling to change their behavior to support the child, the parents have the right to set boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their child's well-being over including the in-laws. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
