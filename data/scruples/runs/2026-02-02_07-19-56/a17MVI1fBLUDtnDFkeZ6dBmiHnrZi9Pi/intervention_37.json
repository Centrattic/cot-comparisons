If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The situation they described is that the in-laws don't like them and their behavior makes the daughter feel unimportant on her birthday. The author is considering not inviting them this year to prevent the daughter's distress.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is whether the author's decision is justified given the in-laws' past behavior. The in-laws have a history of making the daughter upset by leaving quickly, not engaging with the birthday, and causing a major conflict last year. The author is trying to protect the daughter's emotional well-being by excluding the in-laws.\n\nI should consider the child's best interests. Parents often make decisions based on what they believe is best for their children, even if it means cutting off other family members. The in-laws' actions have repeatedly harmed the daughter's experience of her birthdays, leading to her losing interest in having parties. The author is trying to prevent further trauma.\n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that the author should try to reconcile or include the in-laws, but given the in-laws' history of not respecting the daughter's feelings and the recent conflict, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their daughter's happiness. The author isn't cutting off the in-laws out of spite but to protect their child from negative experiences.\n\nSo, the author's decision seems to be in the daughter's best interest. They are acting to prevent further harm, which is a parent's responsibility. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
