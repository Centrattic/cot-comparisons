If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's wrong not to invite the in-laws to the daughter's birthday. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides.\n\nFirst, the context: The in-laws don't like the author, and their behavior is making the daughter feel unloved. The daughter has had bad experiences at her birthdays with the in-laws not participating (like refusing to eat the cake, leaving quickly) and a major incident last year where the party fell apart, causing her to cry. The daughter now is unsure if she wants a party at all because of these experiences.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the in-laws this year to prevent the daughter from being hurt again. The user thinks the author is wrong, but maybe they're not. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one side, family traditions and inclusion are important. Not inviting in-laws could be seen as cutting them off, especially if they are part of the family. But on the other hand, the in-laws have consistently made the daughter feel bad, which is a serious issue. The daughter's well-being and emotional health are at stake here. If the in-laws' presence is causing trauma, maybe it's right to exclude them to protect the child.\n\nThe key points are the repeated negative impact on the daughter and the lack of positive contribution from the in-laws. The author isn't trying to exclude for personal reasons but to protect the child. The in-laws don't seem to realize how their actions affect the daughter, and their behavior has led to significant emotional harm. The author has tried to include them but it keeps ending in disaster.\n\nSo, considering the daughter's happiness and mental health, it's reasonable for the author to decide not to invite the in-laws this time. The author is acting in the child's best interest, which seems more important than maintaining family ties that are harmful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
