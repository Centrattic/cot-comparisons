If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author describes that the in-laws don't like them and their actions make the daughter feel unappreciated. The daughter ends up crying because the in-laws don't engage properly during birthdays. Last year's incident was a big blowout in public, leading to the daughter being upset. Now, the daughter is hesitant to have a party because of past negative experiences. The author is considering excluding the in-laws to prevent further harm.\n\nThe key points here are the in-laws' behavior affecting the child's emotional well-being and the parents' effort to protect their daughter. The main question is whether excluding the in-laws is justified.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, the primary responsibility is the child's well-being. If extended family members are consistently causing distress without being aware or caring, the parents might need to make tough decisions. The author seems to have tried to include them in the past but faced repeated issues. The daughter's emotional state is a major factor here.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of family dynamics. Excluding relatives could be seen as cutting them off, but if they are contributing to the child's unhappiness, it might be necessary. The author isn't claiming malice from the in-laws, just that they don't realize the impact of their actions. The daughter has been collateral damage multiple times, so the parents are trying to protect her.\n\nI think the author is justified. Their actions are to safeguard their daughter's emotional health. The in-laws' behavior has been problematic, and the parents are acting in the child's best interest. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the in-laws are the ones causing the issues, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
