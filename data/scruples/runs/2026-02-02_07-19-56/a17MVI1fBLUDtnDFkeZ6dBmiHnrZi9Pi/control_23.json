If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The situation is that the in-laws don't like the author and their behavior negatively affects the daughter. The daughter's birthdays have been ruined in the past because the in-laws leave quickly or act indifferent. Last year's party ended in chaos with arguments and screaming, and the daughter was upset. Now, the author is considering not inviting them again to prevent more harm.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The key points here are the well-being of the daughter and the behavior of the in-laws. The in-laws' actions have repeatedly caused emotional distress to the daughter, even to the point of her crying and feeling unloved on her birthday. The author has tried to reason with them but hasn't seen improvement. The last incident was particularly bad, leading to a public argument and further trauma for the daughter. \n\nThe author's main goal is to protect their daughter's emotional health. If inviting the in-laws continues to cause harm, then it's reasonable for the author to exclude them. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong by doing so. Since the in-laws are the ones causing the problem, the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to prevent further harm. The author isn't cutting off the in-laws without cause; there's a documented pattern of negative behavior affecting the child. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family gatherings are important and that the author should make an effort to include them. But in this case, the in-laws aren't cooperating or showing the necessary respect for the daughter's feelings. The author has a responsibility to prioritize their daughter's well-being. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting in their child's best interest.\n"
