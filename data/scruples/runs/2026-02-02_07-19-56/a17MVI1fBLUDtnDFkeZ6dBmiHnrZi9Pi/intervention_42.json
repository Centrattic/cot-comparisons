If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The situation seems complicated. The in-laws don't like the author, and their behavior has been negatively affecting the daughter's birthday experiences. The key points here are the daughter's emotional well-being and the in-laws' actions.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the in-laws don't like them and that their actions make the daughter feel unimportant. The examples given, like refusing to eat the cake she made and leaving quickly, are hurtful to a child. The previous year's party ended in chaos with screaming and threats, which clearly traumatized the daughter. The daughter now feels hesitant to have a party because of past experiences. \n\nThe author is considering excluding the in-laws to prevent further harm. The question is whether this decision makes them wrong. On one hand, family gatherings are often seen as important, but in this case, the in-laws' presence is causing emotional damage. The parent's primary concern is their child's well-being. If the in-laws are unwilling to support the child's milestones in a positive way, it might be reasonable to exclude them to protect the child's happiness.\n\nHowever, some might argue that cutting off family entirely could have its own repercussions, like straining the marriage if the husband wants to maintain a relationship with his parents. But the author's main argument is that the in-laws' behavior is specifically targeting the daughter's emotional state, which is a significant factor. The daughter's mental health and positive experiences should be a priority. \n\nGiven the context, it seems the author's decision to exclude the in-laws is a protective measure rather than a selfish one. The in-laws' actions are the root cause of the daughter's distress. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to invite them to protect their child's well-being.\n"
