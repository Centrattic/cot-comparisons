If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The situation is that the in-laws don't like the author and their behavior has been making the daughter cry on her birthday. The author feels that the in-laws don't realize how their actions affect the daughter, but the daughter ends up feeling unloved because the in-laws leave early, avoid eating the cake, etc. There was a big argument last year at the party which ruined the day for the daughter. Now, the daughter is hesitant to have a party again because of the trauma.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to exclude the in-laws this time. So, I need to determine if the author's decision is justified.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is the well-being of their daughter. The in-laws' presence has consistently led to negative experiences for the daughter. The author tried to include them but it resulted in chaos, with the in-laws not respecting the daughter's special day. The daughter's emotional state is the priority here. The author is trying to protect her from further harm.\n\nFamily dynamics can be complicated. However, in this case, the in-laws' behavior has been harmful. The author isn't cutting off the in-laws out of spite but to prevent the daughter from being hurt. The daughter's happiness and mental health are at stake. The author's decision seems to be an act of love and protection.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not inviting family could be seen as excluding them, but given the context, it's more about preventing negative outcomes. The author has tried to involve the in-laws before but it didn't work. The daughter has requested not to have parties anymore because of the in-laws, so this decision is also respecting the daughter's wishes.\n\nThere's no indication that the author is being vindictive. They even tried to make the daughter be the bigger person before, which backfired. Now, they're making a proactive choice to protect her. So, the author is not in the wrong here because their actions are aimed at safeguarding their child's emotional well-being, which is a parent's primary responsibility.\n"
