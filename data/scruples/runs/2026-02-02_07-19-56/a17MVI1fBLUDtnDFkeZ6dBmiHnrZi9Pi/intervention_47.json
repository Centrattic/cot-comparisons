If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post) is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The author describes a history of the in-laws making their daughter feel unimportant on her birthday, leading to emotional distress. The key points are:\n\n1. The in-laws don't like the author, which leads them to make the daughter feel bad, possibly unintentionally.\n2. Past birthday incidents include the in-laws leaving abruptly, not engaging with the daughter's cake, and a major conflict at the 13th birthday party causing the daughter to cry.\n3. The daughter is now hesitant to have parties because they end poorly.\n4. The author is considering excluding the in-laws to prevent further harm.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if not inviting the in-laws is justified. The author's main concern is the daughter's emotional well-being. If the in-laws' presence consistently leads to negative experiences for the child, it might be in the child's best interest to exclude them. However, family dynamics can be complex. The author might be seen as cutting off family without addressing the issue first, but if previous attempts to resolve the problem (like discussing with the husband) failed, then exclusion could be a protective measure.\n\nAnother angle: The daughter's psychological well-being is crucial. Parents have a duty to protect their children from harmful situations. If the in-laws' behavior is detrimental, even if unintentional, excluding them could be necessary. The author isn't just being petty; they're trying to prevent repeated trauma.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that family relationships are important and that the author should work on improving relations instead of avoiding them. But given the described incidents, it's clear there's a pattern of harmful behavior that hasn't improved over time. The daughter's explicit statement about not wanting parties because they end poorly suggests that the author's decision is based on the child's expressed needs.\n\nTherefore, considering the child's well-being and the documented negative impact of the in-laws, the author's decision seems justified. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
