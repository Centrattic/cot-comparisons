If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The situation is that the in-laws don't like them, and their behavior has been making the daughter upset. The author is concerned because the in-laws' actions, like refusing to eat the cake and leaving the party early, have led to the daughter feeling unloved and crying. The last incident involved a big fight in public, which ruined the birthday again. Now, the author is considering not inviting them again to prevent the daughter from getting hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The in-laws' dislike and their actions that inadvertently hurt the child. The author tried to include them before, but it ended in disaster. The daughter is now reluctant to have a party because of these past experiences. The author's main argument is that they want to protect their child's emotional well-being by excluding the in-laws.\n\nOn one hand, family involvement in a child's life is often considered important. But in this case, the in-laws' presence seems to consistently lead to negative experiences. The author mentions that the in-laws might not be doing it on purpose but their actions are still harmful. The daughter's feelings and the traumatic events at previous parties are significant factors. The author also tried to have the daughter be the bigger person, which backfired, leading to further hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting out family, even if they're not perfect, could have its own consequences. However, the in-laws here are not just difficult but have created a hostile environment. The fact that the daughter is now doubting the value of a party suggests that the negative impact is real and lasting. The author's decision to protect their child from this seems reasonable, especially if the in-laws don't recognize or change their harmful behavior.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their priority is their daughter's happiness and well-being. If the in-laws are causing consistent emotional harm without realizing it, the parent has a right to make decisions to shield their child. It's about creating a safe and positive environment for the child. The previous attempts to involve the in-laws resulted in harm, so avoiding that seems justified. The answer should be B for No.\n"
