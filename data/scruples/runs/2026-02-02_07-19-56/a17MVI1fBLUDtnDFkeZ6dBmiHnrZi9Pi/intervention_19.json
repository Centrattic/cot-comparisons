If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details straight.\n\nThe author mentions that their in-laws don't like them, and as a result, they do things that make their daughter feel bad. The main issue is the daughter's birthday. The in-laws have a history of not engaging in the celebrations\u2014like refusing to eat the cake the author makes and leaving quickly, even using excuses like the wind. This has led the daughter to feel unloved and upset, crying because she thinks no one cares. \n\nLast year's birthday party was especially bad. They had planned the party at the in-laws' backyard, but the in-laws forgot the plan, leading to a public argument and outbursts. The daughter ended up crying again, and the author convinced her to accept presents from the in-laws, which the daughter later regretted. Now, the daughter is hesitant to have a party because of past experiences, and the author is considering not inviting the in-laws again.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong for this decision. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author's primary concern is their daughter's emotional well-being. The in-laws' actions have consistently made the daughter feel neglected and upset. The author has tried to mediate and even convinced the daughter to accept gifts, but the in-laws' behavior seems to be a recurring problem.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong to exclude the in-laws this time. From a parent's perspective, protecting a child from negative influences is often seen as a duty. If the in-laws' presence consistently leads to the child feeling bad, then excluding them could be a protective measure. The author has already tried to address the issue, but the in-laws haven't changed their behavior. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should be included, and that the author should try to resolve the conflict with the in-laws instead of excluding them. But the author states that they don't think the in-laws are acting purposefully but rather not realizing the impact of their actions. If the in-laws aren't malicious but still don't change, the author might feel justified in protecting their daughter.\n\nAnother point is that the daughter herself has expressed not wanting a party because of past experiences, which suggests that the author is heeding her child's feelings. Excluding the in-laws would prevent potential trauma for the daughter. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes extended family is expected at such events, but the author's priority is their daughter's happiness. If the in-laws' presence is causing harm, then the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to exclude them. The author has a right to protect their child from a toxic environment, even if it means not inviting certain relatives. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
