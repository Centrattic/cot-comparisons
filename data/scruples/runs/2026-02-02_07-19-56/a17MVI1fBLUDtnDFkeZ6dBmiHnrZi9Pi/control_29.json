If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The situation is that the in-laws don't like the author, and their behavior makes the daughter feel unappreciated. The daughter's birthdays have been repeatedly ruined by the in-laws leaving early, not engaging with the cake, and even causing a public argument. Last year's incident was especially traumatic, leading the daughter to be upset and not want to celebrate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is protecting their daughter from a family environment that consistently causes her emotional distress. The in-laws' actions, even if not intentional, are clearly harmful. The daughter's well-being seems to be the main concern here. The author's decision to exclude the in-laws is to prevent further trauma and ensure the birthday is positive for the child.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting off family entirely could have its own issues, like the daughter not seeing her relatives. But the author mentions that the daughter has already been hurt repeatedly, and the in-laws don't realize the impact. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing the daughter's emotional health over including problematic relatives.\n\nI think the key is the impact on the daughter. If the in-laws' presence consistently causes harm, then the author is acting in their child's best interest. There's no indication that the author is being vindictive; they even tried to manage the situation before. The answer likely leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because protecting a child from a harmful environment is a valid and responsible action.\n"
