If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not inviting in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The author explains that the in-laws don't like them and their behavior negatively affects the daughter's birthday celebrations. The key points are that the in-laws don't seem to care about the daughter's birthday, leading to her feeling unappreciated and upset. Last year's party ended in chaos with arguments and public humiliation, making the daughter cry.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the in-laws this year to prevent the daughter from feeling bad again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The in-laws' actions are causing emotional harm to the daughter. The author has tried to mediate and even taught the daughter to be the bigger person, but the problem persists. The author's decision to exclude the in-laws is to protect the child's emotional well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a parent, you should involve extended family if the other parent (the husband) is still okay with it. The husband is part of the equation here. However, the in-laws' behavior seems to be consistently harmful. The author mentions that the in-laws don't realize how their actions affect the child, but their actions are still causing pain. \n\nThe main conflict is between the author's desire to protect their daughter and the in-laws' presence, which they feel is detrimental. If the in-laws are not contributing positively and are instead causing stress and emotional damage, then excluding them could be seen as a protective measure. \n\nAlso, the daughter has expressed a desire not to have a party because of past experiences, which adds weight to the author's decision. The author's primary responsibility is to their child's well-being, so prioritizing that by excluding harmful influences might be justified. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of family relationships. However, the in-laws' behavior is not just passive neglect; they've been actively involved in creating a hostile environment during a celebration meant to be joyful. The author has tried to include them but hasn't seen improvement. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision seems to be a reasonable response to protect their child from ongoing harm. So, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
