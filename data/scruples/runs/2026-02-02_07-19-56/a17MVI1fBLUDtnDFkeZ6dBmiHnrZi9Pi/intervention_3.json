If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is considering not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The in-laws apparently don't like the author and their behavior makes the daughter feel bad. The key points are that the in-laws have a history of ruining the daughter's birthdays by not engaging properly, leading to the daughter feeling unappreciated. There was a major blowout at last year's party, with screaming, threats, and the daughter ending up upset. The author wants to skip the in-laws this year to prevent further trauma.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by deciding not to invite the in-laws. Let's think about the factors. Family dynamics can be really complex. On one hand, the author has a responsibility to protect their child's well-being. If the in-laws consistently cause emotional harm to the daughter, it's reasonable for the author to take steps to prevent that. The daughter's emotional health seems to be the main concern here. The author has tried to mediate before, even making the daughter be the bigger person, which she regretted. Now the daughter is losing enthusiasm for her own birthdays because of the in-laws' behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be included in such events, especially if the in-laws are part of the broader family structure. However, the in-laws in this case aren't just passive observers; their actions are actively harmful. The author is prioritizing the child's feelings over potential family expectations, which could be seen as the right choice. The in-laws' behavior is not just occasional but has a pattern that's been problematic for years. The author has tried to address it before, but the in-laws either don't change or their actions are unintentionally harmful without realizing the impact.\n\nAnother angle is the legal or social expectations. There's no legal obligation to invite family members to private events. Socially, it's often considered a good idea to include extended family, but if including them causes more harm than good, especially to a child, that's a strong argument for exclusion. The author is making a decision to protect their child from emotional distress, which is a parent's primary responsibility.\n\nSo, considering the harm caused by the in-laws and the child's well-being, the author's decision seems justified. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting in their child's best interest to prevent further emotional harm.\n"
