If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The scenario given is that the in-laws don't like the author, and their behavior makes the daughter feel bad during her birthdays. The in-laws have a history of making the daughter's birthdays unpleasant, like refusing to eat the cake she made or leaving abruptly. The worst incident was when the MIL forgot the party, leading to a public argument and the daughter feeling humiliated.\n\nThe author is considering not inviting the in-laws this year to prevent the daughter from feeling hurt again. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are the impact on the daughter's well-being. The in-laws' actions have consistently caused emotional distress to the child. Parents have a right to protect their children from harmful situations. If the in-laws' presence is causing trauma, then the author's decision might be justified.\n\nBut some might argue that in-laws have a right to be involved, especially with grandchildren. However, the author mentions that the in-laws don't like them, leading to their negative behavior. The daughter's emotional health is a significant factor here. The author wants to prevent future pain, so not inviting them could be seen as a protective measure.\n\nIn terms of social norms, usually, families include extended family in children's events. But exceptions can be made if there's a history of conflict or abuse. The line between normal disagreements and harmful behavior matters. Here, the in-laws' actions have clearly affected the child negatively, so prioritizing the child's well-being over including the in-laws makes sense.\n\nSo the author is not in the wrong because they're acting in their daughter's best interest to avoid repeated trauma. The answer should be B.\n"
