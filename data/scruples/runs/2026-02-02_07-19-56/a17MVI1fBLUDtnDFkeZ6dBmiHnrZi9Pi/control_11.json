If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The answer should be either A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that their in-laws don't like them, and because of that, they do things that make the daughter feel bad. The main issue is the in-laws not engaging during the birthday parties. For example, they refuse to eat the cake the author made, leave quickly, and once used a parade as an excuse to skip the party. The daughter ends up crying because she feels unloved. Last year's 13th birthday party led to a public argument and SIL threatening the husband, which further upset the daughter. Now, the daughter is hesitant to have a party again because of the past experiences. The author is considering not inviting the in-laws to prevent more hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by excluding the in-laws. Let's break it down. The key points are the in-laws' behavior affecting the child's emotions, previous incidents of neglect and public conflict, and the author's intention to protect the daughter's feelings.\n\nFrom a general perspective, family events like a child's birthday are important for the child. However, if the in-laws consistently act in ways that harm the child's well-being, the author has a responsibility to prioritize the child's emotional health. The in-laws' actions are being described as unintentional but still hurtful. The author also mentions that the daughter is now reluctant to have a party because of the in-laws' past behavior. \n\nThe main ethical consideration here is the child's best interest. Parents are typically the ones responsible for making decisions that protect their children's well-being. If the in-laws are causing distress, it's reasonable for the author to take steps to prevent that. The argument in the past that led to threats and screaming would likely create an uncomfortable environment for the child. The author's intention is to avoid further emotional trauma, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, some might argue that cutting off family, even if they're problematic, could have consequences. But the author isn't cutting off the in-laws entirely; they just want to exclude them from the birthday event. The daughter's happiness is the priority here, and if the in-laws' presence consistently undermines that, the author's choice isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nAlso, the author has tried to salvage the situation in the past, like convincing the daughter to be the bigger person, which didn't work. This shows they've made efforts to maintain family relations but have seen that it's not effective. The daughter's statement about not wanting a party because it always ends badly indicates that the in-laws are the root cause. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the in-laws are at fault for their behavior, not the author for trying to protect their child. The author isn't obligated to include people who make the child unhappy, especially if it's within their control to change the environment. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not inviting them this year to prevent more harm.\n"
