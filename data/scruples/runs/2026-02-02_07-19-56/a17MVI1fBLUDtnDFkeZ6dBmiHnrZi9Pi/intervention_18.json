If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author mentions that their in-laws don't like them, and this leads to the in-laws doing things that make their daughter feel bad. Specifically, during the daughter's birthdays, the in-laws either avoid celebrating the cake because the author made it or leave quickly. The worst incident was when the daughter turned 13 and there was a big fight between the in-laws and the husband, leading to the daughter crying and feeling upset. Now, the daughter is hesitant to have a birthday party because of past experiences.\n\nThe author is asking if they would be at fault (WIBTA) if they didn't invite the in-laws this year. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The main issue is the well-being of the daughter. The in-laws' actions (whether intentional or not) are causing emotional harm to the child during her birthdays. The author is trying to protect her from further distress by excluding the in-laws. From a child's perspective, birthdays are important, and seeing family members act dismissively or cause conflict can be very hurtful.\n\nThe in-laws' behavior seems problematic. The fact that they don't want to eat the cake the author made and leave immediately could be seen as undermining the event. The incident at the 13th birthday party was a major breakdown, with screaming, threats, and public humiliation. This kind of environment is definitely not what a child should experience on a special day. The author's husband tried to address it, but the in-laws' response was aggressive and inappropriate.\n\nThe author tried to convince the daughter to accept gifts afterward, which the daughter resisted. The child ended up feeling like she shouldn't stand up for herself, which could have lasting negative effects. The author is now considering not inviting the in-laws to prevent future pain.\n\nNow, the dilemma is whether excluding the in-laws is the right move. On one hand, family is important, and excluding them might be seen as cutting off a part of the family. On the other hand, the in-laws' behavior has a clear negative impact on the child. The parent's role is to protect the child's emotional health. If the in-laws are unable or unwilling to participate positively in the child's life, perhaps the right decision is to exclude them.\n\nThe in-laws might argue that they want to be part of the child's life, but their actions don't align with that desire. The author has tried to communicate and even made plans, only for the in-laws to forget or act inappropriately. The daughter's feelings are the priority here. If the in-laws can't adjust their behavior to support the child, then the parent is justified in making changes to protect the child.\n\nAnother angle is the parent's responsibility to create a positive environment for the birthday. If including the in-laws consistently leads to conflict and pain, it's responsible to exclude them. It's a difficult situation because it involves extended family, but the child's emotional well-being takes precedence.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground, like having separate events or inviting the in-laws under different circumstances where they can participate without causing conflict. However, given the history of the in-laws' behavior, it's possible that any interaction might still lead to the same negative outcomes. The daughter has already expressed a desire not to have a party because of past experiences, so the author is trying to make the event positive for her.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is trying to protect their daughter from repeated emotional harm caused by the in-laws. While it's a tough decision to exclude family, the priority is the child's well-being. The in-laws' actions, whether intentional or not, have repeatedly ruined the daughter's birthday. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for choosing not to invite the in-laws to protect their child's feelings and create a better experience for her.\n"
