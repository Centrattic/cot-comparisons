If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that their in-laws don't like them and their actions make the daughter feel bad. The main issue is around birthdays where the in-laws don't engage, like refusing to eat the cake the author made or leaving quickly. There was a specific incident last year where the in-laws forgot the party plans, leading to a big fight in public, which upset the daughter. Now, the daughter doesn't want a party because they always end badly, and the author is considering not inviting the in-laws again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for deciding not to invite the in-laws this year. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The in-laws' behavior seems to consistently hurt the daughter's feelings. The author has tried to make the birthday special, but the in-laws' actions (deliberate or not) ruin it. The public incident last year was a turning point, making the daughter cry and feel humiliated. The author is trying to protect the daughter from further emotional harm.\n\nIn terms of ethics, families often have complex dynamics. The author is prioritizing their child's well-being over family obligations. If the in-laws are causing harm, it's reasonable to exclude them to prevent further negative experiences. The author isn't cutting off all contact but is making a choice to avoid a specific event where the in-laws' presence has been detrimental.\n\nHowever, some might argue that excluding family could be seen as being inconsiderate or causing further family tension. But given the history of the in-laws' behavior affecting a child's well-being, the primary responsibility is to protect the child. The author isn't doing anything to provoke the in-laws; they're reacting to past behavior that's been harmful.\n\nAlso, the daughter has expressed not wanting a party because of previous experiences. The author is respecting her feelings and trying to create a positive environment. The fact that the in-laws didn't remember plans and caused a public scene shows a lack of consideration. The author's decision seems justified as a way to prevent ongoing emotional damage.\n\nI don't see any indication that the author is being unreasonable. They've tried to include the in-laws but their actions keep undermining the celebrations. The author is making a choice to protect their child, which is a parent's duty. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
