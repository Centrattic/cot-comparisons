If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. So the situation is that the in-laws don't like the author, and their behavior makes the daughter feel unappreciated during her birthday. The daughter ends up crying because the in-laws don't engage in the celebration, and there was a big fight last year which ruined the party. Now, the author is considering not inviting them this year to prevent more pain for the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's main concern is their daughter's emotional well-being. The in-laws' actions have consistently made the daughter feel unloved and neglected during her birthdays. The author is trying to protect their child from further hurt. On the other hand, not inviting in-laws might be seen as cutting them off, but if the in-laws are causing harm, maybe it's justified.\n\nIn terms of social norms, typically, in-laws might be included in family events, especially for children. However, if the in-laws are known to cause issues, some might argue that the family has the right to exclude them to protect their child. The key here is whether the author's decision is in the best interest of their daughter.\n\nThe author mentions that the in-laws' behavior is unintentional but still harmful. The daughter's trauma from previous birthdays is significant. If the author believes that not inviting the in-laws would prevent the daughter from feeling hurt again, then it's a protective measure. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to create a positive experience for their child.\n\nAnother angle is the relationship between the author and the in-laws. The author states that the in-laws don't like them, which might mean that the in-laws aren't a positive presence. If the in-laws are not supportive, then excluding them could be reasonable. The author isn't obligated to include people who are harmful to their family.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have the party without the in-laws and find another time for a less formal get-together. But given the past experiences, the author's priority is the daughter's happiness, so excluding the in-laws seems justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's primary responsibility is to their daughter's well-being. The in-laws' behavior has repeatedly caused emotional distress. The decision to exclude them this year is a way to ensure the birthday is positive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
