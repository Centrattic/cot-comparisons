If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The author's main argument is that the in-laws don't like them and their behavior makes the daughter feel unappreciated, especially around her birthday. They mention past incidents where the in-laws left quickly, didn't eat the cake, and even caused a public argument, leading the daughter to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. Parents generally want to protect their children from negative experiences. If the in-laws' actions are consistently harming the daughter's emotional well-being, then the author might be justified in cutting them off. The key points are the in-laws' behavior affecting the child negatively and the author's efforts to prevent further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family relationships should be maintained, even if they're difficult. However, the author has tried to explain that they've attempted to manage the situation before, but it's led to more problems. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their child's well-being over maintaining a strained family relationship.\n\nI should also think about cultural or social norms. In some cases, including extended family in a child's life is considered important. But if the in-laws are actively causing distress, that might not apply. The author is trying to protect their child from repeated trauma, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's decision is a reasonable response to protect their child. Since the in-laws' behavior is the root cause of the daughter's negative experiences, the author isn't in the wrong for excluding them to prevent further harm. So the correct answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
