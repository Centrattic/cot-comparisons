If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not inviting in-laws to the daughter's birthday party. The author explains that the in-laws don't like them and their actions have been making the daughter feel unappreciated, especially on birthdays. The last party was a disaster, leading to the daughter being upset, and the author is considering not inviting them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the in-laws' behavior is causing emotional harm to their daughter. The in-laws don't eat the cake, leave quickly, and there was a major conflict at the last party. The daughter is now hesitant to have a party because of these experiences. The author is asking if they would be wrong (WIBTA) for not inviting the in-laws this time.\n\nTraditional social norms might suggest that inviting close family is expected, especially for a child's birthday. However, the author is prioritizing the daughter's emotional well-being. There's a conflict between maintaining family obligations and protecting the child from negative experiences. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the in-laws' presence is causing harm, and they believe the in-laws aren't aware of their impact. The daughter has been left upset multiple times, and the last incident was particularly traumatic. The author is trying to prevent future harm by excluding the in-laws. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, protecting a child from emotional distress is a strong consideration. The author is taking responsibility for the child's well-being, even if it means going against family expectations. The in-laws' behavior seems to be the root cause here, not the author's decision to exclude them. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have addressed the issue earlier or tried to mediate the in-laws' behavior. But given the repeated incidents and the lack of improvement, it's reasonable to conclude that the author has made a decision to prioritize their daughter's happiness. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. They are acting in their child's best interest after multiple negative experiences with the in-laws.\n"
