If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The author explains that the in-laws don't like them and their actions make the daughter feel unappreciated. The in-laws have a history of ruining the birthday parties by leaving early, not eating the cake, and causing a scene.\n\nThe author's main concern is protecting their daughter from further emotional harm. The last birthday party led to a chaotic confrontation, and the daughter ended up upset. Now, the daughter is hesitant to have a party at all. The author is considering excluding the in-laws to prevent this from happening again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from different angles. On one hand, family traditions and inclusion are important, but the author is prioritizing their daughter's well-being. The in-laws' behavior seems to be a recurring issue, and they don't seem to realize how their actions affect the child. The author has tried to manage the situation, but the in-laws' conduct has been consistently harmful.\n\nIn family dynamics, sometimes difficult decisions must be made to protect a child's emotional health. If the in-laws are unable or unwilling to participate in a positive way, it's reasonable for the author to exclude them. The key here is the impact on the daughter. Her feelings of being unloved and the trauma from previous parties are significant. The author's decision to exclude the in-laws is an effort to create a safe and positive environment for the daughter, which is a parent's responsibility.\n\nHowever, there's a potential conflict with the husband's family. The author mentions the husband's anger towards the in-laws, but they managed to navigate that. The in-laws' own behavior\u2014like leaving during the party, arguing publicly, and threatening violence\u2014indicates they are not contributing positively. Excluding them isn't just about the author's feelings but about protecting the child from their toxic behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision seems justified. They're acting in their daughter's best interest. While family gatherings can be important, the in-laws' actions have repeatedly caused harm. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're making a choice to prevent further distress. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
