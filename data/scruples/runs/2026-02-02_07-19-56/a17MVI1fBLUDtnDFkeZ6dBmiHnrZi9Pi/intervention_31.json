If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting in-laws to their daughter's birthday. The situation seems pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the in-laws don't like them and their actions make the daughter feel bad. The daughter's birthdays have been ruined in the past by the in-laws leaving quickly, not eating the cake, and even causing a public argument last year. The daughter ended up crying and feeling unappreciated. The author is considering not inviting them again this year to prevent more hurt.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to determine if that's actually the case. The key factors here are the well-being of the daughter and the intent behind the in-laws' actions. The author believes that the in-laws' behavior is unintentional but still harmful. If the in-laws aren't aware of how their actions affect the daughter, is it the author's responsibility to protect her? \n\nIn most cases, protecting a child from harmful or hurtful situations is considered a parent's duty. The author isn't just doing this out of spite but to prevent emotional damage. The daughter has consistently been negatively affected by their presence, so excluding them could be a necessary step. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should be included, but if the in-laws are actively causing distress, that argument weakens. The author has tried to include them before, but it resulted in chaos. The daughter's emotional health seems to be the priority here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably not in the wrong. They're making a decision to protect their child from repeated trauma caused by family members who aren't aware of their impact. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
