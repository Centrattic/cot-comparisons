If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The background is that the in-laws don't like the author and their behavior makes the daughter feel unappreciated. The daughter's birthdays have been consistently upsetting because the in-laws don't engage positively, leading to a traumatic incident last year where the in-laws caused a public scene, ruining the party and making the daughter cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The author's primary concern is their daughter's emotional well-being. The in-laws' actions are directly causing her distress, and the author is trying to protect her. The question is whether excluding the in-laws from the birthday is wrong.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, there's often an expectation to include certain relatives, but the author's reasoning is that the in-laws' presence is harmful. Since the in-laws are not acting in the best interest of the child and are contributing to her negative experiences, the author's decision could be seen as a protective measure. The daughter's well-being is paramount, especially since children rely on parents to make decisions in their best interests.\n\nHowever, there might be considerations about the in-laws' potential feelings. But if the in-laws have already shown a pattern of negative behavior and don't seem to respect the child's needs, their feelings might not outweigh the child's. The author is trying to prevent further harm, which is a valid concern. \n\nLooking at the incident described, the in-laws' actions were not just passive neglect but active disruption, leading to a public argument and the daughter's distress. The author has tried to reason with them before, but the situation escalated. This suggests that previous attempts to include them have failed. \n\nIn such cases, the parent's role is to ensure the child's safety and happiness. Excluding the in-laws could be a necessary step to prevent future trauma. The author isn't ignoring the in-laws entirely but is making a choice based on the child's emotional health. \n\nThere's also the aspect of teaching the daughter to assert herself, but the author already regrets not supporting her in standing up to the in-laws. By excluding them, the author is taking responsibility for their previous decisions and trying to correct the situation. \n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's decision isn't in the wrong. They're acting to protect their child from repeated harm, which is a parent's duty. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
