If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The situation described is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the in-laws don't like them, and their behavior causes the daughter emotional distress. The daughter ends up crying because the in-laws leave quickly and don't engage properly in her birthday celebrations. There's a specific incident where the in-laws forgot the party plans they had just made, leading to a public meltdown. The in-laws' actions have repeatedly made the daughter feel unappreciated and hurt.\n\nThe key question is whether deciding not to invite the in-laws is wrong. The author is considering this change to protect their daughter's feelings. So, what's the moral or social obligation here? On one hand, family events often include extended family, especially for something like a child's birthday. Not inviting them might be seen as cutting off family ties, which could be viewed as harsh. However, the in-laws' behavior has been harmful to the child's emotional well-being. The author is trying to prevent further harm, which seems like a protective measure.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the daughter's feelings. If the in-laws are present, they might ruin the party again, but excluding them could make the daughter feel that the family is being excluded. However, the author is doing this to protect her from negative experiences. The daughter has expressed that she's unsure about having a party because they always end badly. So, the author's decision might be in the child's best interest.\n\nAnother angle is the in-laws' actions. If they are aware of their behavior and the author hasn't tried to address it directly, maybe the author should first try to communicate. But the author seems to have tried before (like the husband's frustration) but to no avail. The in-laws either don't realize the impact or don't care. In that case, excluding them could be justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is trying to protect their child from emotional harm caused by the in-laws' consistent negative behavior. The decision not to invite them isn't out of spite but to prevent further distress. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
