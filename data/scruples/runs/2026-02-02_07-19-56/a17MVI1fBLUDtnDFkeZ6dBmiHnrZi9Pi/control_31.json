If I thought they did it purposefully I would have put an end to them being involved in her life years ago but I honestly don't think they realize how much it affects her.  One major way she becomes collateral damage is her birthday. \n\nMy daughters birthday has always ended with her crying because (in her words) no body cares about her. Usually this is because my in-laws refuse to eat her cake since I make it and leave as fast as they can. One year they even used the wind as an excuse to leave when she hadnt even finished opening her gifts. Nothing major for an adult but when you are a young kid birthdays are special and seeing people you love not want to celebrate it is devastating.\n\nLast year was the absolute worst. My daughter was turning13 and she was extra excited since she was officially a teenager. We made plans with MIL to have the party in my in-laws backyard. The day of the party there was a parade which my daughter was in and the whole family went to watch. That is when my MIL asked what we were doing for the party. Having just discussed this very subject days before my husband and I were quite confused and irritated. I admit, my husband got more angry than was warranted but after years of having his family treat our daughter's birthday as no big deal it was the final straw. This is when shit hit the fan.\n\nSIL decides she needs to defend mom because husband is questioning how she can forget plans we just made. SIL starts cussing husband out, husband is having none of it and yes right back at her. MIL starts literal screaming (not words just high pitched screeching) SIL threatens to punch husband, to which he dares her to do it. The reason of us were dumbfounded by the whole situation an could do nothing but watch as it all unfolded.  I have never in my life seen the amount of dipshittery I saw in that 5 minutes. Let me remind you, they are grown ass adults in public. It was ridiculous and humiliating.\n\nMy daughter yet again ended up crying because her birthday was ruined. I do my best to cheer her up and salvage the day but it was useless. Later that night, my in-laws want to give her gifts but she is hurt and pissed off, wanting nothing to do with any of them, her father included. Despite my own anger, I convince her she needs to be the bigger person. A decision I regret to this day. I taught her that she shouldn't stand up for herself when it's family being assholes.\n\nEventually life got back to normal but this year when I asked what she wanted to do for her birthday she said she wasn't even sure she wanted a party because they always just end up making her feel like crap. That broke my heart. Since they are the cause of her feeling like that WIBTA if we had a party and didn't my invite in-laws?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not inviting their in-laws to their daughter's birthday party. The situation is complicated because the in-laws don't like the author and their actions have been negatively affecting the daughter's experience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the story. The daughter's birthdays have been consistently distressing because the in-laws don't engage properly. They leave quickly, avoid the cake, and even caused a public meltdown at the last party. The daughter ends up crying each year, feeling unappreciated. The author's husband had a justified reaction, and the in-laws were disrespectful in public. The daughter now feels hesitant about having a party because of these experiences.\n\nThe author is now considering not inviting the in-laws to protect the daughter's feelings. The question is whether this decision is wrong. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI should think about family obligations versus the daughter's well-being. Typically, family events are meant to include relatives, but in this case, the in-laws are causing harm. The author isn't excluding them for selfish reasons but to protect their child's emotional health. The story emphasizes that the in-laws don't realize the impact of their actions, but their behavior is still harmful. \n\nIn such cases, prioritizing a child's emotional safety over extended family expectations is generally considered reasonable. The author is trying to create a positive experience for the daughter without the negative influence of relatives who have shown they can't be supportive. The in-laws' actions have been dismissive and even abusive in the past, so excluding them isn't a punishment but a protective measure.\n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that the author should have addressed the in-laws' behavior earlier or tried to mediate. However, the story indicates that the author has tried to manage the situation, and the in-laws haven't changed. The daughter's repeated distress is a strong point in favor of the author's decision.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The decision is based on protecting the child from consistent emotional harm caused by relatives who are unwilling or unable to be supportive. So the answer is B.\n"
