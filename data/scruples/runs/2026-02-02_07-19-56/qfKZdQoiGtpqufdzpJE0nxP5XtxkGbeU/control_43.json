She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague inquiring about their use of crutches, and the author responding with a somewhat dark comment. The colleague then advises positivity, and the author pushes back, pointing out the difference in their lifestyles and the stigma around disabled people being submissive.\n\nFirst, the author's right to discuss their own disability. People have the right to be open about their personal situations, including disabilities. So, sharing that they've used crutches for 15 years is their choice. The colleague's surprise might stem from not knowing the full story, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong for sharing it.\n\nNext, the author's response about using crutches until death. It's a bit harsh and could be seen as defeatist, but it's a personal truth. The colleague's reaction is to insist on positivity, which can sometimes come off as dismissive of the author's actual experience. The author's reply about not having the same lifestyle is a valid defense against the colleague's judgment. It's about challenging the idea that people with disabilities should be grateful or always positive.\n\nThe social stigma mentioned here is important. There's a pressure on disabled individuals to be \"inspirational\" or \"positive,\" which can invalidate their real feelings and struggles. The author's pushback against that is a form of self-advocacy. They're asserting that it's okay to acknowledge the difficulties without being overly submissive.\n\nHowever, the author's comment about meeting their grave might be unnecessarily grim. While they have the right to their feelings, the delivery could be seen as negative. But the colleague's insistence on a specific mindset (God will help) might not be supportive either. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their reality, even if others disagree.\n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were being honest about their experience and defending against unwarranted advice. The colleague's reaction is part of the social stigma, not the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
