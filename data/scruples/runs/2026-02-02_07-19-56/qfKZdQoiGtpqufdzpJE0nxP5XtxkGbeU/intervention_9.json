I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking about the duration of their use of crutches and a subsequent conversation that turned tense.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The author has a disability requiring crutches for about 15 years, which implies a long-term condition. When the colleague asked about how much longer they might need them, the author responded with a darkly humorous or blunt statement about it being until their grave. The colleague then advised positivity, citing faith, which the author pushed back against, mentioning differing lifestyles and being called close-minded.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate if the author's response was inappropriate. \n\nThe author's response was to a personal question from a colleague. While the question might have been intrusive, the author was honest about their situation. The follow-up comment about the grave was likely a joke or a blunt way to express their reality, which some might find harsh. However, the colleague then imposed their own beliefs about positivity and religion, which the author rejected. The author's response was a defense of their own experience and a rejection of the colleague's unsolicited advice.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there can be an expectation to present a positive facade, especially in workplaces. However, the author's right to express their truth is important. The colleague's push for positivity might be well-meaning but could be seen as invalidating the author's experience. The author's rebuttal, while perhaps confrontational, was a reasonable defense of their autonomy and perspective.\n\nThe stigma mentioned about disabled people being submissive is relevant here. The author didn't comply with the expectation to be submissive, which the colleague found surprising or unsettling. This highlights a clash between the colleague's assumptions and the author's self-advocacy.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their reality. The colleague's actions\u2014pushing positivity and making assumptions\u2014could be more problematic. The author had the right to respond, even if the response was direct.\n"
