      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is open about their disability, having used crutches since they were young. A colleague asked how long they've been on them, and the author mentioned they've been on them for 15 years. The colleague was surprised and asked how much longer, to which the author replied, \"probably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\" The colleague then responded by saying they should stay positive and that God will help, implying that the author's mindset will lead to struggle. The author pushed back by saying they don't have the same quality of life and that the colleague is being close-minded. The colleague was upset because people often expect disabled individuals to be submissive, not confrontational.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author was asked a personal question about their disability. They answered honestly, even if it was a bit dark. Then the colleague tried to impose a positive mindset, which the author challenged. The author's response was defensive, pointing out the different lifestyles and closing the colleague's mind. The colleague was bothered because of the social stigma around disabled people being submissive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to express their feelings, the colleague's unsolicited advice, and the social expectations placed on disabled people.\n\nDisability rights emphasize that individuals have the right to discuss their experiences without being told how to feel. The author's comment about the crutches lasting until their death is a realistic expression of their situation. The colleague's response, pushing for positivity and citing religion, might be seen as invalidating the author's experience. The author's pushback is about asserting their agency and pointing out differing life experiences. The colleague's discomfort stems from societal expectations that disabled people should be grateful and not challenge others' views.\n\nIn this context, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to be open about their disability and express their feelings, even if it's not what others expect. The colleague's advice was intrusive, and the author's response was about defending their perspective. Social norms shouldn't force someone to be submissive or overly positive when discussing their disability. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
