I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (the author) is in the wrong after responding to a colleague's comment about their disability.\n\nFirst, the colleague asked how long the author has been on crutches, and the author truthfully says since they were young, around 15 years. Then the colleague asks how much longer, and the author responds with a darkly humorous comment about being on crutches until death. The colleague reacts negatively, advising the author to stay positive and mentions that God will find a way. The author then counters by saying they don't have the same lifestyle or quality of life and that the colleague is being closed-minded because of the social stigma expecting disabled people to be submissive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that the case? Let's consider. The author was directly asked a personal question about their disability. While work settings might have norms about discussing such topics, the colleague initiated the conversation. The author's response, while perhaps a bit blunt, is a truthful reflection of their situation. The colleague then tries to impose a positive mindset, which the author rightly points out is not a shared experience. The social stigma of expecting disabled people to be submissive is real, and the author is asserting their own experience and rejecting that expectation.\n\nThe key points are: the author was asked a personal question, responded honestly, and then defended their right to their perspective when the colleague dismissed their reality. The colleague's insistence on positivity might be well-meaning but could be seen as invalidating the author's lived experience. The author's response about differing lifestyles and the colleague's closed-mindedness is a valid assertion of their own experience and a push back against unrealistic expectations.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were defending their reality against someone else's assumptions. The colleague might have overstepped by making personal comments at work and then not respecting the author's response. The social stigma angle is important here. The author isn't obligated to be polite or submissive in a conversation where their experience is being dismissed.\n"
