I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a conversation with a colleague where the author's comments were met with a response that the colleague found unkind. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author has a disability requiring crutches since childhood. When asked how long they'll use them, the author responds with a darkly humorous comment about using them until death. The colleague reacts by urging positivity and mentioning God helping. The author then pushes back, pointing out the colleague's different lifestyle and implying the colleague is close-minded. The colleague seems bothered because they expected disabled people to be more submissive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault but wants a second opinion. The key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's response and whether their reaction was justified.\n\nFrom a disability rights perspective, people have the right to express their experiences, even if it's not positive. The author's comment about using crutches until death is a realistic acknowledgment of their lifelong condition. The colleague's insistence on positivity might come off as dismissive, implying that the author should be grateful or hopeful, which can invalidate someone's feelings about their lived experience.\n\nThe author's rebuttal about differing lifestyles and the colleague being close-minded is a valid defense of their right to express their reality. The colleague's discomfort might stem from societal expectations of disabled individuals being passive or eternally hopeful, which isn't fair. The author isn't obligated to adhere to those stereotypes. \n\nHowever, the author's initial comment might have been harsh or delivered in a way that could be perceived as cynical, which could have triggered the colleague's response. But the context is that the author is being asked personal questions they didn't ask for. The colleague initiated the conversation, so the author's response about their disability's permanence is a factual statement, albeit framed darkly.\n\nIn terms of workplace interactions, while it's important to be respectful, the author's right to discuss their own medical condition and their feelings about it is protected. The colleague's push for positivity without understanding the author's perspective is problematic. The author's pushback is defending their right to have a different experience and mindset.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their situation, even if it challenges the colleague's beliefs. The colleague's reaction stems from their own biases rather than the author's fault. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
