I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability.\n\nSo, the situation is that a colleague asked about the crutches and the duration. The author responded honestly about it being a long time and that it might be lifelong. The colleague then got upset, advising positivity and implying that negative thinking leads to struggle. The author pushed back by pointing out the different lifestyles and that the colleague is being close-minded. The colleague was bothered, probably because the author didn't conform to the expected \"submissive\" attitude often associated with disabled people.\n\nFirst, the author has a right to discuss their own disability. They didn't force the conversation; the colleague initiated by asking. The author's response about the crutches lasting until death is a factual statement based on their experience. The colleague's reaction seems to be projecting their own beliefs about positivity, which can be hurtful. The author defending their perspective is valid because they're asserting their reality. The social stigma part is important\u2014disabled people often face expectations to be grateful or less vocal about their struggles. The author's response challenges that stigma, which is a positive thing. The colleague's insistence on positivity without understanding the author's lived experience might be the real issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their experience. Answer B.\n"
