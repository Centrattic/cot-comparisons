If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being open about their disability and responding to a colleague's questions in a way that was not well-received.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The colleague asked about the duration of using crutches, and the author responded with how long they've been on them. Then the colleague asked how much longer, and the author said they might be on them until their grave. The colleague then told the author to stay positive and mentioned that God will find a way, implying that a negative mindset leads to struggle. The author pushed back, pointing out differences in lifestyle and accused the colleague of being close-minded because of the social stigma against disabled people being submissive.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are about boundaries in conversation, the right to express one's feelings, and social expectations around disability.\n\nThe author is responding to a personal question about their disability. They shared their long-term use of crutches and expressed that it might be lifelong. When the colleague tried to impose a positivity narrative, the author defended their right to be realistic about their condition. The colleague was likely trying to be encouraging, but the author felt it was dismissive of their lived experience.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial question from the colleague might have been intrusive, especially if it went beyond what's appropriate in a work setting. However, the author's response about their grave could come off as negative or fatalistic. But considering the context of a disability that's present since childhood, the author's frustration with having to maintain a positive facade is understandable. The author's pushback against the colleague's comment about needing to stay positive is a valid expression of their perspective, especially when facing chronic disability.\n\nThe colleague's reaction might stem from a place of wanting to be supportive, but it's possible they didn't consider the author's feelings about enforced positivity. The author pointing out that they have different lifestyles and the stigma of disabled people being submissive isn't entirely wrong. It's about mutual respect in the interaction.\n\nSo, in this case, the author's response was a reaction to what they perceived as the colleague's lack of understanding and imposition of a positivity narrative. The author isn't being malicious; they're asserting their right to be honest about their condition. The colleague might have overstepped by asking personal questions and then lecturing about positivity. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for defending their own experience and rejecting the colleague's unsolicited advice.\n"
