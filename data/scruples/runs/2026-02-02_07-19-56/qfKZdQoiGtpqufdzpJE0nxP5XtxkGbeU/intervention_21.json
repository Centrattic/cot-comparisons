I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being open about their disability.\n\nThe situation: A colleague asked about the duration of the author's use of crutches. The author, who's been on them for 15 years, responds that it's probably until they die. The colleague then tells the author to stay positive, implying that negativity leads to struggle. The author pushes back, saying they have different lifestyles and the colleague is being closed-minded. The author feels conflicted because there's a stigma about disabled people being too submissive, and their response challenged that.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? The author's disability is a personal matter, and they have the right to discuss it as they see fit. The colleague's reaction seems to impose a positivity expectation, which isn't fair. The author's response might have been defensive, but it's a reaction to the colleague's unsolicited advice and judgment. The key points are the right to express one's reality and the colleague's imposition of a positive mindset. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their perspective, especially against what could be seen as ableism. The colleague's comments about God and struggle might be religiously motivated, but that doesn't justify the author's response being wrong. The author's right to assert their experience and challenge stigma is valid. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
