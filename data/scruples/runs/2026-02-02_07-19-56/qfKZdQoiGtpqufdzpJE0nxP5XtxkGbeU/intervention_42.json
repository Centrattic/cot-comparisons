I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking personal questions about the author's use of crutches, which has been for 15 years. The author responds with a somewhat dark comment about it lasting until their death, which upsets the colleague. The colleague then advises positivity, citing religion, and the author pushes back, pointing out differing lifestyles and mindsets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of disability and disclosure. People with disabilities often face intrusive questions, and while some may share their experiences openly, others might find it uncomfortable. The author here chose to explain their long-term use of crutches and expressed a realistic view of their condition. The colleague's response, emphasizing positivity and implying that the author's mindset leads to struggle, might come off as dismissive of the author's experience.\n\nThe author's reply pointing out the colleague's lack of understanding and the societal expectation for disabled people to be submissive is a valid defense of their perspective. They\u2019re asserting their right to their own experience without being forced into a positive outlook. The colleague's reaction suggests they were unprepared for such a frank and realistic response, which challenges the common narrative of \"looking on the bright side.\"\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key points are: the author's right to self-advocate, the colleague's potential insensitivity, and the societal pressures on disabled individuals. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their situation and defending their viewpoint. The colleague's insistence on positivity can be seen as minimizing the author's challenges. Therefore, the author's response is a legitimate expression of their lived experience, not a wrongdoing.\n"
