I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author did something wrong by being open about their disability. The situation involves a conversation with a colleague where the author mentions their long-term use of crutches and makes a somewhat dark comment about continuing to use them until death. The colleague then tries to offer a positive, religious perspective, and the author responds by pointing out the difference in their lifestyles and accuses the colleague of being closed-minded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is discussing their own disability, which is a personal and sensitive topic. They were asked about it directly by a colleague, so the initial response was to the question. The follow-up comment about being on crutches until death might come off as negative or pessimistic, but it's also a realistic view for someone with a long-term disability. The colleague then responds with a positive affirmation, which the author finds dismissive of their reality.\n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the author was in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The author's response about not having the same lifestyle could be seen as defensive or confrontational. However, it's also a valid reaction to someone who might be invalidating their experience. The colleague's comment about God finding a way and the author's rebuttal about being closed-minded suggests a clash in perspectives.\n\nI need to think about disability and social norms. People with disabilities often face societal expectations to be grateful or positive, which can be invalidating. The author's response might be asserting their right to express their reality, even if it's not positive. On the other hand, the colleague's advice is common but might not be helpful in this context. The author's reply could be seen as necessary to set boundaries against well-meaning but intrusive advice.\n\nThe question is about whether the author was wrong. Legally and ethically, people have the right to discuss their conditions as they see fit. The author was responding to a personal question, and their follow-up comments, while perhaps blunt, are their own perspective. The colleague's reaction might stem from a desire to be encouraging, but the author has the right to their own experience and feelings about it. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for expressing their reality, even if it's not positive. The colleague's issue might be with the author's mindset, but the author isn't obligated to adopt someone else's perspective on their situation.\n"
