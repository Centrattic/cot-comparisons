I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in the given situation. The scenario involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches, and the author's response about possibly using them until death. The colleague then advises positivity and mentions God's ways, leading to the author pushing back about differing lifestyles and the colleague being bothered by their response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is a person with a disability that requires crutches since childhood. They were asked about it by a colleague, and when the colleague expressed a more optimistic view, the author responded with frustration about the differing quality of life and the stigma around disabled people being too submissive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author was honest about their situation and feelings. On the other, the colleague might have been trying to offer encouragement, which the author interpreted as judgment. The author's response about the colleague being closed-minded might have come off as defensive or confrontational.\n\nDisability rights emphasize the importance of self-advocacy and authenticity. People with disabilities often face societal expectations to be positive or grateful, which can invalidate their experiences. The author might be asserting their right to express their reality without being forced to maintain a positive facade. However, the colleague's reaction was likely from a place of concern or cultural norms about maintaining positivity.\n\nThe author's statement about meeting their grave could be seen as expressing the reality of living with a long-term disability, which might be a valid sentiment. However, some might argue that it's harsh or could be perceived as pessimistic. But considering the context, the author's response to the colleague's advice is about asserting their lived experience versus societal expectations.\n\nStigma plays a role here. The colleague might not realize how their comments can impose unrealistic expectations. The author pointing out the closed-mindedness is a valid critique of such attitudes. However, the confrontational tone might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. But in the context of disability, which is a personal and sensitive issue, the author's response is about defending their right to be themselves.\n\nIn terms of social norms, discussions about disabilities can be tricky. The colleague's advice to \"remain positive\" might come from a good place but could be dismissive of the author's actual experiences. The author's response highlights the difference in perspectives\u2014between someone who is able-bodied and someone with a disability. The author isn't wrong for expressing frustration with being told to adopt a mindset that doesn't align with their reality.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They were being authentic about their experience, challenging harmful stereotypes about disabled people needing to be submissive, and addressing the colleague's assumptions. While the interaction might have been uncomfortable, the author's actions were justified in asserting their identity and experiences.\n"
