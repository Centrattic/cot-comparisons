God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in the given situation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author told a colleague about their long-term use of crutches since childhood. The colleague was surprised and asked a follow-up about how much longer they'd be on them. The author responded with a darkly humorous comment about it being until their death. The colleague then pushed back, saying one should stay positive and that a mindset of struggle only brings more struggle. The author defended themselves by saying the other person doesn't live their life and that they're doing okay despite their situation. The colleague was bothered because the author wasn't being submissive, which is a common social expectation for disabled people.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was wrong in expressing their reality and pushing back against the colleague's positivity push. The author's response was honest but perhaps blunt. The colleague's reaction might stem from a place of trying to offer encouragement, but they may not understand the author's experience. However, the author is within their rights to express their feelings and not have to conform to societal expectations of being overly positive or submissive. The key here is autonomy in expressing one's own experiences and the right to not be forced into a certain mindset. The colleague's comment about God finding a way might imply a belief that disability is temporary or avoidable with enough positivity, which might not align with the author's reality. The author pointing out the difference in lifestyles and rejecting the idea that they need to be more positive is a valid defense of their perspective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their experience and not adhering to social stigma. Answer is B.\n"
