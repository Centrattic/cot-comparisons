I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in a certain situation.\n\nSo the scenario is: a colleague asks about the author's use of crutches. The author mentions having them since childhood, around 15 years. The colleague is surprised and asks when they'll stop using them. The author responds with a joke or dark humor about being on them until death. The colleague reacts negatively, saying they need to stay positive and that God will help. The author pushes back, saying the colleague has a different lifestyle and that they're being close-minded. The colleague is bothered because of social stigma around disabled people being seen as overly submissive.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about disability, communication, and social expectations. The author's comment was a bit dark, but it's a common way some people express frustration or resignation. The colleague's response is pushing positivity, which can be well-meaning but might not consider the individual's actual feelings. The author's rebuttal points out the colleague's lack of understanding and different perspectives on life quality.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author has the right to express their own feelings about their disability. The colleague's insistence on positivity could be seen as invalidating the author's experience. The author's response is a valid defense of their perspective. The colleague's reaction to the author's response might be due to societal expectations that disabled people should be grateful or not complain. However, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their own reality. They have the right to be open about their situation without being forced into a positive mindset that doesn't fit their experience. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
