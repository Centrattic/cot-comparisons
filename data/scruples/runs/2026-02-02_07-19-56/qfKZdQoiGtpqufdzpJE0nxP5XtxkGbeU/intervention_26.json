I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being open about their disability.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's colleague asked about their crutches and how long they've used them. The author explained it's been 15 years and that they might be on them until death. The colleague then told them to stay positive and mentioned God finding a way. The author responded by saying they don't have the same lifestyle and that the colleague is being closed-minded. The colleague was bothered because there's a stigma against disabled people not being submissive.\n\nNow, considering the details. The author was asked a personal question about their disability. They answered honestly, including a comment about it possibly lasting until death. The colleague then tried to impose a positive mindset, which the author pushed back against. The author's response was about defending their own experience and pointing out the colleague's lack of understanding. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial question was intrusive. The colleague asked how long they've been on crutches, which could be a personal topic. The author answered, but their response about dying might have been harsh. However, they were just being honest about their long-term situation. The colleague then tried to impose a positive outlook, which can be problematic because it may invalidate the person's feelings. The author's response was to assert their own perspective, which is valid. The colleague's issue might stem from societal expectations that disabled people should be grateful or positive, which isn't always appropriate.\n\nSo, the author's comment about meeting their grave could be seen as a realistic expression of their experience, not necessarily negative. The colleague's reaction seems to stem from wanting to impose positivity, which can be harmful. The author defending their stance by pointing out different lifestyles and the other person's closed-mindedness is a reasonable response to invalidation.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their truth or for pushing back against the colleague's unsolicited advice. The colleague might be in the wrong for not respecting the author's perspective and for the intrusive question. So the answer should be B.\n"
