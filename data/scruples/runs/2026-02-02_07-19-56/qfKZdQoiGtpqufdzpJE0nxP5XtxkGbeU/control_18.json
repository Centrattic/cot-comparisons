I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in the given situation. The situation involves a colleague asking about the author's use of crutches, and the author responding with a somewhat dark comment about possibly using them until death. The colleague then advises positivity and mentions God's ways, and the author pushes back, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of disabilities and how people handle discussions around them. The author has a long-term disability, using crutches since childhood. The colleague's question might be out of curiosity or concern, but the author's response was a bit blunt. The colleague then responds with a positive mindset message, which the author counters, pointing out differences in lifestyle and implying the colleague isn't understanding.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author is open about their disability, which is their right. They responded to a question, which is a normal conversational flow. The colleague's advice about positivity and faith might not be appropriate if it dismisses the author's reality. The author's rebuttal about differing lifestyles and the social stigma against disabled people being overly submissive is also a valid point. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their perspective, especially when the colleague's comments could be seen as invalidating their experience.\n\nBut I need to check if the author crossed a line. The comment about meeting grave might be a bit harsh, but it's a hyperbolic expression of frustration. The colleague's reaction is also a common issue where people feel they need to be positive, but that can sometimes invalidate others' feelings. The author's response is about asserting their reality, which is important for their self-worth. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
