I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is about a colleague asking about their disability and the interaction that follows.\n\nFirst, the author is open about their disability when asked. The colleague is surprised and asks more. The author responds with a pretty blunt comment about being on crutches till death. The colleague reacts by telling them to stay positive, invoking God and the idea that negativity leads to struggle. The author pushes back, saying their quality of life is different and the colleague is being close-minded. The colleague is bothered because of the social stigma around disabled people being overly submissive.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for responding that way. Let me break it down. The colleague's initial question seems harmless, but the author's response is pretty harsh. However, the author is expressing their reality and frustration. The colleague then imposes a positive thinking mindset, which can be invalidating. The author's rebuttal is about the difference in their experiences and calling out the colleague's close-mindedness.\n\nDisability rights often emphasize that individuals have the right to express their experiences without being told how to feel. The colleague's insistence on positivity might be minimizing the author's hardship. The author's response, while direct, is defending their right to acknowledge their reality. Social stigmas about disabled people needing to be submissive or grateful can be oppressive. The author is challenging that, which is valid.\n\nHowever, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical. They responded to being told to stay positive by asserting their perspective. The colleague's reaction highlights the stigma but doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong to speak up. So the answer would be no, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their experience against invalidating comments.\n"
