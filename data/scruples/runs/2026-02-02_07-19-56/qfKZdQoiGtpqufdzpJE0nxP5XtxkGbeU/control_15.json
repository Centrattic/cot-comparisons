I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by being open about their disability in the workplace.\n\nSo, the situation: A colleague asked about the length of time the author uses crutches. The author, who's been using them for 15 years, responds honestly. Then the colleague is surprised and asks how much longer. The author replies with a dark comment about using them till death. The colleague responds with a positive mindset message, citing God's help. The author pushes back, pointing out differing lifestyles and that the colleague is being close-minded because they don't understand the author's reality.\n\nFirst, the author is defending their right to express their feelings about their disability. The colleague's advice to stay positive might come off as dismissive. The author's response about not enjoying their condition and the colleague's closed-mindedness seems like a valid reaction. The colleague might be projecting their own expectations versus the author's actual experience.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The key points are the author's right to express their reality without being forced to be positive, and the colleague's judgmental response. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their perspective, especially when the colleague's comments impose a view that might not align with the author's lived experience. The stigma mentioned about disabled people being submissive is relevant here\u2014the author is pushing back against that stereotype by being assertive.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author isn't wrong for being open and defending their perspective against an unsolicited and judgmental comment.\n"
