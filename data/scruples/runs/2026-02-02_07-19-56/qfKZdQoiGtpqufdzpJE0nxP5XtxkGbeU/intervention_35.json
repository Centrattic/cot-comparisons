I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who shared their experience is in the wrong for being open about their disability. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author told a colleague about their long-term use of crutches and made a comment about possibly using them until death. The colleague responded by pushing positivity and mentioning God's plan. The author then pushed back, saying the colleague has a different lifestyle and that they're being close-minded.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is open about their disability, which is their right. They responded to someone's unsolicited advice about staying positive. The colleague's reaction seems to be trying to enforce a positive mindset, maybe not understanding the author's experience. The author's response might come off as confrontational, but is that wrong?\n\nDisability rights emphasize the importance of self-advocacy and authenticity. The author isn't wrong for expressing their reality. However, the colleague might have been trying to be supportive, albeit in a way that's not helpful. The author's pushback could be seen as defending their right to be honest about their situation. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's response was defensive or harsh, maybe. However, the colleague initiated the conversation and made assumptions. The author's response was about clarifying their experience and rejecting the colleague's unsolicited judgment. \n\nSo, considering that, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their right to discuss their disability on their terms without being forced into a positive narrative. The colleague's approach was problematic, and the author's response was valid.\n"
