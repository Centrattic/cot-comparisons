I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability when a colleague asked about their crutches.\n\nFirst, the colleague approached the author and asked about the duration of using crutches. The author responded truthfully about having used them for 15 years. The colleague then asked how long they'd be on them, and the author made a darkly humorous comment about it being until their death. The colleague responded by encouraging positivity, referencing God, and implying that negative thoughts lead to struggle. The author then defended themselves by pointing out the differing lifestyles and accused the colleague of being close-minded.\n\nNow, considering the social context. The author's response was honest about their situation, which is a personal right. Having a disability doesn't require one to maintain a certain attitude. The colleague's advice might be well-intentioned, but it's not the best approach. The author's defense was direct, which might come off as confrontational, but they were being factual about their experience. There's a stigma that disabled people should be overly positive, but the author is challenging that by stating their reality. \n\nHowever, the author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of a confrontational response, maybe a more neutral explanation of their feelings could have been better. But the colleague's initial reaction and the societal pressure to be positive might have pushed the author's frustration. The key here is autonomy in expressing one's experiences and the right to not feel obligated to be positive all the time. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their perspective.\n"
