I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The scenario involves a conversation where the author's colleague asked about their crutches. The author explained their long-term use and made a somewhat dark joke about it. The colleague responded by advising positivity, and the author pushed back, leading to some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The colleague's reaction is rooted in a common sentiment that people should stay positive, especially regarding their health. However, the author is expressing their reality, which is valid. The author isn't being rude or aggressive but is stating their experience. The colleague's advice, while well-intentioned, might not consider the author's lived experience.\n\nThe key points here are the right to self-expression and the expectation of positivity. The author isn't wrong for discussing their disability openly. People with disabilities often face intrusive questions, and responding honestly is a form of self-advocacy. The colleague's reaction might stem from a lack of understanding or sensitivity, not the author's wrongdoing.\n\nAlso, the author's response about not enjoying their state is a legitimate assertion of their autonomy. The colleague's comment about God finding a way could be seen as dismissive of the author's reality. The author's pushback is a defense of their own experience, which is valid.\n\nSocial stigma about disabled people needing to be overly submissive is a real issue. The author challenging that expectation isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to have a different perspective without being forced into a positive mindset that doesn't align with their experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to express their truth and set boundaries in conversations about their disability. The colleague's expectation of positivity and the societal stigma are the issues here, not the author's response.\n"
