I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a colleague asked about their use of crutches. The author mentioned they've been on them since they were young, around 15 years. The colleague was surprised and then asked how much longer they'll be on them. The author responded with a dark joke about it being till their grave. The colleague didn't like that and told the author to stay positive, mentioning God's help. Then the author pushed back, saying their lifestyles are different and the colleague is being close-minded. The colleague was upset because of the social stigma against disabled people being too assertive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability and uses crutches. They're responding to a colleague's questions. The colleague might have had good intentions but perhaps didn't realize the impact of their comments. The author's response was a bit dark, but maybe they felt it was a reasonable reaction given the situation. The colleague then told them to be positive and invoked religion, which the author saw as dismissive of their reality.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone shares personal information about their disability, others might overstep by making assumptions or pushing for positivity. The author's response about lifestyle differences could be defending their right to be honest about their situation. However, the initial joke about the grave might have been harsh, even if it's a way to cope. But is it the author's fault for being honest about their experience?\n\nDisability rights often emphasize that people should have the autonomy to express their feelings without being forced into positivity. The colleague's reaction might be more about their own discomfort than the author's wrongdoing. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their reality. The colleague's issue is more about their own expectations and the stigma they hold, not the author's response. The author's defense about different lifestyles is valid because their experience is different. The key here is that the author isn't to blame for being honest about their disability and the challenges they face.\n"
