I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for being open about their disability.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a disability and uses crutches since childhood. A colleague asked about it, and the author responded honestly, saying they might be on them until death. The colleague then advised staying positive and mentioned God's help. The author pushed back, pointing out differing lifestyles and quality of life, and the colleague was bothered by the response.\n\nNow, considering disability rights and social norms. Openly discussing one's disability isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to be honest about their experiences. The colleague's reaction seems to stem from a place of perhaps trying to be encouraging, but the author's response was defensive, which the colleague found uncomfortable. \n\nThe key points here are the right to self-expression versus social expectations. The author isn't doing anything harmful by being truthful. The colleague's advice about positivity might be well-meaning but could come off as dismissive of the author's reality. The author's response was asserting their own experience, which is valid. \n\nAlso, the social stigma mentioned\u2014disabled people being expected to be subdued\u2014plays a role here. The author's reaction challenges that stigma, which is a positive thing. The colleague's discomfort might be due to not expecting such a direct response. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their truth. The colleague's advice was perhaps overstepping, but the author's response was a legitimate assertion of their own perspective. There's no clear wrongdoing here. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
