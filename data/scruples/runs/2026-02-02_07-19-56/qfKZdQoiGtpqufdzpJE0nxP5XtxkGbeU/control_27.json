I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches since childhood, and the author's response was something about being on them until they die. The colleague then tells them to stay positive and mentions God finding a way. The author responds back about different lifestyles and the colleague being close-minded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability and has been using crutches for 15 years. When asked how much longer, they respond with a dark comment. The colleague's reaction is to push positivity, which the author then challenges. \n\nThe key points here are about disability rights and personal boundaries. The author is defending their right to express their reality without forced positivity. The colleague's insistence on positivity might be seen as invalidating the author's experience. The author's response, while perhaps harsh, is a reaction to that invalidation. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine if the author's response was inappropriate. The author's comment about meeting their grave is a bit morbid but is a response to the colleague's comment. However, in a work setting, maintaining professionalism is usually expected. But the author is also justified in defending their experience from forced positivity. \n\nThe colleague's statement about God finding a way could be seen as making assumptions about the author's beliefs or future. The author's rebuttal about different lifestyles might be necessary to assert their autonomy. \n\nIn disability discourse, there's a lot about not having to adopt a \"positive\" narrative. The author is resisting that pressure. However, in a workplace, how direct someone can be about their disability depends on the context. The author didn't disclose unnecessary info but was honest when asked. \n\nThe colleague's reaction might stem from cultural or religious views, but the author's right to their own perspective is valid. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're standing up for their experience. The colleague's reaction is problematic for invalidating the author's reality.\n"
