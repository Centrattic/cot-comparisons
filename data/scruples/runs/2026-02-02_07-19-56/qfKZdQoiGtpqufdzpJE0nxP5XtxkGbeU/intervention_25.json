If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation is that a colleague asked about the author's use of crutches, and the author explained it's been 15 years. When the colleague asked how much longer, the author replied darkly, \"probably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\" The colleague then told the author to stay positive and that God will find a way, implying that a negative mindset leads to struggle. The author responded by saying they don't have the same lifestyle and the colleague is being close-minded.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct. Let's break it down. The author's disability is a lifelong condition, and they've been on crutches since childhood. The colleague's advice seems to come from a place of wanting to be positive, but it might not consider the reality of the author's situation. The author's response was defensive, pointing out the colleague's misunderstanding of their life experience.\n\nIs the author wrong for expressing their true feelings? Well, they were asked a personal question, so they had the right to respond. However, their response was a bit caustic. The colleague might have felt dismissed or hurt by the author's remark. But the colleague's advice also might not be helpful, as it's a common but problematic notion that people with disabilities should always be positive. The author's frustration with having to be submissive is valid because there's a stigma against disabled people expressing anger or frustration.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? The author's response was a bit harsh, but the colleague's advice was also not particularly supportive. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their experience. The issue is more about differing perspectives and communication styles. The author's comment about meeting their grave was probably meant to be sarcastic, but it could come off as negative. However, the colleague's insistence on positivity without understanding the author's lived experience is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's important to respect others' feelings. The author might have overstepped by making a dark joke, but they were also defending their right to have a different outlook. The colleague's reaction might stem from good intentions but lacks empathy for the author's actual life with a disability. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they were asserting their reality. The colleague could have approached the conversation differently as well.\n"
