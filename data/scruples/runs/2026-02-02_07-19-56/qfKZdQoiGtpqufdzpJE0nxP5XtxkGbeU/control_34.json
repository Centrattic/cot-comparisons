I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches, and the author responding with a somewhat negative comment about it being lifelong. The colleague then advises positivity and mentions God finding a way. The author pushes back, saying they don't have the same lifestyle and the colleague is closed-minded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability, using crutches since childhood. When asked about the duration, they express a resigned or fatalistic view. The colleague reacts by emphasizing positivity and faith. The author responds by asserting their different perspective, which the colleague seems uncomfortable with because of societal expectations that disabled people should be submissive.\n\nNow, the key questions are: Did the author do something wrong by being honest about their situation? Is there a wrong in expressing frustration or realism about a lifelong condition?\n\nThe colleague's reaction is based on the idea that one should remain positive, which is a common but not universal perspective. However, the author's response is a valid expression of their experience. Disabled people often face expectations to be grateful or positive, which can be invalidating. By pushing back, the author is asserting their right to have a different outlook, which some might see as necessary self-advocacy.\n\nThe stigma mentioned is real\u2014there's a societal tendency to view disabled people as passive or overly grateful. The author's response challenges this, which is a positive act of self-determination. The colleague's discomfort might stem from not understanding that the author's mindset isn't about being negative but about realism.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their truth. The colleague's reaction is more about imposing a specific mindset that doesn't fit the author's reality. The author has the right to be open about their disability and their perspective on it without being forced to adopt a certain attitude. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
