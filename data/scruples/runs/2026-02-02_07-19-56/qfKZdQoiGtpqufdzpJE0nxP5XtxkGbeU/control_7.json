I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author has a disability and uses crutches since they were young. A colleague asked about how long they've been on crutches, and the author responded honestly that it's been 15 years. Then the colleague asked how much longer, and the author made a dark joke: \"probably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\" The colleague was upset, said the author needs to stay positive, and mentioned God finding a way. The author then pushed back, saying they don't have the same lifestyle and that the colleague is close-minded. The colleague was bothered because of the social stigma around disabled people being overly submissive.\n\nFirst, I should consider the author's perspective. They've lived with a disability for a long time and might feel that their situation is not something others can fully understand. The comment about the grave was probably a sarcastic or dark way of expressing frustration or resignation. The author's response to the colleague's advice was in defense of their own mindset, which might be realistic given their circumstances. They might feel that the colleague is being naive or overly optimistic.\n\nThen the colleague's reaction: they wanted the author to stay positive, which sometimes people say without understanding the actual challenges. The colleague might have been trying to be supportive but came off as dismissive. The author, however, responded in a way that could be seen as defensive or confrontational. The colleague was bothered not just by the content but also by the author not being submissive, which points to the social expectation that disabled people should be passive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about free speech, the right to express one's feelings, and the social dynamics around disability. The author's comment was a personal response to a personal question in a workplace setting. While the comment was dark, it's their right to express their feelings. The colleague's advice to stay positive might be well-meaning but could ignore the reality of the author's experience. The author's pushback is about asserting their own perspective and challenging the colleague's assumptions. Social stigma around how disabled people should behave plays a role here. Being assertive might be seen as breaking the norm, but that doesn't make it wrong. The author is not in the wrong for defending their viewpoint, especially if the colleague's reaction is based on unrealistic expectations.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have phrased their response differently. Telling someone they're close-minded is harsh, but the initial comment about the grave was pretty blunt. The workplace context is also important\u2014should personal discussions in the workplace be handled differently? But as long as the exchange was between colleagues and not disruptive, the author's right to speak their mind is valid. The colleague's reaction seems more about social expectations than actual wrongdoing by the author.\n\nSo overall, the author is not in the wrong. They expressed their reality and challenged the colleague's assumptions, which is a legitimate response. The colleague's discomfort points to existing stigmas rather than the author's fault.\n"
