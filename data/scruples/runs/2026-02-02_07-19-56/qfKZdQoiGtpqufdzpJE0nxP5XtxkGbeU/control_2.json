I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post (AITA) is in the wrong for being open about their disability.\n\nSo the situation is that the author was asked about their crutches by a colleague. They mentioned they've been on them for 15 years and joked that they'll probably use them till they die. The colleague didn't like that and told the author to stay positive, referencing God helping. The author responded by pointing out that their lifestyles and quality of life are different, and that the colleague is being closed-minded. The colleague was upset because there's a stigma that disabled people should be submissive, and the author's assertiveness surprised them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms. People with disabilities often face expectations to be grateful or positive, even in the face of challenges. The author's response might be seen as challenging those norms. The colleague's comment about staying positive could be seen as well-meaning but patronizing, assuming the author needs to have a more optimistic outlook.\n\nThe author's reply about not enjoying their state and the colleague being closed-minded is a defense of their right to be honest about their experience. The colleague seemed bothered because the author wasn't being submissive, which points to societal issues where disabled individuals are expected to be passive or grateful. The author's reaction is asserting their own experience and rejecting the colleague's unsolicited advice.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no wrongdoing here. The author has the right to express their feelings about their disability. The colleague's response, while perhaps coming from a place of trying to be supportive, might be insensitively dismissive of the author's lived experience. The author isn't obligated to maintain a positive facade if that doesn't align with their reality.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they were responding to a colleague's comment that could be seen as intrusive or patronizing, their response seems justified. The colleague's expectation of positivity might be a form of ableism, expecting disabled people to adhere to certain emotional responses. The author's stance is about self-advocacy and authenticity, which are important in challenging stigma.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are defending their right to express their true feelings about their condition without being forced into a submissive or overly positive role. The colleague, while perhaps not malicious, might not have been considering the author's perspective, leading to the conflict.\n"
