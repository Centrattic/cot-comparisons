I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability and how they responded to a colleague's question.\n\nFirst, the colleague asked about the length of time on crutches, and the author, who's been using them since being young, said they might be on them until they die. The colleague then told the author to stay positive and referenced God helping. The author responded by pointing out the difference in lifestyle and accused the colleague of being close-minded. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to see if that's accurate. The key points here are about disability, personal mindset, and social expectations. \n\nThe author is expressing their reality, which might be seen as honest. However, the colleague might have felt that the author's response was negative or discouraging. The author's reply about the colleague being close-minded could be seen as defensive or confrontational. \n\nBut disability rights often emphasize the importance of individuals expressing their experiences without being forced to be positive. The idea that people should be \"positive\" about their disabilities can sometimes invalidate their real struggles. The author's response might be asserting their right to their own experience, even if it's not what the colleague expects. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's comment about meeting their grave could be seen as pessimistic, and the colleague's advice about positivity might be well-meaning but not helpful. The author's defense of their lifestyle could be justified as standing up for their own experience against a common stigma that disabled people should be overly submissive. \n\nSo, considering that the author was responding to what they perceived as an invalid or unrealistic expectation (to be positive), their reaction might be seen as justified. They're protecting their personal experience and challenging the stigma. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
