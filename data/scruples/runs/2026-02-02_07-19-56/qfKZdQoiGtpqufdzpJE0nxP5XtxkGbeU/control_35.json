I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in a work conversation.\n\nFirst, the colleague asked about the duration of using crutches. The author responded honestly, mentioning it's been 15 years. Then, when asked how long they'll be on them, the author made a darkly humorous comment about it being until death. The colleague took offense, urging positivity and referencing faith. The author then pushed back, pointing out the difference in lifestyle and accusing the colleague of being close-minded.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author has a long-term disability. They were responding to a personal question from a colleague. The key points are the appropriateness of the author's response and the colleague's reaction. The author's comment was a bit blunt and maybe a bit harsh, but it's a personal situation. The colleague's advice about positivity could be seen as well-meaning but perhaps not considering the author's experience. The author's response defending their lifestyle is valid because they are acknowledging their reality.\n\nIn terms of workplace interactions, there's a balance between being honest and maintaining professionalism. The author's initial response might be seen as candid, but the follow-up about the grave could be considered unprofessional. However, the colleague's insistence on positivity without understanding the author's perspective might also be problematic. The social stigma mentioned about disabled people being submissive is a real issue, so the author's pushback against that is justified.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped. While the author's comment was perhaps a bit strong, it's in response to a personal question. The colleague's reaction is based on their own views, and the author's right to express their experience is important. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
