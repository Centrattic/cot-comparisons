I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the colleague approaches the author and asks how long they've been on crutches. The author responds honestly, saying since they were young. Then the colleague is surprised and asks how much longer, which the author answers with a darkly humorous comment about being on crutches until death. The colleague reacts by telling the author to stay positive and mentions God finding a way. The author then counters by pointing out the difference in their lifestyles and accuses the colleague of being close-minded.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the author's right to express their feelings about their disability and the colleague's reaction. The author's response about being on crutches until death is a personal expression of their reality. People with disabilities often face societal expectations to remain positive, which can be invalidating. The author's defense of their mindset is a valid assertion of their perspective. The colleague's comment about God finding a way might be well-meaning but could come off as dismissive of the author's lived experience. The author's pushback against the colleague's response is about maintaining their own narrative and resisting social stigma that expects disabled people to be submissive. \n\nConsidering these factors, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to express their feelings about their disability, even if it's not what others expect. The colleague's reaction reflects common but problematic attitudes towards disabilities, and the author's response is a legitimate stand against that. So the answer is B.\n"
