I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches and the author responding with a somewhat negative comment about being on crutches until death. The colleague then advises positivity, and the author pushes back about differing lifestyles and societal expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The author has a disability and uses a crutch for 15 years. When asked about future use, they respond with a darkly humorous remark. The colleague reacts by telling them to stay positive, citing faith, which the author then counters by pointing out the difference in their lifestyles and societal expectations.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to express their feelings about their disability, the colleague's reaction, and the author's defense of their perspective. The question is whether the author did something wrong by being open about their disability and their realistic outlook, or if they overstepped.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people with disabilities often face pressure to be positive or to downplay their struggles. The author's response might be seen as challenging that pressure, asserting their right to express their reality. However, some might argue that the author's comment about meeting their grave could be insensitive or overly negative in a professional setting, especially if it's taken as a lack of hope or resilience.\n\nBut considering that the author is defending their own experience and pushing back against the colleague's judgment about their mindset, it could be a case of standing up for themselves against unrealistic expectations. The colleague's response might be seen as patronizing, suggesting that the author's negative outlook is causing their struggles, which is a common criticism people with disabilities face.\n\nSo, the author's response is a matter of personal expression and self-advocacy. They might not be in the wrong for being honest, especially if they're asserting their right to have a different perspective. The colleague's reaction could be the real issue here, as it's the colleague who's imposing their views on the author's personal experience.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are expressing their reality and pushing back against societal expectations, which is a valid stance. The colleague's insistence on positivity without acknowledging the author's lived experience might be the problem instead.\n"
