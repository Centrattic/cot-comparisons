I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation at work where the author discusses their long-term use of crutches. The colleague is surprised and then responds with comments about staying positive and God's plan. The author counters by pointing out the difference in their lifestyles and the colleague's closed-mindedness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the elements of the situation. The author is being open about their disability, which is a personal choice. The colleague's reaction seems to pressure the author to maintain a positive mindset, implying that the author's negative outlook is problematic. The author's response is defensive, highlighting the lack of shared experience and possible stigma around disabled individuals being too submissive.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Right to Self-Expression**: People have the right to express their feelings and experiences, even if they're not positive. The author's comment about using crutches until death is a personal perspective and doesn't directly harm others.\n\n2. **Respect and Boundaries**: The colleague's initial question might be intrusive, depending on the context. The author's response defends their right to not conform to expectations of positivity, which is valid. However, the author's reply might come across as confrontational. \n\n3. **Workplace Dynamics**: In a professional setting, the line between personal and professional conversation matters. The author shared personal information, and while they have the right to do so, the colleague's reaction might stem from cultural or religious beliefs. The author's response could be seen as challenging those beliefs, which might not be appropriate in a workplace context if it causes discomfort or tension.\n\n4. **Stigma and Submissiveness**: The author mentions the social stigma against disabled people being overly submissive. Their response might be an attempt to assert their individuality against such expectations. However, the manner in which they responded could be perceived as defensive or aggressive, depending on tone and context.\n\n5. **Cultural and Religious Sensitivity**: The colleague's comments about God finding a way and mindset affecting struggle are based on her beliefs. The author's rebuttal might be seen as dismissing her perspective, which could be a point of contention. However, the author is also within their right to express their own views on their experience.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the core issue is whether the author overstepped by responding in a way that challenges the colleague's beliefs. However, the author was defending their personal experience and right to self-expression. The colleague's initial reaction might have been the first transgression by not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's response, while perhaps blunt, is a reaction to perceived insensitivity. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The situation is more about differing perspectives on handling disability and positivity.\n"
