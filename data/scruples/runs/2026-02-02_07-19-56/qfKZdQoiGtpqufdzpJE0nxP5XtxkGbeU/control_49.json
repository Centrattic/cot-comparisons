I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe author's colleague asked about their crutches. The author explained it's been 15 years and said they might be on them until death. The colleague reacted negatively, suggesting they should stay positive and that God will help. The author then told the colleague that their different lifestyles make the colleague's perspective closed-minded.\n\nFirst, the author is sharing their personal experience. When someone asks a question, they have the right to answer honestly. The colleague's reaction seems to impose a positive-only mindset, which can be invalidating for someone with a chronic disability. The author's response about differing lifestyles points out the colleague's lack of understanding. \n\nThe key here is the concept of having the right to express one's reality. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're defending their lived experience. The colleague's insistence on positivity might not consider that the author's mindset is realistic, not negative. Also, there's a social stigma against disabled people being assertive, which the author is challenging.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They're advocating for their own experiences and rejecting the idea that they must conform to others' expectations. The colleague's reaction is more about their own biases rather than the author's fault.\n"
