I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches for a long time, and the author's response about it likely lasting until their death. The colleague then tells them to stay positive, and the author responds by pointing out differing lifestyles and the colleague's closed-mindedness. The author is questioning if their response was appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author overstepped. The colleague approached them, asking personal questions about their disability. The author answered honestly, which is their right. When the colleague gave unsolicited advice about positivity and God's plan, the author pushed back, which might be seen as defensive. However, the author is defending their experience and mindset. They mention that they usually don't care about others' opinions but felt compelled to respond here. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The colleague intruded on a personal topic. 2) The author's response was honest and maybe a bit blunt. 3) The colleague's advice could be seen as patronizing or not considering the author's lived experience. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people with disabilities often face expectations to be positive or to hide their struggles. The author's response challenges that expectation, which the colleague found uncomfortable. The author isn't in the wrong for advocating for their own perspective, even if it's not what others expect. They have the right to express their reality without being forced to adopt a certain attitude. The colleague's comment about God's plan might also be seen as making assumptions about the author's beliefs or situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's response, while perhaps a bit direct, is a valid assertion of their own experience. They aren't wrong for defending their stance against the colleague's unsolicited advice. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
