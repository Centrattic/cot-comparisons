I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about someone being open about their disability. The colleague asked about the crutches, and the author mentioned they've been using them for 15 years. The colleague then asked how much longer, and the author responded with a darkly humorous comment about using them till they meet their grave. The colleague took offense, said they should stay positive, and mentioned God finding a way. The author pushed back, saying they don't enjoy it and that the colleague is close-minded. The colleague was bothered because there's a social stigma about disabled people being overly submissive.\n\nFirst, the author's initial comment was a bit dark, but they were explaining their long-term condition. The colleague then tried to impose a positive mindset, which the author felt was dismissive. The author's response was to point out the differing perspectives and the colleague's lack of understanding. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author overstepped. The author was responding to the colleague's unsolicited advice. The colleague's comments about positivity and religion might have been intrusive. The author's defense about their lifestyle and the stigma is valid. The colleague expected a certain reaction (submissiveness) which the author didn't provide, leading to discomfort. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being honest and not accepting unwarranted advice. The colleague's reaction is more about their own expectations. So answer B.\n"
