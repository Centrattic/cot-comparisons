I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches, which the author explains has been since childhood. The author's response about being on crutches until death seems to be a blunt expression of their reality. The colleague then responds with a positive mindset, suggesting that maintaining a positive attitude avoids struggle. The author pushes back, pointing out differing lifestyles and quality of life, which the colleague finds unexpected, referencing the social stigma that disabled people are often seen as submissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability and uses crutches. The colleague's initial question is out of curiosity, perhaps. The author's response about being on crutches \"till I meet my grave\" is a direct and perhaps darkly humorous way of expressing their reality. The colleague then advises positivity, which the author counters by asserting their right to their perspective and lifestyle.\n\nLegally and ethernically, is there a wrong here? The author isn't violating any rules by being honest. The colleague's comment about positivity might be well-meaning but could come off as dismissive of the author's experience. The author's response is a valid defense of their own experience and mindset. The social stigma mentioned is a real thing, and the author's reaction to it is understandable. They're challenging the expectation to be overly positive or submissive, which is a form of advocating for their right to their own perspective.\n\nIn workplace interactions, while it's important to maintain professionalism, the author's response is a legitimate expression of their feelings. The colleague's initial question and subsequent advice might not have been intrusive, but the author's defense is a reaction to perceived invalidation of their experience. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their viewpoint and rejecting the notion that they should be submissive. The key here is the author's right to express their reality without being forced to conform to societal expectations of positivity.\n"
