God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation is that a colleague asked about the crutches, and the person responded with a pretty blunt comment about being on them until they die. The colleague then tried to encourage positivity, and the author pushed back, saying the colleague is being close-minded. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability requiring crutches. They were asked a personal question at work. The colleague's initial question might be seen as intrusive, but maybe the author answered truthfully. The author's response about being on crutches until death is pretty direct and maybe a bit dark. The colleague then responds with positivity, implying that the author's mindset is negative. The author then says the colleague is close-minded because they don't share the same lifestyle.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, people have the right to express their feelings and experiences, especially regarding their own disability. However, the way they expressed it might come off as harsh or negative. The colleague was trying to be supportive, even if it was a bit pushy. The author's response could be seen as defensive or confrontational, which might not be the best approach in a professional setting. But on the other hand, the author is justified in feeling frustrated with others' assumptions or unsolicited advice. There's a balance between being honest about one's experiences and maintaining professionalism. The colleague's comment about God finding a way might be an example of well-meaning but annoying advice, and the author's response to that could be seen as a valid defense of their own perspective. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. In a work environment, it's important to maintain respectful communication, but also, the author isn't obligated to be positive if that's not their reality. The colleague's reaction to the author's response as being bothered because of social stigma against disabled people's submissiveness is a bit complex. The author is challenging that stigma, which is a positive thing, but the manner in which they did so might be seen as inappropriate. However, it's also about autonomy: the author has the right to their own experience and not have others dictate their mindset.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's response might not be the most professional, they aren't in the wrong for expressing their frustration. The colleague's approach was perhaps overbearing, and the author's defense is about asserting their own reality. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
