I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability and the subsequent conversation with their colleague.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author has a disability requiring crutches since childhood. A colleague asks about the duration, and the author responds with a darkly humorous comment about being on crutches until death. The colleague then advises positivity and faith, implying the author's mindset could lead to struggle. The author retorts by pointing out differing lifestyles and accuses the colleague of being closed-minded. The colleague is bothered because of the social expectation that disabled people should be submissive.\n\nI need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's responses and whether they crossed a line. The author's initial comment about meeting their grave is a strong metaphor, but it's a personal expression of their reality. The colleague's response about positivity might come from a place of good intentions but could be dismissive of the author's actual experience.\n\nThe author's defense is that they don't usually care about others' opinions and think they're doing well. Their response to the colleague's comment was to highlight the difference in their lifestyles and challenge the colleague's assumptions. The social stigma part is important\u2014disabled people often face pressure to be grateful or positive, and the author is pushing back against that.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the colleague was being condescending, so the author's response was defending their own perspective. The author's comment about their disability being a lifelong condition is factual, so the dark humor is their way of expressing that reality. The colleague's advice might not be helpful here, especially if the author is already coping well. The author isn't obligated to be positive in the way the colleague suggests. The response about not having the same lifestyle is valid because their experiences are different.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They were honest about their situation and challenged the colleague's assumptions, which is a reasonable response to unsolicited advice that doesn't consider their lived experience.\n"
