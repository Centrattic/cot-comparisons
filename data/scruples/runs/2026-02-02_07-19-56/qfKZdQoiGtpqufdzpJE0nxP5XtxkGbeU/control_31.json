I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in the given situation.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author's colleague asked about their use of crutches since childhood. The author mentioned it's been 15 years and said they might be on them until death. The colleague responded with a positive, faith-based message, and the author pushed back, pointing out the different quality of life and that the colleague is being close-minded. Now, the author is questioning if they were wrong for responding that way.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is sharing their experience with a disability. They responded to a comment that they found dismissive or unrealistic. The colleague's advice about staying positive and God finding a way might come off as invalidating the author's reality. The author's rebuttal about lifestyle differences and being close-minded is their way of asserting their experience.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, disability is a personal experience, and people have different coping mechanisms. The author's response might be seen as defensive, but they're also challenging the colleague's assumptions. The colleague might have intended to be supportive, but the author felt it was dismissive. There's no right or wrong here in terms of feelings. The author isn't obligated to maintain a positive mindset if that's not their reality. However, the author's tone could be seen as confrontational. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author is defending their perspective and experience, it's not necessarily wrong. The colleague's advice might be well-meaning but could be perceived as patronizing. So, the answer is likely B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their truth.\n"
