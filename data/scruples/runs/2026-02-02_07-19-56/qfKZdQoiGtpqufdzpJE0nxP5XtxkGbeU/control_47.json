I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong based on their situation. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nThe user is asking if being open about their disability made them the \"asshole\" (AITA). The situation involves a colleague asking about their crutches, and the author being honest about having used them for 15 years and not expecting to stop. The colleague then reacts negatively, advising positivity and referencing God finding a way. The author responds by pointing out differing lifestyles and calling the colleague close-minded. The colleague is bothered because there's a social stigma against disabled people being too submissive, implying that the author's response was unexpected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability, using crutches since they were young. The colleague's initial question is about the duration, which seems harmless. The author's response about continuing to use crutches till death is a factual statement of their reality. The colleague then advises positivity and mentions God's help, which might be seen as well-meaning but also as invalidating the author's experience.\n\nThe author's response that they don't enjoy their state and that the colleague is close-minded is a defense of their right to express their reality. The colleague is upset because the author didn't conform to the expected passive or submissive role that people with disabilities are often socialized into. There's a mention of social stigma against disabled people being overly submissive, which suggests that the author's assertiveness challenged that norm.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are communication and respect. The author was honest about their situation, which is their right. The colleague's advice, while perhaps intended to encourage, might be seen as dismissive of the author's lived experience. The author's response was direct but not necessarily disrespectful. They're asserting their autonomy and challenging the colleague's assumptions. The colleague's discomfort might stem from not expecting such a candid or assertive reply, which is more about the colleague's own biases than the author's fault.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of workplace interactions. If the conversation became confrontational, it might affect the work environment. But given that the author mentions being indifferent usually and only responded because of the colleague's remarks, it's a personal defense rather than an attack. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their perspective. The colleague's push for positivity might be well-intentioned but could overlook the author's legitimate feelings about their disability.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They were being open about their disability and defending their right to their perspective. The colleague's reaction is more about their own expectations rather than the author's inappropriate behavior.\n"
