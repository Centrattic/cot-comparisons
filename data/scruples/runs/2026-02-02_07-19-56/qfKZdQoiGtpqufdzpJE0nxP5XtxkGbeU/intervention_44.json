I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in the situation described.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author's colleague asked about their use of crutches. The author explained they've been on them since they were young and said they might be on them until they die. The colleague then responded with a positive message about God finding a way and not having a negative mindset. The author pushed back, pointing out that their lifestyles and qualities of life differ, and that the colleague is being close-minded.\n\nNow, considering the question of right or wrong. The author's response was defensive and confrontational. While it's understandable that the author might feel frustrated about their long-term disability, responding with \"probably till I meet my grave, whenever that is\" could come off as pessimistic or disrespectful. Then, when the colleague tried to encourage positivity, the author accused them of being close-minded, which might have been a harsh reaction. \n\nHowever, the author's disability is a personal matter, and they have the right to express their feelings. The colleague's insistence on positivity might not consider the author's lived experience and the reality of their condition. The author's response could be seen as asserting their own perspective, which is valid. But the tone and choice of words might have escalated the situation unnecessarily.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's often an expectation for disabled individuals to be resilient or optimistic, which the author is challenging. But the author's approach might not have been constructive. Instead of confrontation, perhaps a more neutral statement could have been used to express their stance without attacking the colleague's perspective.\n\nThe key points are: the right to discuss one's disability, the validity of personal experience, the appropriateness of the response's tone, and the balance between defending oneself and maintaining respectful communication. The author's response might not be \"wrong\" in terms of rights, but in terms of social interaction and maintaining workplace harmony, there could be room for a more constructive approach. However, considering the context and the author's right to self-expression, the answer might lean towards not in the wrong.\n"
