I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in this situation. The scenario involves a colleague asking about their crutches, and the author responding with a somewhat dark comment about being on crutches till death. The colleague then advises remaining positive, and the author pushes back, pointing out differing lifestyles.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of disability and societal expectations. People with disabilities often navigate a world that has certain expectations, like being positive or not complaining. The author's response about being on crutches until death might come off as negative or defeatist, but they are also expressing their reality. The colleague's reaction is to impose a positive mindset, which can sometimes invalidate the person's actual experience. \n\nThe author then responds by pointing out the difference in their quality of life, which the colleague seems uncomfortable with. There's a mention of the social stigma where disabled people are expected to be submissive. The key here is whether the author's response was inappropriate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author is within their rights to express their feelings about their disability. However, the colleague might have felt the comment was too negative. But the author is also challenging the colleague's assumptions, which is a valid reaction to being told how to feel. \n\nDisability advocacy emphasizes the importance of self-advocacy and authenticity. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their truth, even if it's not what the colleague expected. The colleague's insistence on positivity might be well-meaning but could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their experience, even if it's a difficult conversation.\n"
