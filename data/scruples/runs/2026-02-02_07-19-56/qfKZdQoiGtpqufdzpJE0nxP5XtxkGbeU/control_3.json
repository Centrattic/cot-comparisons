I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in this situation.\n\nSo the scenario is: a colleague asks about the author's crutches, they mention having them since childhood, and then the colleague is surprised and asks how much longer. The author responds with a dark comment about being on crutches until death. The colleague then tells the author to stay positive and mentions God's way. The author pushes back, saying they don't enjoy the situation and that the colleague is being close-minded. The colleague is bothered because there's a social stigma expecting disabled people to be submissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability and uses crutches. They're sharing their reality, which might be difficult. The colleague's initial reaction is curiosity but then shifts to advising positivity. The author's response is defensive and perhaps confrontational. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and social expectations. The author was asked a personal question, which might already be sensitive. Then, when the colleague started giving unsolicited advice about positivity and religion, the author responded with their own perspective. The author's reply about not enjoying their state and calling the colleague close-minded is a direct challenge. \n\nIs the author wrong for defending themselves? Well, the colleague's advice could be seen as insensitive, especially bringing up religion and implying the author's mindset is causing problems. The author is just stating their reality and pushing back against what might be considered ableism. \n\nHowever, the author's comment about grave might come off as negative or discouraging, which the colleague took issue with. But in response, the author was just asserting their right to be honest about their experience. The colleague's discomfort might stem from the social expectation that disabled people should be grateful or positive regardless. The author is challenging that, which is valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're defending their perspective and reality. The colleague's approach was perhaps more intrusive or judgmental. The author's response, while maybe blunt, is a reasonable reaction to the colleague's comments. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
