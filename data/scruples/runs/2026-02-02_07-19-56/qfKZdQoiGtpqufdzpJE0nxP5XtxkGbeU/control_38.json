I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches, and the author responds with a somewhat dark comment about possibly using them until death. The colleague then advises positivity, and the author pushes back, asserting their different lifestyle and quality of life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a disability that's been part of their life for a long time. They shared their feelings honestly, even if it was a bit blunt. The colleague's reaction seems to be based on a well-meaning but possibly intrusive perspective, suggesting that positivity can change outcomes, which might not be realistic for chronic conditions.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author's right to express their feelings about their disability. 2) The colleague's advice might be coming from a place of good intentions but could be dismissive of the author's lived experience. 3) The author's response about lifestyle differences and the stigma around disabled people being overly submissive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't obligated to be positive in the face of adversity. It's their right to express their reality. The colleague's advice might be well-intentioned but could be seen as invalidating. The author's pushback is about asserting their experience, which is valid. The stigma mentioned in the final line (disabled people being expected to be submissive) is a societal issue, not the author's fault.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their situation. They have the right to their perspective, even if it's different from others'. The colleague's reaction is more about societal expectations than the author's actual actions.\n"
