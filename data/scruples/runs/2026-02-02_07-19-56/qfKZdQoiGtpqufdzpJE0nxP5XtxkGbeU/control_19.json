I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking about their use of crutches and the author's response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has been using crutches for 15 years due to a disability. When asked how long they'll be on them, the author responds with a dark joke about meeting their grave. The colleague reacts by telling the author to stay positive and mentions God finding a way. The author pushes back, saying their lifestyle is different and the colleague is being close-minded. The colleague is then bothered because there's a social stigma about disabled people being submissive.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's right to express their feelings, the colleague's reaction, and the social stigma mentioned. The author's response was sarcastic and possibly negative, but they were defending their own experience. The colleague's advice to stay positive might be well-intentioned but could overlook the reality of the author's situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't obligated to be positive if that's not genuine. However, their response might come off as blunt or harsh. But considering the context, the author was defending their lived experience against someone's assumptions. The colleague's insistence on positivity might not be helpful, especially if it invalidates the author's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. From what I read, the author had a right to express their frustration and set boundaries. The colleague's reaction seems to stem from a misunderstanding or lack of awareness. The social stigma mentioned about disabled people being seen as overly submissive is a real issue, and the author's response was a reaction against that expectation.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They were being honest about their experience, and the colleague's response was perhaps more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
