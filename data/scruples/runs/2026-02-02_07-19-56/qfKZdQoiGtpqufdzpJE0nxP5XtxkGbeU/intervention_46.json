I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for being open about their disability. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author told a colleague about their long-term use of crutches since childhood. The colleague was surprised and asked how much longer they'd need them. The author responded with a dark joke about being on crutches until death. The colleague then criticized the author for not staying positive, implying that a negative mindset leads to struggle and that God will help. The author pushed back, pointing out the colleague's different lifestyle and lack of understanding about their quality of life. The colleague was bothered because there's a social stigma expecting disabled people to be submissive rather than assertive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The author's response was a bit caustic, using humor that might come off as defeatist. But they were addressing a situation where the colleague was making assumptions and unsolicited comments about their disability. The author's pushback is about defending their right to their own perspective and resisting the expectation to be overly positive. \n\nThe colleague's comments seem to impose a certain mindset (\"remain positive\") and make assumptions about the author's experience. The author's response, while maybe sharp, is a legitimate reaction to being judged. The key here is whether the author overstepped by being defensive or if they were standing up for their right to express their reality. \n\nIn such situations, it's common for people to feel that those with disabilities should not challenge the status quo or express frustration. However, the author's right to express their experience isn't diminished by societal expectations. The colleague's reaction might stem from a place of misguided positivity, which can invalidate the author's feelings. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asserting their perspective. The colleague's initial questions probed into personal matters, and the author's response was a reaction to being judged. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
