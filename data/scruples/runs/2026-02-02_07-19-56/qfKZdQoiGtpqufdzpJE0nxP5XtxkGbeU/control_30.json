I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in a work setting. The situation involves a colleague asking about the crutches, and the author responding with a somewhat dark comment about not getting off them until they die. The colleague then responds with a positive affirming message, and the author pushes back, pointing out differences in lifestyle and being bothered by the expectation of submissiveness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability, using crutches for 15 years. The colleague's initial question was about the duration, which seems neutral. The author's response about being on crutches until death might come across as negative or defeatist. The colleague then advises positivity and mentions God, which could be seen as well-meaning but possibly dismissive of the author's lived experience.\n\nThe author's reply that they don't enjoy the state they're in and that the colleague is close-minded could be seen as a valid defense of their right to express frustration. The colleague's reaction to the author's response might stem from discomfort with the idea that disabled individuals aren't always positive or submissive, which is a social stigma.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. The question is more about social etiquette. In workplace settings, discussions about personal health can be sensitive. The author's openness is their right, but the tone and content of the response might have been inappropriate, especially in a professional environment. However, the colleague's insistence on positivity could also be seen as invalidating the author's feelings.\n\nCultural and social norms vary, but in many workplaces, maintaining a certain level of professionalism is expected. The author's response was honest but perhaps not the most constructive. That said, the right to express one's feelings about one's condition is important. The colleague's reaction to the author's response might reflect societal expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is within their rights to discuss their disability, but the manner of the response might be seen as unprofessional. However, the colleague's push for positivity might also be inappropriate. The author's defense against the stigma is a valid point. Overall, it's a complex social situation where both parties might have valid points, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being honest about their experience.\n"
