I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who uses crutches due to a disability, responding to a colleague's questions with a somewhat dark comment about being on crutches until death. The colleague then advises staying positive and mentions God, and the author responds by pointing out their differing lifestyles and criticizes the colleague's mindset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of disability and societal expectations. People with disabilities often face assumptions about their resilience, positivity, or how they should behave. The author was open about their disability, which is a personal choice. The colleague's initial question might be seen as intrusive, but maybe they were just curious. The author's response about the crutches being until death could be seen as expressing frustration or a realistic outlook, but perhaps it was harsh.\n\nThen, when the colleague mentions staying positive and references God, the author pushes back, which is their right. The colleague might have been trying to be supportive, but the approach could come off as dismissive of the author's experience. The author's response highlights that their quality of life is different, which is a valid point. However, the tone of the author's reply might be seen as defensive or confrontational.\n\nSocietal stigma plays a role here. There's an expectation that disabled people should be grateful or positive despite their challenges. The author resisting that by asserting their perspective is understandable. However, the interaction could have been handled more diplomatically. The key is whether the author's response was unkind or unnecessarily harsh. The colleague's follow-up was perhaps well-intentioned but maybe not helpful, and the author's response was asserting their own experience, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to express their feelings about their disability. The colleague's advice might be overstepping, so the author's pushback is a valid reaction. However, there's a nuance in how such conversations are handled. The author could have been more tactful, but they aren't in the wrong for expressing their true feelings.\n"
