She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them.

God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a conversation between a disabled person and a colleague about their use of crutches and the author's response.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author has been using crutches since they were young, around 15 years. The colleague asked how long they've been on them and then followed up with how much longer. The author responded with a dark humor comment about using them till they meet their grave. The colleague then told the author to remain positive, citing religion and that a negative mindset leads to struggle. The author pushed back, saying the colleague doesn't understand their lifestyle and that the colleague is being closed-minded. The colleague was bothered because disabled people are often expected to be submissive.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider several factors here. First, disability rights and the right to self-advocacy. People with disabilities have the right to express their experiences and emotions without being shamed. The author's response, while perhaps blunt, is a defense of their own experience. The colleague's initial comment about remaining positive could be seen as invalidating the author's feelings. \n\nHowever, the author's response might have come off as confrontational, especially in a professional setting. But the colleague approached them, so it's a personal conversation. The author's comment about meeting their grave might be a humorous way to express frustration. The colleague's insistence on positivity could be patronizing, implying that the author's mindset is wrong. \n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped. The author was defending their experience against what they perceive as unsolicited advice and judgment. The colleague's reaction might stem from a place of trying to be supportive but with a one-size-fits-all approach. The author's right to express their reality is important. In disability advocacy, there's a push against the expectation for disabled people to be overly positive or submissive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were standing up for themselves against a colleague's judgmental remarks. Their response, while maybe not the kindest, is a valid reaction to being told how to feel. The colleague's behavior is more problematic for expecting positivity without acknowledging the author's lived experience. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
