I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a colleague asked about their use of crutches since childhood, and the author responded with a dark comment about it being until their death. The colleague then told them to stay positive, and the author pushed back by saying the colleague had a different quality of life and was being close-minded.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The author has a disability and has been using crutches for 15 years. Their comment about meeting their grave might have come off as negative or cynical. But they also have the right to express frustration about their condition. The colleague's response about God finding a way could be seen as well-meaning but maybe not the best approach. The author defending themselves by saying the colleague has a different lifestyle might be valid, but the way they responded could be seen as defensive or confrontational.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. In terms of disability rights, people should be able to discuss their experiences without being forced to be positive. But the author's response might have been harsh. However, the colleague's insistence on positivity might not consider the author's lived experience. The social stigma part mentioned that disabled people are often expected to be submissive, so the author's assertiveness might be a reaction against that. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their reality. But some might say that the author was too harsh in their retort. It's a bit of a balance between respecting the author's feelings and the colleague's intentions. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the right to express their perspective, even if the colleague was trying to be supportive. But maybe there's a better way to handle it. Still, the author isn't wrong for standing up for themselves.\n"
