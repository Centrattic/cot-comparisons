I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a conversation at work where the author shares their long-term use of crutches and a colleague's reaction.\n\nFirst, the colleague asks how long they've been on crutches. The author responds truthfully, which is 15 years. Then the colleague is surprised and asks when they'll stop using them. The author's reply is about it being until death, which the colleague finds negative. The colleague then insists on positivity and mentions God's help. The author pushes back, saying the colleague doesn't understand their lifestyle and that they're not submissive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the right to express one's reality without being forced to be positive. The author is defending their right to be honest about their situation. The colleague's reaction seems to impose a certain mindset (positive thinking) and suggests that the author's attitude is leading to struggle. The author's response is about differing experiences and rejecting being seen as overly submissive.\n\nDisability rights often emphasize that people should be able to discuss their experiences without being told how to feel or think. The author isn't harming anyone by being open; they're sharing their truth. The colleague's insistence on positivity might be invalidating the author's feelings. The author's pushback is a valid defense of their autonomy and perspective.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to express their situation without being forced into a positive mindset. The colleague's reaction is more problematic for being dismissive and making assumptions.\n"
