I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation is that a colleague asked about their crutches, and the author mentioned they\u2019ve been on them for 15 years and probably forever. The colleague responded with a more positive outlook, suggesting staying positive and that God will find a way. The author pushed back, saying they don't have the same lifestyle and the colleague is being close-minded. The colleague was bothered because of the social stigma around disabled people being overly submissive.\n\nHmm. So first, the author is sharing their own reality. They have a disability and are honest about it. The colleague's reaction is to encourage positivity, which is common but maybe not helpful. The author's response is to point out the difference in their experiences and that the colleague might be close-minded. The colleague is upset because the author didn't conform to the expectation of being submissive.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they were asked a question and answered truthfully. They expressed their feelings, which are valid given their experience. The colleague's advice, while well-intentioned, might not consider the author's reality. The author defending their perspective isn't necessarily wrong. The colleague's discomfort stems from social expectations, not the author's actions. So the author isn't in the wrong for being honest and setting boundaries. Answer B.\n"
