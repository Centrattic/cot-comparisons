I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation is that a colleague asked about the crutches, and the author responded honestly about having used them for 15 years and probably forever. The colleague got upset, told them to stay positive, and mentioned God's ways. The author pushed back, saying they don't enjoy it and that the colleague has a different lifestyle. The colleague was bothered because there's a stigma about disabled people being submissive.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The author's main act is being open about their disability and expressing a realistic outlook. The colleague's reaction seems to stem from perhaps a well-meaning but intrusive question and then pushing positivity. The author's response was to state their reality and challenge the colleague's assumptions. \n\nDisability rights emphasize the importance of autonomy and the right to express one's experiences without judgment. The author isn't doing anything harmful by sharing their situation. The colleague's comments about positivity can sometimes come off as invalidating the person's experiences. The author's pushback is about asserting their own lived experience against what might be considered ableist assumptions.\n\nThe colleague's reaction to the author's response suggests discomfort with the idea that disabled people might not be as submissively positive as society expects. The author isn't in the wrong for defending their perspective. They have the right to discuss their disability on their terms. The colleague's insistence on positivity without acknowledging the author's reality could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They are asserting their right to be open and honest about their disability and the reality of living with it, which is a valid stance.\n"
