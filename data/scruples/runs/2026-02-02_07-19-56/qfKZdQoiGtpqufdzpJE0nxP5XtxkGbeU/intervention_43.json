I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in this situation. \n\nFirst, the scenario: A colleague asked about the author's use of crutches. The author disclosed their long-term use, and when asked how long they'll be on them, they responded with a darkly humorous comment about meeting their grave. The colleague then advised positivity and mentioned God's help. The author pushed back, pointing out the difference in lifestyle and accused the colleague of being closed-minded. The colleague was upset because of the social stigma around disabled people being too submissive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's correct. Let's consider the key points. \n\nThe author's comment about \"till I meet my grave\" might come off as cynical or negative, which the colleague took offense to. The colleague was encouraging positivity, which is common but can sometimes feel dismissive. The author's response was defensive, pointing out the colleague's different lifestyle and calling them closed-minded. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a nuanced situation. The author has every right to be open about their disability and their realistic expectations. However, the tone and phrasing might have been hurtful or insensitive. The colleague was probably trying to offer support, albeit in a way that the author found patronizing. \n\nSocial dynamics often make these interactions tricky. The author's defense of their lifestyle is valid, but the way they responded could have been perceived as confrontational. The colleague's reaction, while possibly over-sensitive, is also a reaction to a blunt comment. \n\nDisability rights emphasize the importance of autonomy and self-advocacy. The author isn't wrong for expressing their reality. However, the context of a work environment might require some consideration of how comments are received. The colleague wasn't attacking the author but offering a perspective. The author's response might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the balance between self-expression and workplace etiquette. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their truth, but the manner could be seen as unprofessional. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong for being open. Since the openness itself is justified, but the specific response might be problematic, the answer leans towards not being in the wrong. The colleague's advice was well-meaning but perhaps not the author's place to dictate positivity. The author defending their stance isn't wrong.\n"
