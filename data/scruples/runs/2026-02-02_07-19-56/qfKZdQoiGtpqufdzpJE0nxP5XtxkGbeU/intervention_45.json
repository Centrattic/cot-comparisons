If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in this situation. The scenario is that a colleague asked about their crutches, and the author responded with some pretty blunt statements about how long they've been using them. The colleague didn't take it well, saying they should stay positive, and the author pushed back by pointing out that their lifestyles are different and the colleague is being close-minded.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The author is disabled and has been using crutches for 15 years. That's a long time, so it's likely a permanent condition. When asked how much longer they'll be on them, the author says \"till I meet my grave.\" That's pretty direct and maybe a bit morbid. The colleague then responds with a religious take, saying they should stay positive and that God will find a way. The author counters by saying they don't enjoy their situation and the colleague is being close-minded.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the author is being honest about their situation. They might feel frustrated or tired of people expecting positivity in situations that aren't going away. They might feel that their perspective is valid and that others are being dismissive. On the other hand, the colleague's response, while maybe well-meaning, might be seen as invalidating the author's experience. However, the author's response could be seen as confrontational or unnecessarily harsh in a professional setting, even if it's a personal matter.\n\nWorkplace dynamics are important. Even if the conversation started with a personal question, responding with something like \"till I meet my grave\" might be seen as unprofessional. The colleague's advice about positivity could be irritating, but the author's response might have crossed a line by accusing the colleague of being close-minded. The author might have the right to express their feelings, but in a work setting, the approach might affect team dynamics.\n\nHowever, disability is a protected status, and the author has the right to discuss their condition. The colleague's comment about God finding a way might be seen as minimizing the author's experience. The author's pushback could be a legitimate defense of their autonomy and perspective. But the way they delivered it might be the issue. Maybe a more tactful approach would be better, but does that make them wrong?\n\nAlso, the user mentioned the social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. By standing up for their perspective, the author is challenging that stigma, which is positive. But in doing so, they might have come off as defensive or aggressive, leading to conflict.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response was appropriate in a professional context. The initial question from the colleague might be intrusive, but the author's reply was likely more than the colleague expected. The author's rights to express their truth are valid, but so is maintaining a respectful workplace. The author's comment about the colleague being close-minded might be seen as personal and unprofessional. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong in terms of their right to express their experience, but the manner in which they did so could be problematic. However, since the colleague started the conversation, perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn conclusion, considering that the author is defending their lived experience and challenging stigma, they might not be in the wrong. However, the way they responded could have been more diplomatic. But the core issue is about the right to self-expression versus workplace professionalism. Depending on the workplace culture, the answer might vary. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that the author was defending their own experience, I might lean towards B (Not in the wrong), but there's a balance here.\n"
