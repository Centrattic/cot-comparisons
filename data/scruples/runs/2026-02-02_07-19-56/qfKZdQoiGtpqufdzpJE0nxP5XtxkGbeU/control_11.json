I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The scenario involves a colleague asking about the crutches, and the author responding with a somewhat dark comment about possibly being on them until death. The colleague then advises positivity, and the author pushes back, saying their lifestyles are different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability and uses crutches. They expressed their reality honestly. The colleague's advice to stay positive might come from a good place but could be dismissive of the author's feelings. The author's response defends their right to have a different outlook.\n\nNow, looking at social norms. There's a stigma where people with disabilities are expected to be positive or grateful, but that can invalidate their real emotions. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're asserting their perspective. The colleague's reaction might stem from a place of trying to be supportive, but it's not well-received because it's not the author's reality.\n\nThe key points are: the author was honest about their condition, the colleague's advice was perhaps uninformed, and the author's response was self-advocacy. The author isn't wrong for expressing their truth. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
