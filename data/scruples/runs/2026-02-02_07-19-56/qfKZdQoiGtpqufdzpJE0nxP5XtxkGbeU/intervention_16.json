I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after responding to a colleague's comment about their disability.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The colleague asked about the crutches, and the author mentioned they've been using them for 15 years. The colleague then asked how long they'll be on them, and the author replied with a darkly humorous comment about using them till they die. The colleague responded by saying the author should stay positive and that God will help. The author, feeling defensive, countered that the colleague doesn't understand their lifestyle and quality of life, implying the colleague is being close-minded.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. So, what's the right approach here?\n\nWell, the author has a disability and uses crutches long-term. The colleague's initial question seems genuine but might have crossed into personal territory. The author's response was sarcastic, which the colleague found unkind. The colleague then gave a well-meaning but perhaps intrusive religious perspective. The author, in turn, felt defensive and pointed out the colleague's lack of understanding.\n\nIs the author wrong for being defensive? People with disabilities often face stigma and expectations to be positive. The author's comment about staying positive could be seen as dismissive or not allowing the colleague to express their own feelings. However, the author also has the right to express their reality and frustrations. The colleague might have overstepped by giving unsolicited advice, and the author's response was a reaction to that.\n\nSo, does the author bear any responsibility? They might have been a bit harsh in their reply, especially in the context of a workplace interaction. But they were responding to what they perceived as unsolicited and possibly inappropriate comments. The colleague might not have realized the depth of the author's feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being overly defensive can sometimes be seen as confrontational, but the author is also pushing back against a common stereotype that disabled individuals should be passive or overly grateful. The author's main point is about the colleague's lack of understanding, which is valid. However, the tone and choice of words (\"close-minded\") could have been more constructive.\n\nOverall, it's a bit of a grey area. The author's response was a reaction to the colleague's well-meaning but intrusive advice. While the author's reply might have come off as harsh, their right to express their reality is important. The colleague might also have overstepped. Given that, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had a right to defend their perspective, even if the delivery could have been better. But maybe there's room for both sides to acknowledge some fault. However, since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because they were advocating for their own experience.\n"
