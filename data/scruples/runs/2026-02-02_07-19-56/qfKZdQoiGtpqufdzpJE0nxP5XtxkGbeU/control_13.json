I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The scenario involves a colleague asking about the crutches, and the author's response was pretty direct and maybe a bit dark. The colleague then tells the author to remain positive, and the author pushes back, saying the colleague doesn't understand their lifestyle. The colleague gets bothered because there's a social expectation that disabled people should be submissive, but the author isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long-term disability, using crutches for 15 years. That's a significant part of their life. When the colleague asks about how long they'll be on them, the author responds with a joke or a dark comment about it being until they die. The colleague reacts by telling them to stay positive, citing God's help. The author then defends their stance, pointing out that the colleague's perspective is different and that they're not enjoying the situation. The colleague is upset because of the social stigma around disabled people being overly submissive.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the right to express one's experience and the social dynamics at play. The author is talking about their own body and their own experience. They were asked a question, and they answered honestly, even if it was a bit blunt. The colleague's response is to pressure them into positivity, which can be seen as invalidating. The author pushing back is asserting their own reality, which is valid. The colleague's discomfort might stem from societal expectations that people with disabilities should be grateful or not complain. However, the author isn't doing anything harmful by being honest. They're not harming anyone by expressing their feelings about their situation. The colleague's advice to stay positive might be well-intentioned but could be seen as dismissive of the author's genuine experience. The author's response about differing lifestyles is a valid point; the colleague can't know what it's like to live with a disability long-term. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. People have the right to discuss their own conditions and feelings about them without being forced into positivity. The colleague's reaction seems to stem from a place of trying to be supportive but possibly insensitively. The author's defense of their right to their experience is justified. Also, the social stigma mentioned about disabled people being overly submissive is a real issue, and the author resisting that is a positive thing. They're asserting their autonomy and real feelings, which is important for self-respect. \n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
