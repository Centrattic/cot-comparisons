I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone being open about their disability and responding to a colleague's questions. The colleague asked how long they've been on crutches, and the author mentioned it's been 15 years. Then the colleague asked how much longer, and the author replied with a dark humor comment about being on crutches until death. The colleague didn't take that well and told the author to stay positive, referencing religion. The author then pushed back, saying the colleague doesn't understand their lifestyle and that they're not enjoying it. The colleague was bothered because they thought disabled people should be submissive.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the author's response and whether it was appropriate. The author's comment about meeting their grave was probably meant as a joke about their long-term use of crutches, but it might have come off as too negative or morbid. The colleague then told the author to stay positive, which can be seen as dismissive of the author's lived experience. The author responded by defending their right to be realistic about their disability, which makes sense because they aren't choosing to be disabled.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, people often have different reactions when someone is open about their disability. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their situation. The colleague's reaction might stem from a place of wanting to be encouraging, but it can sometimes come off as insensitive if it doesn't acknowledge the person's actual experience. The author's pushback is valid because they are asserting their reality and rejecting the idea that they should be overly submissive or grateful just for existing in their current state.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Since the author was defending their perspective and the colleague's initial approach might have been intrusive, the author's response seems justified. The colleague's insistence on positivity without understanding the author's experience could be harmful. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
