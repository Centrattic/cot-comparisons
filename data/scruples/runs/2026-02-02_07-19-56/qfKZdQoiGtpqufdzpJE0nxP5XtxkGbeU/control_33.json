I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves a colleague asking about their crutches, and the author responds with a somewhat dark comment about using them until death. The colleague then tells the author to stay positive and mentions God, which the author counters by saying the colleague doesn't understand their lifestyle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was asked a personal question about their disability. They answered honestly, which is their right. The colleague then made a follow-up that might have been intrusive. The author's response was a bit blunt, but it's about their lived experience. The key here is whether the author overstepped by being honest about their situation or if the colleague was being judgmental.\n\nThe colleague's comment about staying positive and God's plan could be seen as imposing their own beliefs on the author's experience. The author pushing back is valid because they have the right to express their reality without being forced into a positive mindset. The social stigma part mentioned at the end is important\u2014disabled people often face expectations to be submissive or overly positive, which isn't fair. The author's response challenges that stigma, which is a good thing. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their perspective. The colleague's reaction might be more about their own discomfort with the author's honesty. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
