God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in the given situation. The scenario is that a colleague asked about the crutches, and the author responded with a somewhat bleak comment about how long they'll be on them. The colleague then told them to stay positive, implying that their mindset is negative and causing struggle. The author pushed back, pointing out the difference in lifestyle and that the colleague is being close-minded.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's response was inappropriate. The author says they've been on crutches for 15 years and probably always will. The colleague's follow-up is about how much longer, so maybe they were trying to understand the situation. The author's response \"probably till I meet my grave, whenever that is\" is a bit dark, but maybe they're being honest. People with long-term disabilities might feel that their condition is a permanent part of their life, so this could be their reality. The colleague then responds with a positive affirmation, which could be well-meaning but maybe dismissive of the author's feelings. \n\nThe author then tells the colleague that they don't have the same lifestyle and that the colleague is closed-minded. The colleague is bothered because there's a social stigma against disabled people being seen as too submissive. The author is challenging that expectation, which could be a valid point. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author overstepped by being honest about their condition and the colleague's reaction. The author's response is a bit harsh, but it's a personal experience. The colleague's insistence on positivity might not consider the author's feelings. \n\nI think the key here is about respecting the author's feelings and their right to express their situation. The colleague's comment about God finding a way and the author's pushback are both reactions that stem from different perspectives. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest and defending their own experience. The colleague might be projecting their own views on positivity, but the author's right to express their reality isn't wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are advocating for their own experience and challenging stigma, even if the tone was a bit strong.\n"
