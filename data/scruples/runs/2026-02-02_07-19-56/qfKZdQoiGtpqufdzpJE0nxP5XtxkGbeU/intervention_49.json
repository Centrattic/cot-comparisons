I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being open about their disability. The situation involves the author's colleague reacting negatively to their response about using crutches for 15 years and expecting to use them until death. The colleague was pushing for positivity, saying God will find a way, and the author responded by pointing out their different lifestyles and that the colleague is being close-minded.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to determine if the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, the author was asked a personal question about their disability. They answered honestly, including a darkly humorous comment about not seeing a future without crutches. The colleague then told them to stay positive, which the author took issue with. The author's response was to point out that their lifestyles and quality of life differ and that the colleague is close-minded. The colleague was bothered because there's a social expectation that disabled people should be submissive, which the author defied.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's response might be seen as defensive or confrontational. But considering the context, the author has a right to express their feelings about their disability. The colleague's initial advice to stay positive could be seen as invalidating the author's lived experience. The social stigma about disabled people being overly submissive is real, and the author's response challenges that expectation. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The author was honest about their situation. 2) The colleague made assumptions and pushed positivity. 3) The author defended their perspective. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They were responding to a colleague's unsolicited advice that didn't respect their reality. Being open about one's disability isn't inherently wrong, and the author's response was a valid assertion of their own experience. The colleague's reaction stems from societal expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
