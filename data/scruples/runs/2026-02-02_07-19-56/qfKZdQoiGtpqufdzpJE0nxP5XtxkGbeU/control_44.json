I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for being open about their disability in a specific workplace interaction. The scenario involves a colleague asking about the duration of the author's use of crutches, and the author's response was a bit bleak, saying they might be on them until they die. The colleague then encouraged positivity, and the author pushed back, pointing out differences in lifestyle and being bothered by the colleague's assumptions.\n\nSo, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is discussing their personal health situation with a colleague. The colleague's initial question seems innocent enough\u2014asking about the duration of using crutches. The author's response mentions a long-term or lifelong need, which the colleague didn't take kindly to, suggesting positivity is better. The author then defends their stance, pointing out differing experiences and the social stigma around disabled individuals being too submissive.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. The author has a right to express their own experiences and feelings about their disability. It's their body and their story. The colleague's response about remaining positive might be well-meaning, but it can come off as invalidating the author's reality. The author's pushback is about asserting their own perspective and pointing out the colleague's assumptions. The colleague's reaction is based on societal expectations that disabled people should be grateful or positive, but that's not a universal truth. The author is challenging that stigma by being open about their reality.\n\nSo, the author isn't being disrespectful to the colleague. They're standing up for their own experience. The colleague's frustration might stem from not expecting a direct or negative response, but the author isn't obligated to present a more positive spin if that's not their reality. The key here is the right to self-expression regarding one's health and the pushback against social stigmas that demand a certain behavior from disabled individuals.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
