God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being open about their disability in the situation described. So first, I need to understand the context.\n\nThe author had a colleague ask about their crutches. The colleague was surprised they've been using them since they were young (15 years). The author responded that they might be on them until they die. The colleague then gave a positive affirmation, saying the author should stay positive and that God will help. The author pushed back, saying their lifestyles and quality of life aren't the same, and that the colleague was being close-minded. The colleague was bothered because there's a stigma about disabled people being too submissive, implying that the author's response was unexpected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider disability rights and social norms. People with disabilities often face pressure to be positive or to not express frustration, which can be invalidating. The author's response was defending their own experience and rejecting the colleague's unsolicited advice. The colleague's comment about needing to stay positive could be seen as dismissive of the author's reality. The author's pushback is about asserting their own lived experience versus the colleague's assumptions.\n\nDisability is a personal issue, and individuals have the right to express their feelings about their condition. The author isn't in the wrong for being honest about their situation, even if it's blunt. The colleague, on the other hand, might be overstepping by offering a positive spin that doesn't align with the author's reality. The stigma mentioned about disabled people being overly submissive suggests that the author's assertiveness is actually a positive thing, challenging those stereotypes.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're advocating for their own experience and pushing back against unrealistic positivity, which is valid. The colleague's reaction is more about discomfort with the author's honesty rather than any wrongdoing by the author.\n"
