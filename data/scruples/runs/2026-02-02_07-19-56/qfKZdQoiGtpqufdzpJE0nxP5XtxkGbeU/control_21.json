I told him that I\u2019ve been on them since I was very young (it\u2019s been around 15 or so years). She was surprised by how long that was and asked a follow-up question about how much longer I\u2019ll be on them. My response was \u201cprobably till I meet my grave, whenever that is.\u201d This comment she didn\u2019t take too kindly about and said that I have to remain positive and try not to think that way. God will always find a way for his children. If you keep that mindset, you\u2019re only going to meet struggle.\u201d I\u2019m normally very indifferent and don\u2019t care about what others say in regards to my situation and think that I\u2019m doing alright for myself, in regards to the cards that I\u2019ve been dealt. But I told her \u201cwe don\u2019t have the same lifestyle or quality of life, if you think I enjoy being in this state, then you\u2019re the one being close minded.\u201d She seemed bothered that I actually responded in that manner since there\u2019s a social stigma of disabled people being overly submissive. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disabled individual being open about their disability with a colleague.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author uses crutches since childhood (15 years) and was asked about it. The colleague was surprised and asked how much longer they'd be on them. The author responded that probably until their death. The colleague then advised staying positive and mentioned God's help, implying the author's mindset is causing struggle. The author pushed back, saying they don't enjoy the state and called the colleague close-minded. The colleague was bothered because of the social expectation that disabled people should be submissive.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The question is about whether their response was inappropriate. The author's disability is a long-term condition, so their realistic response about not expecting to be off crutches is based on their lived experience. The colleague's advice comes off as dismissive and possibly patronizing, suggesting that a negative attitude is causing struggle. The author's reply was defending their right to be honest about their situation and challenging the colleague's assumptions. \n\nLegally, there's no wrong here. Socially, there's a stigma that disabled people should be overly positive or submissive, but that's a harmful stereotype. The author is asserting their reality, which is valid. The colleague's reaction stems from that stigma. The author isn't being negative for the sake of it; they're being truthful about their circumstances. The colleague's comment about God might also be imposing their beliefs. The author had the right to respond as they did. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
