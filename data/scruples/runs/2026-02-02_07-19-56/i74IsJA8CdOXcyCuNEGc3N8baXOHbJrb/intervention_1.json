When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author turning down their girlfriend for sex and then later masturbating while she's in the house. When she walks in on him doing that, she gets upset and stops talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author said he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. That part seems respectful because he communicated his feelings. Then, later, he decides to masturbate. The key point here is that he used his laptop to do so. Using a laptop for masturbation might imply he was watching porn, which could be a sensitive issue if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with it, even if it's in private. However, the article doesn't mention any prior issues about this.\n\nWhen she walks in on him, her reaction is strong\u2014calling him a \"dick\" and becoming upset. The author is confused because he doesn't see why he's wrong. Now, the question is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, privacy matters. If someone is using a laptop for something that's typically a private act, especially if the partner isn't aware of it, that could be a problem. Even if he's entitled to privacy, the act itself might make her feel uncomfortable or used. Also, there's the aspect of using a laptop, which might make it seem like he's watching content that she might not approve of. The fact that she's upset after walking in suggests that this action crossed a line in her mind, even if he didn't mean it that way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything illegal or necessarily disrespectful. He had the right to be private, but if his actions made her uncomfortable, it's possible he didn't consider her feelings enough. The problem might be more about communication breakdown than him being objectively wrong. However, in relationships, actions that make a partner feel disrespected or excluded can be seen as wrong, even if the intent wasn't there.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because his actions led to her discomfort, even if unintentionally. He should have been more considerate of her feelings and perhaps discussed his needs and actions with her to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
