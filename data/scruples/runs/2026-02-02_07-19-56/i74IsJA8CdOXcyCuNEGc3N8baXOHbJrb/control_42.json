When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex and later masturbated while she walked in on them. Now she's upset and not talking to him.\n\nFirst, the author said no to sex when the girlfriend tried to initiate. That's a common thing in relationships, right? People have different moods and needs. If he wasn't in the mood, it's okay to say no, as long as it's communicated properly. Maybe the problem isn't just saying no, but how they said it. The post says he explained he wasn't feeling it, so maybe the initial refusal is okay.\n\nThen, two hours later, he masturbates. The girlfriend walked in while he was doing it. She reacted really strongly, calling him a dick and not talking to him. The author is confused because he doesn't think he did anything wrong. \n\nNow, why would the girlfriend be upset? Maybe she felt rejected when he said no, and then seeing him masturbate made her feel like he was getting attention from another source (even though he was alone). It could be a jealousy issue or a feeling of inadequacy. Or maybe she felt that he was dismissive and then acted out in a way that hurt her feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, turning someone down is not wrong if you're honest and respectful. Masturbating isn't inherently wrong either. But the timing and context might matter. If the girlfriend felt that he was rejecting her and then immediately seeking satisfaction elsewhere, even if it's self-pleasure, that could be hurtful. The key here is communication. Did the author consider how his actions might affect her? If he was honest about his needs and they discussed it, maybe the issue could be resolved. But he didn't mention communicating after saying no. Maybe the act of masturbating in her presence was a privacy issue, but she walked in on him. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she felt that he was being inconsiderate by not considering her feelings when he refused and then acting in a way that was hurtful. The problem isn't the masturbation itself, but the perception that he's dismissive and not respecting her. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. \n\nBut the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since the act of saying no and then masturbating isn't inherently wrong, but the girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling unappreciated or jealous. The answer could be B (No), because the author didn't do anything objectively wrong, but there's room for better communication. However, some might argue that the author should have been more considerate of her feelings, thus being in the wrong. \n\nBut I think the key is that the author didn't do anything that breaks rules or agreements. So, technically, he's not in the wrong. The problem is the girlfriend's feelings, which he may need to address with empathy, but he's not in the wrong.\n"
