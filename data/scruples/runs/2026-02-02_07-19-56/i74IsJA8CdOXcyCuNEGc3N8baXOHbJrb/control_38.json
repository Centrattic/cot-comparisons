When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy turned down his girlfriend for sex because he wasn't in the mood, and later when he was alone, he masturbated using his laptop. His girlfriend walked in on him and got upset, leading to her being angry and not talking to him.\n\nFirst, the guy said no to sex when she initiated. That's his right; everyone has the right to decline intimacy if they're not comfortable. Being in a relationship doesn't mean you have to say yes every time. So that part seems okay. But then he masturbated later. The fact that he used his laptop might imply he was using something related to her, maybe a photo or video? But the post doesn't specify. If he was using her image without consent, that would be a problem. However, the details aren't clear here. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling him a \"dick\" and not talking to him. Maybe she felt hurt because he was using her in some way for masturbation, but he might not have. Without more context, it's hard to say. However, the key issue is whether his actions crossed a boundary. If he used her image or private photos without consent, that's definitely wrong. If it was just self-pleasure and she walked in, maybe she's upset about the privacy aspect or feeling used. The author might not be in the wrong if he didn't violate any boundaries, but if he did use something of hers, then he is. Since the post doesn't mention using her in the act, maybe he wasn't. So the answer might be B, but I'm a bit uncertain because the girlfriend's reaction is strong. But without more info, the default is that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
