When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she was in the house. When she walked in on him, she got upset and hasn't been talking to him much.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said no to sex when she initiated it. That part might be okay because people have the right to say no. But then he went to masturbate, which he did on his laptop. The girlfriend walked in, was shocked, and upset. \n\nNow, why would she be upset? Maybe she felt rejected or hurt by his refusal earlier. Then when she sees him masturbating, even if it's on his own, she might feel disrespected or like he's prioritizing his own needs over hers. There's a possible lack of communication here. Did he consider her feelings when he turned her down? Maybe she was trying to connect and he didn't communicate his feelings properly.\n\nAlso, when he's masturbating on the laptop, perhaps he was in a private room, but if she walked in, maybe the timing or the fact that he was doing it so soon after rejecting her could be an issue. It might look like he's not respecting her efforts or his actions could be seen as dismissive. \n\nThe author says he doesn't feel wrong, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid. Even if he's not doing anything illegal, relationships involve mutual respect. Maybe he should have considered her feelings more and perhaps communicated better. He could have talked to her after turning her down to explain, instead of isolating her with his actions. \n\nSo, the main issues are communication and empathy. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how his actions would affect her, leading to her feeling disrespected. So answer A.\n"
