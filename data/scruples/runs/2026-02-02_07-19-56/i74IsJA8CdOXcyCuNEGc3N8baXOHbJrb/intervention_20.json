When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's attempt to have sex and then later masturbating, which she found out. \n\nFirst, the author refused sex because he wasn't in the mood. That part might be okay since people often have different levels of desire. But then he masturbated when she wasn't around. Now, the issue here is whether that action was a problem. \n\nThe girlfriend walked in on him while he was doing it, which probably made her feel hurt or disrespected. Maybe she felt he was prioritizing his own needs over hers, especially after turning her down. But is it his fault? Well, he didn't do it with her knowledge, so maybe he didn't intend to hurt her. However, in a relationship, actions can have unintended consequences. \n\nIf they were both in a monogamous relationship, his masturbation isn't inherently wrong. But the context might matter. If she felt rejected and then he's doing this, it could look like he's indifferent to her feelings. The key is communication. Did he consider how she might feel if she found out? Maybe not. \n\nAlso, the way he told her he wasn't in the mood might have been abrupt or not empathetic enough. Turning her down without a proper explanation could have led to her feeling rejected. Then, his subsequent action of masturbating might have been the last straw for her. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt her, the sequence of events could make him at least partially responsible for not considering her feelings. The right answer here is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't think about how his actions might affect her after rejecting her. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe some would say it's not his fault because he wasn't cheating. Hmm.\n"
