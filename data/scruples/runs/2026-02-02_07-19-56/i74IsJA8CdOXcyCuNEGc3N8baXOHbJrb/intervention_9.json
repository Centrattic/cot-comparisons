When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex because he wasn't in the mood, and later when he masturbated while she was around, she walked in and got upset. Now she's not talking to him much.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author said no to sex because he wasn't feeling it. That part might be okay because people have different moods. But then he masturbated, and she walked in. She was upset because she saw him doing that. \n\nThe key here is about mutual respect and communication. When he turned her down, maybe she felt rejected, which could have made her sensitive. Then, when he masturbated with the laptop, maybe she felt that it was disrespectful, especially if he didn't consider her feelings. Even if he wasn't cheating, the act of masturbating while she might be aware or nearby could come off as dismissive of her feelings, especially after she tried to connect with him.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is important here. She walked in and was angry. Maybe she felt like he was prioritizing his own needs over hers, or perhaps she found the act of him masturbating immediately after rejecting her as a form of emotional distance. In a relationship, both partners need to feel valued. If one person feels like their needs are being ignored, that can cause tension.\n\nThe author might not see it as wrong because he was just taking care of his needs, but in a relationship, actions can have emotional impacts. Maybe he didn't consider how his actions would affect her. If they were in a situation where they had to be together, perhaps he should have been more mindful of her presence. Using a laptop might mean others could walk in, but if they were in an apartment together, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings when she was nearby.\n\nAnother angle: communication. If he had explained his actions or why he needed time alone, maybe she would have understood. But he didn't, so she's upset. Also, after rejecting her, engaging in self-pleasure might make her feel unattractive or unwanted. Even if that's not his intention, it's something to consider.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. He didn't communicate his needs, and his actions might have hurt her feelings. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
