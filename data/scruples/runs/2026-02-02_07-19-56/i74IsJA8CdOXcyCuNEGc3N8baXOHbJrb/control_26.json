When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is: the guy turned down his girlfriend for sex because he wasn't in the mood, then later masturbated while she walked in on him. She got upset and isn't talking to him now. He's confused about why she's angry.\n\nFirst, turning down sex. In a relationship, it's generally okay to say no. People have different moods, so if he wasn't feeling it, that's his right. But maybe the girlfriend felt rejected or there's some history there? Not sure. But the question is about the author's actions.\n\nThen he masturbated. That's something he's allowed to do, but the issue is that he did it in front of his girlfriend. Wait, no\u2014he did it in front of her when she walked in. But the way he wrote it, he was using his laptop. Maybe he thought he was alone? Or maybe they were in a room where she could walk in. The problem is that she walked in and saw him. But is the act of masturbating itself wrong in a relationship? If both partners are okay with it, maybe not. But the context here is that he turned her down and then she found out he was doing it. She might feel hurt or replaced. Maybe she thought that if he wasn't in the mood, he wouldn't do it after, or she might feel like he's not respecting the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: did he have privacy? If they were in a shared space and he wasn't expecting her to walk in, maybe that's a separate issue. But if he was in a bathroom or a bedroom, that's different. The description says \"in the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room.\" So maybe they were in a room together, and he was using the laptop, which could be in a shared space. She might have felt it was a betrayal, even though he's allowed to masturbate. The key here is whether the act of masturbating while in a committed relationship, especially after turning down his partner, is wrong.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's reaction: she called him a dick and walked out. Maybe she felt he was using her as a substitute or that he was being dishonest. Or maybe she's upset because she felt rejected earlier and then saw him doing it. It's possible that she's hurt because he said no to her but then went to masturbate, which she might interpret as her not being enough for him. Even if he's allowed to masturbate, the emotional context could matter. The author might not realize that his actions were hurtful, even if they weren't technically wrong.\n\nBut according to the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. So, considering that the author didn't have malicious intent, but perhaps the action of masturbating after turning down his girlfriend could be seen as insensitive. However, masturbation isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feelings of rejection or insecurity. The author might not be in the wrong technically, but he might need to communicate better. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether the situation is fixable, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he didn't do anything explicitly wrong. But some people might argue that in the context of a relationship, certain actions have expectations. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the answer is B, but he needs to apologize and talk to her regardless.\n"
