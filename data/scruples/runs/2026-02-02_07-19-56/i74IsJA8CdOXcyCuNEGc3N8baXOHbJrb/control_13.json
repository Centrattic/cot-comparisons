When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex because he wasn't in the mood, and later masturbated while she walked in on him. She got really upset and stopped talking to him. The author is confused because he doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: he said no to sex initially, which she might have felt rejected. Then later, when he was masturbating, she saw him and reacted negatively. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is crucial. If he turned her down, maybe she felt hurt or rejected. Then, when she walks in on him masturbating, she might feel like he's being disrespectful or not considering her feelings. Even if he wasn't in the mood earlier, his masturbation in the same vicinity where she tried to connect might seem dismissive. She could see it as prioritizing his own needs over hers after rejecting her intimacy.\n\nBut on the other hand, people have different moods and needs. If he wasn't in the mood, turning her down isn't inherently wrong. However, the follow-up action of masturbating in the same environment might be a breach of respect. It could be seen as not being considerate of her feelings after she initiated intimacy and he declined. Maybe she felt he was using her for his own needs without reciprocating, which could hurt her emotionally.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's visibly upset and not talking to him suggests that his actions caused significant emotional distress. Even if he didn't mean to, the impact matters. She might feel embarrassed or humiliated when she walked in, adding to her anger. The act of masturbating while she's nearby might be a privacy issue, depending on their relationship dynamics. But if they live together, he might not see it as a big deal, but she does.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and empathy are key. The author might not see his actions as wrong because he didn't ask for her consent before masturbating, but if she was upset about being rejected earlier, his subsequent action could be seen as insensitive. He should consider her feelings and how his actions might affect her, especially after turning her down.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't take into account her feelings after rejecting her and then engaging in an activity that could make her uncomfortable, leading to her emotional distress. His actions might have been a lack of communication and empathy towards her.\n"
