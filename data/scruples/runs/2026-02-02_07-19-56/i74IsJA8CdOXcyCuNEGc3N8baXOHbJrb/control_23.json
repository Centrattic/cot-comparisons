When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is a guy in a 2-year relationship. They both got home early, and his girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. Then later, he masturbated while using his laptop, and she walked in on him. She got really upset, called him a \"dick,\" and hasn't been talking to him except for yes/no answers.\n\nFirst, turning down a partner when they're trying to initiate sex isn't inherently wrong. Everyone has moods and times when they don't feel like being intimate. But the key here is whether the author communicated his reasons properly. He says he wasn't in the mood and that he wasn't feeling it. If he was honest and respectful, maybe that's okay. But maybe the issue is that he then masturbated while she was nearby, which could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Wait, but he was alone when he masturbated. The problem is that she walked in on him. So she might feel hurt that he was getting sexual pleasure elsewhere right after rejecting her. \n\nIn relationships, how partners handle intimacy and sexual needs is important. If he rejected her and then immediately sought his own sexual satisfaction, that could be hurtful. She might feel that he didn't consider her feelings, that he prioritized his own needs over hers, or that he's being hypocritical. Even if he wasn't in the mood for sex with her, using his own time to masturbate might not be the issue, but the context\u2014rejecting her and then indulging himself\u2014could be the problem. \n\nAlso, the reaction of her being visibly upset and not talking to him suggests that this was a significant emotional trigger. Maybe she felt rejected not just once, but twice\u2014first by him turning her down, then by him engaging in self-pleasure which she might perceive as a lack of consideration for her. \n\nBut the author argues he didn't do anything wrong. However, in relationships, communication and consideration are key. Even if his actions are technically okay, the way they come off might not be considerate. The girlfriend might feel that he wasn't respecting her feelings or the emotional context of the situation. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If he was truthful about being out of the mood and then later satisfied his own needs without intentionally hurting her, maybe not. But the timing and the emotional impact might be the issue. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt hurt, which is valid. So maybe the author did something wrong in not considering how his actions might affect her emotionally, even if it wasn't a conscious intent to hurt. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions, while perhaps understandable, could be seen as insensitive to his partner's feelings, leading to her distress.\n"
