When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex and then later masturbated while she found out. Now she's upset and not talking to him. The author is confused and doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for two years, and they're both young, 21. They went home together, and the girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but he wasn't in the mood. That part seems okay. It's normal for people to have different moods and not feel like having sex sometimes. So turning her down isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThen, two hours later, he gets horny and decides to masturbate. The problem arises when his girlfriend walks in on him doing this. She reacts angrily, calls him a \"dick,\" and now they're having communication issues. The key question is whether the author did something wrong by masturbating after turning her down, especially when she found out.\n\nSo, is there a rule against a person in a relationship masturbating? I don't think so. Masturbation is a personal choice and a normal activity. However, the context here might matter. Did he do it in a private setting? If he was in his own room or a private space, then it's his privacy. But if he was in a shared space, like their room together, maybe there's an expectation of privacy or consideration for her feelings.\n\nBut the main issue is the girlfriend's reaction. Why is she so upset? Maybe she felt rejected when he turned her down and then seeing him masturbate made her feel even more devalued or used. Even if he wasn't in the wrong, her feelings are valid. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the act of masturbating after rejecting her could be seen as insensitive.\n\nAnother angle: in some relationships, there might be unspoken rules or expectations. If the girlfriend had certain expectations about intimacy and the author didn't communicate his needs, that could lead to misunderstandings. The author might not have considered her perspective. For example, if she was trying to connect with him and he didn't want to engage, then later engaging in self-pleasure might feel dismissive to her.\n\nAlso, the fact that she walked in on him might be a matter of privacy. Maybe he didn't consider that she might enter the room while he was doing something private. But that's more about privacy than morality.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. On one hand, he had the right to say no to sex and to masturbate. On the other hand, the timing and the girlfriend's feelings might mean that his actions were hurtful. The key here is communication. The author could have been more considerate of how his actions might affect her. If he had explained his feelings or made sure she wasn't upset, maybe things would have been different. But since he didn't, and she's now upset, he might be at fault for not considering her perspective, even if his actions weren't inherently wrong.\n\nIn relationships, actions that affect the other person's feelings are important. Even if something is technically okay, if it's causing emotional harm, it's worth addressing. So, the author might not be in the wrong in a strict sense, but he might have missed a chance to be understanding and communicative, which is part of being right in a relationship. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong, not just whether he could have been more considerate.\n\nIf the girlfriend is upset because he masturbated after rejecting her, maybe she feels that he was using her body or that he's not respecting her. But since they're in a committed relationship, mutual masturbation or self-pleasure isn't inherently disrespectful. Unless there's an agreement against it, which isn't mentioned here. Without that, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But the way he handled the situation might not be the best, leading to her upset. So, maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong (B), but he should talk to her to resolve the misunderstanding.\n"
