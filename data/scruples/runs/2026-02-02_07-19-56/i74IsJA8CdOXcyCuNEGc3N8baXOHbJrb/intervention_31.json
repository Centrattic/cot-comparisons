When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves turning down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbating while she's present, which led to her getting upset.\n\nFirst, the author turned down their girlfriend when she wanted to have sex. That part might be okay if they were honest about not being in the mood. However, the key issue here is that after turning her down, he later masturbated while she was in the house. When she walked in on him doing that, she reacted negatively.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, there's the aspect of respect and consideration. If the girlfriend had just been rejected, and then she enters the room to find her partner masturbating, it could feel disrespectful or dismissive. Even if he wasn't in the mood earlier, engaging in self-pleasure right after might make her feel unappreciated or like he's seeking satisfaction elsewhere when he didn't want to engage with her. \n\nIt's also about communication. The author didn't consider how his actions might affect her. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt hurt or embarrassed. The act of masturbating might have crossed a line in their specific relationship dynamics. Even if he didn't think about it beforehand, the fact that it caused her distress makes it something to address.\n\nAnother angle is the immediate aftermath. The author didn't seem to realize the impact of his actions until after she confronted him. That lack of awareness could contribute to the problem. In a healthy relationship, both partners need to be mindful of each other's feelings. If he had anticipated her feelings, he might have chosen a different time or place for that activity.\n\nHowever, the author might not have malicious intent. He wasn't trying to hurt her; he just wasn't in the mood earlier and later felt the need to relieve himself. But the issue is more about the context and how his actions were perceived. The girlfriend's emotional response is valid, so the author's actions, while perhaps understandable on a personal level, might have been inconsiderate in the situation.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions likely contributed to the girlfriend's upset. He might have been in the wrong by not being considerate of her feelings in that moment. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
