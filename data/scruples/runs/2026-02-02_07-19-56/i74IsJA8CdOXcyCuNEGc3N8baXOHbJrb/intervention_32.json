When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they turned down their girlfriend for sex when she initiated, and then later masturbated while she walked in on them. Now she's upset and not talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The writer said they weren't in the mood when she initiated, which is a common situation. But then, after turning her down, they masturbated. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about the fact that he turned her down and then immediately went to get his own release. That might make her feel rejected or not considered. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If one person is not in the mood, it's important to be considerate of the other's feelings. Maybe the girlfriend felt that by turning her down and then later taking care of his own needs, he wasn't respecting her. She might feel that he's being selfish or not acknowledging her desire for intimacy. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was using a laptop during masturbation could be a point. Maybe she saw him using her computer or something, but that might be a minor detail. The main issue is the rejection and then seeking his own satisfaction, which could be hurtful. \n\nI think the key here is about mutual respect and understanding each other's feelings. The writer didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but in the context of a relationship, actions can affect the partner's emotions. If she wanted to be intimate and he wasn't open to it but then went to satisfy himself, that could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because his actions could be perceived as disrespectful to his girlfriend's feelings. He should have considered her perspective and maybe communicated better or found a way to address his own needs without making her feel rejected. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
