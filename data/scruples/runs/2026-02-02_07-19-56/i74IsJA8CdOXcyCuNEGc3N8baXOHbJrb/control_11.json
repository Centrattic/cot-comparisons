When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex and later masturbated while she was in the same house. She got upset when she walked in on him. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, turning down a partner for sex isn't inherently wrong. People have different moods and needs, and communication is key. The author said he wasn't in the mood, so that's a reasonable response. However, the next part is about him masturbating while using the laptop. The girlfriend might feel hurt because he was intimate with himself instead of engaging with her. Maybe she feels rejected or that his actions are a sign of disrespect, especially right after she was turned down. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nHe didn't do anything illegal or unethical, just acted on his own needs. The problem here is more about the girlfriend's feelings and how the situation was handled. The author might not have considered her perspective, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. It's a communication issue. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action itself isn't wrong, but the girlfriend's reaction is about her feelings and expectations. However, some might argue that using a laptop could imply a lack of discretion or consideration, but that's a stretch. The main issue is the girlfriend's perception and the lack of communication. So the author isn't in the wrong, answer B.\n"
