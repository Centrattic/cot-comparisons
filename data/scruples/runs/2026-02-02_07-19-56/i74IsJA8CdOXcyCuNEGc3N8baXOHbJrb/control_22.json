When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on him. She got upset and isn't talking to him now. He's confused because he doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The couple has been together for two years, both 21. He said no to sex, which is his right. Then he masturbated, which is also a personal choice. However, the girlfriend walked in during his masturbation, which caused conflict. The main issue here is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nTurning down sex is a common thing in relationships. People have different moods and needs. So refusing isn't inherently wrong. Masturbating is a personal activity, but the context matters. If he was in a private space, it's fine. But maybe the girlfriend felt betrayed because he turned her down and then immediately masturbated, which could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong. She's upset and not talking to him. The question is whether the author's actions crossed a line. Some might argue that after saying no to her, he did something that could be perceived as prioritizing his own needs over hers, leading to hurt feelings. Others might say that masturbation is a normal activity and he wasn't wrong for doing it after rejecting her.\n\nBut in relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend might have felt unappreciated or that her needs were being ignored. The fact that he didn't consider her feelings when he chose to masturbate after turning her down could be the issue. Even if he didn't mean to, the action might have come off as insensitive.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions, while not illegal, could be seen as disrespectful in the context of the relationship. Alternatively, if it's about personal choice, then B. But given the girlfriend's emotional response, it's more about how his actions affected her, making A the likely answer.\n"
