When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and then masturbating when she found out.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has been together for two years, both 21. She wanted to have sex, but he wasn't in the mood. He turned her down, then later masturbated while using his laptop. She walked in, got upset, called him a dick, and hasn't talked to him much since. He's confused because he doesn't feel he did anything wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and boundaries. When someone declines a request for intimacy, it's important to consider how they communicate that. The author said he wasn't in the mood, which is valid. But maybe the way he handled it could be better? But the user isn't blaming him for turning her down.\n\nThen he masturbated, which is a personal choice. However, doing it while using the laptop might be something that could be a privacy issue. If she walked in on him, maybe she felt betrayed or disrespected because she wasn't aware he was doing so. Even if he turned her down earlier, she might have felt that his masturbation in her presence was dismissive or hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong. She's upset and not talking to him. The author is asking if he's in the wrong. The question is whether his actions were inappropriate. The act of masturbating itself isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. If they were in a situation where she expected intimacy and he then chose to masturbate, she might feel rejected or that he's being insincere by not communicating his needs better.\n\nAlso, the fact that she walked in on him might have made her feel like he wasn't respecting her boundaries or that he was hiding something. There might be an issue of trust here. Even if he didn't do anything illegal or unethical, the way he handled the situation could have hurt her feelings. Maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings and their relationship dynamics.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author's actions were his personal choice, and he had the right to make that decision. However, in a relationship, personal actions can affect the other person. If he knew she was upset, even if she didn't say so, maybe he should have been more sensitive. But he might not have known she was upset yet.\n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's reaction is maybe over the top. The author didn't do anything to intentionally hurt her, but he might have failed to consider how she'd perceive his actions. So, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. In some perspectives, the author is not wrong for making a personal choice, but in a relationship, actions can have consequences. Since the question is whether he is in the wrong, and the answer is A or B, I think the answer leans towards B (No), because he didn't do anything malicious, but there's a possibility that he could have handled it better. However, given the information, the answer is B.\n"
