When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the author turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on him. Now she's upset.\n\nFirst, the author said no to sex because they weren't in the mood. That part seems okay, right? People have different moods, and it's normal to say no sometimes. But then, two hours later, the author masturbated. The girlfriend walked in while he was doing it and got really upset. Why would that make her upset? Maybe she felt hurt or jealous? Or maybe she thought it was disrespectful?\n\nWait, the author is with their girlfriend. Masturbating while she's in the house might not be inherently wrong, but doing it in a room where she could walk in might be a privacy issue. Also, maybe the girlfriend felt ignored or rejected after he turned her down earlier. Then, when she sees him getting off by himself, it might make her feel like he's not satisfied with the relationship or is being unfaithful even though he's not.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? They didn't do anything wrong, like cheating or hurting her. They just said no to sex and later satisfied themselves. Maybe the problem is the girlfriend's reaction, but the author might have handled it differently. Like, maybe they should have considered her feelings more and not done it in a shared space. Or maybe the author should have communicated better, explaining that they were just dealing with their own needs and not being unfaithful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to their own body and sexual needs. But the way it happened\u2014her walking in on it and the context of her being rejected earlier\u2014could have been a trigger for her. The author might not have realized how that action could be perceived as dismissive or hurtful. So maybe the author is not wrong, but they could have been more considerate. \n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? If the answer is A, yes, then it's because they ignored her feelings or acted inconsiderately. If B, no, then it's because they have the right to their own actions. I think this is a bit of a gray area, but since the girlfriend is upset and the author's action of masturbating while she's in the house could be seen as insensitive, maybe the author is partially at fault. But maybe not entirely. Hmm. I'm leaning towards A because the context of the rejection and the timing might have made the action more hurtful, even if unintentionally.\n"
