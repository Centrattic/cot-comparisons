When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and then masturbating, which led to her being upset.\n\nFirst, the author turned down sex when his girlfriend initiated it. He says he wasn't in the mood, which is a common reason. But then later, he masturbated while she was in the house. When she walked in, she got upset. The key points here are communication and respect.\n\nTurning down sex when not interested is okay as long as it's communicated respectfully. The author did say he wasn't feeling it, so that part might be fine. But then, masturbating in a shared space, especially after rejecting her, could be seen as insensitive. It might make her feel rejected or unattractive, even if the author didn't mean it that way. Also, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt hurt or embarrassed. The author might have failed to consider her feelings in that moment. So, there's a possibility he's in the wrong for not being considerate enough after the rejection.\n"
