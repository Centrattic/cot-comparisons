When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and then masturbating, which led to her getting upset.\n\nFirst, the author turned down his girlfriend's attempt to have sex. He said he wasn't in the mood, which is a common reason. That part doesn't seem inherently wrong. People have different moods and needs, and communication is key in relationships. So refusing sex when not in the mood is generally acceptable, especially if done respectfully. He mentioned he's been with her for two years, so maybe they have a history of understanding each other's moods.\n\nThen, after she said no, he masturbated. The issue here is that she walked in on him doing this. The problem arises from the context: she was upset that he turned her down, then he goes to masturbate, and she might feel ignored or not considered. The act of masturbating after refusing her might be seen as dismissive, even if it's just to his own needs. But is that the author's fault if he's not in the mood for her but still has his own needs? Maybe he could have considered her feelings more, but he might not have intended to hurt her.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling him a dick and not talking to him. That suggests she's hurt. Maybe she felt rejected and then further ignored when he went to masturbate, which could be interpreted as not valuing her enough to wait or talk about it. But the author might not have considered her perspective. Did he communicate properly? He said he wasn't in the mood, but then when he was, he did it alone, which might have made her feel like her feelings were disregarded.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the communication and context. If he had a history of not being considerate or dismissing her feelings, maybe. But from the given info, he tried to be respectful by turning her down. However, the act of masturbating after she tried to initiate might come off as insensitive, especially if she's feeling hurt from being rejected. The key point is communication. If he had explained that he needed time and maybe discussed it with her instead of doing it when she might walk in, that would be better. But he didn't do that. So maybe he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings in that moment.\n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend's reaction might be over the top, but the question is about the author's responsibility. The act of masturbating isn't inherently wrong, but the context and her feelings matter. If he had a history of similar issues, that's different. But based on the current info, maybe the author is partially at fault for not being more considerate in his actions after refusing her. So answer A.\n"
