When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend for sex and then masturbating while she was around. \n\nFirst, the situation: They got home early, she wanted sex, he wasn't in the mood and said no. Then later, he masturbated and she walked in on him. She got upset, called him a dick, and now they're not talking well.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author said no to sex because he wasn't in the mood. That's his right, right? People can have different moods. But then he masturbated while she was in the house. Maybe she felt hurt because he turned her down and then immediately went to get his own pleasure? That could be a problem. Maybe she felt rejected or unappreciated. \n\nBut does that make him wrong? If he's in his own home, he can masturbate if he wants, right? Unless they have some agreement about privacy or boundaries. If she walked in on him, maybe he didn't take her feelings into account. Like, he rejected her and then she might have been trying to be understanding, but then he went and did something that might make her feel worse. \n\nAlso, the way she reacted\u2014calling him a dick and being upset. Maybe she's hurt that he didn't consider her feelings. If he's okay with it, but she's not, then communication is a big issue here. The author might be in the wrong if he ignored her feelings or if there was a lack of communication about their boundaries. \n\nBut on the other hand, he didn't do anything against her. He's allowed to have his own needs. Maybe the problem is more about her reaction than his actions. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. So, if he had a legitimate reason for not being in the mood, then he's not wrong for saying no. But if he didn't consider her feelings and just went ahead to masturbate when she was around, maybe he's at fault for not being sensitive. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was visibly upset after and is now distant. He might need to talk to her and explain his side, but the question is whether he was wrong. \n\nI think the key here is about mutual respect and communication. If he said no to her and then did something that she found hurtful, even if it's his right, maybe he should have been more considerate. So, maybe answer A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't take her feelings into account. But others might say no because he has the right to his own actions. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nBut in relationships, considering the partner's feelings is important. So even if he's not technically wrong, he might be in the wrong for not being considerate. So leaning towards A.\n"
