When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this Reddit-style post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user, who's in a 2-year relationship with his girlfriend, both 21, got home early from class. His girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. Then, a couple of hours later, he masturbated while watching something on his laptop. His girlfriend walked in during this, got upset, called him a \"dick,\" and hasn't been talking to him much since, just yes/no answers and seems visibly upset. He's confused because he doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He turned her down for sex when she wanted it, which might have been a disappointment for her, but he was honest. Then, later, he masturbated, which is a private act. The key here is whether his actions were respectful towards her and if they crossed any boundaries.\n\nMasturbating in front of someone, especially a partner, could be seen as violating their privacy. Even if it's just him doing it and not showing it to her, the act of doing it in her presence might be considered inappropriate if it's a private space. However, if he was in a room and she walked in unexpectedly, maybe it's less about his actions and more about her reaction. But then again, if they're in a relationship, mutual respect and communication are important. \n\nDid he do anything to intentionally hurt her feelings? He turned down sex once, which is a normal part of relationships. Then he masturbated, which is a personal choice. However, if his girlfriend walked in on him doing it, maybe she felt hurt or disrespected because he was engaging in a sexual act while she was upset about being turned down earlier. \n\nBut wait, did he do anything wrong by masturbating after refusing her? If he's not in the mood, he can't be forced into anything. However, the act of masturbating while she's around might be seen as insensitive. Maybe she felt he was prioritizing his own needs over hers, especially after declining her earlier. \n\nAlso, the fact that she walked in on him might have made her feel embarrassed or disrespected. Maybe she felt like he wasn't being considerate of her feelings. If they were in a situation where she was expecting intimacy but he instead turned to solo activities, that could be a point of contention. \n\nBut is that his fault? If he's honest about not being in the mood, and then later does his own thing, is that wrong? Or is it a communication issue? Maybe they need to talk about expectations. If he had communicated that he needed some time alone after turning her down, maybe she wouldn't have walked in. But since she did walk in, perhaps she had a right to feel upset because she saw him engaging in a sexual act that she might have wanted to participate in instead.\n\nOn the other hand, masturbation is a normal and healthy activity. He didn't have to have sex with her, so why is it wrong to take care of his own needs? Maybe she's mad because she felt rejected and then he \"replaced\" her with self-pleasure. But that's a bit of a projection. \n\nI think the main issue is the privacy aspect. If he was in a shared space and she walked in, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings. If he was in his own room, maybe it's different. The location isn't specified, but the act of masturbating in her presence, even if she walked in, might have been a boundary she didn't expect. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he wasn't in the wrong for turning her down, then maybe his masturbation isn't inherently wrong. However, the timing and context might matter. Since she was upset about being turned down earlier, and then he was doing something she might perceive as using her rejection as a reason to masturbate, that could be hurtful. \n\nBut again, masturbation is a personal choice. Unless there's a prior agreement or open communication about such things, it's hard to say he's at fault. He might not be in the wrong for either action, but the lack of communication and consideration for her feelings could be the issue. \n\nIn relationships, actions can have emotional impacts. Even if what he did isn't technically wrong, the way it made her feel is important. Maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings by not doing it so soon after turning her down, but it's not like he's obligated to avoid that. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he didn't force anything on her, turned down sex when she wanted it, and then engaged in a normal activity. However, the situation requires better communication and understanding from both sides. But strictly on whether he's in the wrong, it's probably not A.\n"
