When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple of 21-year-olds who have been together for two years. The guy turned down his girlfriend's attempt to have sex because he wasn't in the mood. Later, he masturbated, and when she walked in on him, she got upset and hasn't been talking to him since.\n\nFirst, turning down sex when a partner is interested in it can be a sensitive issue. The guy says he wasn't in the mood, which is a common reason. However, the next part is where things get complicated. He then masturbated using his laptop, which implies he was using explicit material. The girlfriend's reaction was strong\u2014calling him a \"dick\" and being upset. The key here is the context of her walking in on him using porn or masturbating, which might have made her feel hurt or embarrassed.\n\nNow, considering communication in a relationship, the guy might be in the wrong if he didn't consider her feelings. Even though he was in the right to say no to sex initially, the act of masturbating in her presence, especially using a laptop (which often involves explicit content), could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The girlfriend might feel that he prioritized his own needs without considering her feelings, especially after she tried to initiate intimacy. Also, if they were in a private space, using a laptop to watch pornography could be an invasion of privacy or a breach of trust, depending on the couple's dynamics and previous agreements.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt hurt or upset, which indicates that the act of masturbating in her presence might have crossed a line. The guy might not realize that his actions, even if he felt entitled to them, could be perceived as inconsiderate. In a healthy relationship, partners should communicate their boundaries and respect each other's feelings. If the guy didn't consider that she might not want to see him masturbating, especially after a sexual rejection, he could be at fault for not being mindful of her emotional state.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that he used a laptop implies the use of pornography, which some people might find uncomfortable. If the couple hasn't discussed boundaries regarding pornography use in the home, this could be a point of contention. The girlfriend's visible upset and withdrawal suggest that her feelings were hurt, which the guy might need to address by apologizing and discussing boundaries moving forward.\n\nIn conclusion, while the guy had the right to say no to sex, his subsequent actions might have been inconsiderate, leading to the girlfriend's upset. The key is whether he respected her feelings in the situation. The answer likely leans towards him being in the wrong because of the lack of consideration for her feelings in his private actions.\n"
