When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend and then masturbating when she walked in. \n\nFirst, the guy turned down sex because he wasn't in the mood. That part seems okay. It's normal to not want sex sometimes, especially in a two-year relationship. He communicated that he wasn't feeling it, so no problem there.\n\nNext, he masturbated a few hours later. The issue is that when he was doing it, his girlfriend walked in. She was upset and called him a dick. Now, the question is whether he's at fault here. \n\nMasturbating isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. If he was using a device (like a laptop) that might involve explicit content, maybe she felt embarrassed or hurt. Also, not considering her feelings by just walking out when she came in could be an issue. Maybe she was trying to connect and he wasn't present. \n\nBut wait, he was in his own home. If he was in a private area, maybe she shouldn't have walked in unannounced. However, the fact that he was using a laptop might mean he was in a room where she expected privacy, but maybe they have an understanding about that. \n\nHer reaction seems strong. She's not talking to him and is visibly upset. That suggests she felt hurt or disrespected. The guy might not see the issue, but maybe he should consider that his actions made her uncomfortable. Even if he's innocent, the situation could be handled better. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's possible he wasn't intending to offend, but the act of masturbating while they're in the same house, especially after turning down sex, might be seen as dismissive. Alternatively, if he was in a private space and she walked in without knocking, maybe she's at fault. \n\nBut the key point is her reaction. If she's upset, he should acknowledge her feelings and talk about it rather than justifying his actions. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but he could have handled it more sensitively. The answer might be B (No), but with a note that communication is important.\n"
