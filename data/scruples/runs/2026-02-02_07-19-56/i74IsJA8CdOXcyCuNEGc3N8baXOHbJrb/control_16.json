When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he turned down his girlfriend's attempt to have sex because he wasn't in the mood. Then later, when he decided to masturbate, she walked in and got upset. Now she's not talking to him.\n\nFirst, turning down sex when she's trying to initiate\u2014it's his right to not be in the mood, right? As long as he's communicated that clearly. The user says he wasn't feeling it, so maybe that's okay. But maybe there's more context? Like, if she was trying to initiate often and he's always turning her down, but the user says they've been together two years, so maybe it's an occasional thing. \n\nThen he masturbates after turning her down. She walks in, gets angry. Why is she upset? Maybe she feels rejected again, especially if she was trying to be intimate and he's then using her body for his pleasure. It might come off as disrespectful or dismissive. Even if he's not cheating, the act of masturbating after refusing her might feel hurtful. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything illegal, but in relationships, communication and consideration matter. If he didn't mention the masturbation beforehand, maybe she felt blindsided. Also, if she walked in on him doing it, that's awkward, but maybe he should have been more discreet. \n\nThe key points: He refused sex due to not being in the mood, which is his choice. Then later, when he's alone, he masturbates. She walks in and gets upset. The problem might be the sequence of events\u2014after rejecting her, he uses masturbation, which could make her feel like he's prioritizing his own needs without considering hers. Maybe she felt like he was being inconsiderate or even a bit cruel by then engaging in self-pleasure when she was rejected earlier. \n\nBut again, the act of masturbation isn't wrong. However, the way it was handled might have hurt her feelings. Maybe he should have considered her feelings more and discussed why she was upset instead of just doing it. The fact that she's now distant suggests that his action caused emotional harm. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider how his masturbation might affect her after turning her down. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's allowed to have his own needs. But the key is the relationship dynamics. If he hurt her feelings by acting on his own needs immediately after rejecting her intimacy, that's a breach of empathy. Hence, A.\n"
