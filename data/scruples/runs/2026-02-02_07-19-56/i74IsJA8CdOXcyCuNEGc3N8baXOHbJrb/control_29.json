When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend's attempt at sex, then later masturbated while she walked in and got upset.\n\nFirst, turning down a partner's sexual advance isn't inherently wrong. People have different moods and needs, and communication is key. The author said he wasn't in the mood, which is a valid reason. So far, no problem there.\n\nThen, he masturbated later. The girlfriend walked in, saw him doing this, and got angry. The question is whether the author did something wrong here. If he was alone and chose to masturbate, that's his personal choice. Unless the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with him masturbating when she's around, it's not necessarily wrong. However, maybe the context matters. If they're in a situation where privacy is expected, and she walked in unexpectedly, that's more about the girlfriend's reaction than his action. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about the perception. The girlfriend might feel rejected or that he's prioritizing his own needs over hers. Even if he didn't do anything wrong technically, the way the situation played out might have hurt her feelings. She might feel that declining sex and then later choosing to masturbate (especially if she was in a similar mood?) could be seen as insensitive. However, the author didn't mention any prior discussion about this. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction seems strong. She called him a name and hasn't been talking. The author might need to consider her feelings and communicate better, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. The key factors are communication and mutual respect. If the author respected her feelings by declining and then acted on his own needs when he wanted, that's his right. Unless there's an agreement about such matters, it's hard to say he's wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but there's room for better communication.\n"
