When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated with a laptop, which she walked in on. Now she's upset.\n\nFirst, the author said no to sex when she wanted to have it. That could be a problem. Even if he wasn't in the mood, communication is key. Maybe she had a need that wasn't met, but he's not obligated to have sex when he doesn't want to. But maybe he should have been more considerate.\n\nThen he masturbated using a laptop, which I assume means watching porn. The girlfriend walked in and was upset. If they're in a committed relationship, watching porn might be a boundary issue. Some people are okay with it, others aren't. If she walked in and reacted that strongly, maybe he should have considered her feelings by not doing it in a place where she could walk in. Privacy is important here. Using a laptop in a shared space without ensuring privacy could be a mistake.\n\nThe key points are: turning down sex (not necessarily wrong, but could affect her feelings) and the masturbation incident. The latter might be where he's in the wrong. If they're in a relationship where such actions are a no-go, then yes, he's in the wrong. But if she didn't previously express discomfort with his porn use, maybe not. However, using a laptop in a shared space without privacy could be seen as disrespectful. So I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because of the second part. The first part is more about personal choice, but the second part crosses into respect and privacy issues in a relationship.\n"
