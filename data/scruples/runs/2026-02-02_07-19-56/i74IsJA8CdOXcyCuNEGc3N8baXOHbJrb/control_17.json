When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend's attempt at intimacy and later masturbated while she was nearby. When she walked in, she got upset and hasn't been talking to him since.\n\nFirst, the author said \"no\" to sex when their girlfriend wanted it, which is their right. But then, shortly after, they masturbated using their laptop. The girlfriend's reaction was strong\u2014calling him a dick and being visibly upset. The key here is whether the author's actions after saying no are what's causing the conflict.\n\nMasturbating after refusing sex isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. If the girlfriend was upset that he turned her down and then he used her laptop to masturbate, that could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Maybe she felt he was prioritizing his own needs without considering her feelings. Also, using her property for that might add to her resentment.\n\nThe author might not see the issue, thinking he had the right to say no and then take care of his own needs. However, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She might feel rejected when he says no, and then seeing him masturbate could make her feel even more unappreciated or unimportant. Even if he used a different device, the act of masturbating right after turning her down could be hurtful, regardless of the method.\n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend felt disrespected or that her rejection was being ignored. The author might not have communicated his needs clearly or considered how his actions affect her. Even if he didn't do anything explicitly wrong, the way he handled the situation might have hurt her feelings. So, while he's not necessarily in the wrong legally or morally, he might be at fault in terms of empathy and communication.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his actions could have been inconsiderate, even if they weren't strictly unethical. The key is the impact on his partner's feelings, which he may have overlooked.\n"
