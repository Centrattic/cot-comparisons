When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and later masturbating, which led to her getting upset.\n\nFirst, turning down sex when the partner is interested is a common situation. The key here is communication. The author said he wasn't in the mood and that's okay. But then, later he masturbated with the laptop, which the girlfriend saw. She reacted strongly, calling him a dick and not talking to him. \n\nNow, why would she be upset? Maybe because she felt rejected again, even though he had already said no once. She might have been trying to get physical attention again, and instead, he used a substitute with the laptop. That could feel like a double rejection. Also, the fact that he used the laptop might make her feel replaced or objectified. \n\nThe author doesn't see why she's upset, but her feelings are valid. Even if he didn't do anything illegal, emotional hurt is real. The problem here is that he didn't consider her feelings after the initial refusal. Masturbating while she's around might come off as dismissive. \n\nIn a relationship, actions can affect emotions. The girlfriend might feel like he's treating her as a substitute, which can lead to insecurity and resentment. The author should have been more considerate of her feelings in that moment. \n\nSo, even though he didn't force her or do anything wrong per se, his actions could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
