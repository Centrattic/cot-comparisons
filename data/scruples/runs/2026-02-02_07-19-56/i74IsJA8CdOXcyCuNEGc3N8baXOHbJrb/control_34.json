When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on him and got upset. The girlfriend is now upset and not talking much.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said no to sex because they weren't in the mood, which is a common and valid reason. Then, after some time, they masturbated using their laptop, which the girlfriend walked in on. She's upset about that.\n\nNow, considering their relationship dynamics. They've been together for two years, both 21. The author didn't do anything wrong by saying no to sex. That's their right. Masturbating isn't inherently wrong, but the context here might matter. When the girlfriend walked in, the author was using the laptop, which might imply they were in a shared space and didn't consider her privacy. But wait, the author was in their own home, so maybe it's about mutual privacy expectations.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from feeling hurt or rejected. Maybe she felt the author was prioritizing personal gratification over their relationship. But the author didn't do anything illegal or unethical. The real issue might be communication. The author didn't explain their actions, leading to misunderstanding. However, the act of masturbating at home isn't wrong. The girlfriend's anger might be about the timing or the lack of communication about boundaries regarding privacy.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the girlfriend felt the author was being inconsiderate by not being mindful of her presence. If the author used the laptop in a room they knew she might enter, that's a privacy issue. But the author might not have known. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions, not the girlfriend's reaction. Since the author didn't do anything that violates the relationship's norms (assuming mutual consent and privacy isn't a prior issue), the answer might be B. But maybe the girlfriend's feelings matter here. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing, not emotional impact unless it's a clear breach.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for saying no to sex or masturbating at home. The girlfriend's reaction is emotional but doesn't make the author wrong. Unless there's an unspoken agreement about privacy, which isn't mentioned here. Since the scenario doesn't indicate a prior issue with privacy or boundaries, the answer is B.\n"
