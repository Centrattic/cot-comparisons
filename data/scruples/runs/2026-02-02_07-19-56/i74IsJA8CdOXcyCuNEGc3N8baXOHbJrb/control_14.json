When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend's attempt to have sex, then later masturbated in front of her when she walked in, which upset her. She's now upset and not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for two years, both 21. The author said no to sex because he wasn't in the mood. That seems okay; it's common to not be in the mood sometimes. But then, when he masturbated later, she saw him doing it. Maybe she felt rejected or hurt because he turned her down and then immediately went to another sexual activity. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't do anything illegal, but maybe there's an emotional aspect. When he was done with her, he then went to masturbate, which could be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend might feel that he's not respecting her feelings or that he's prioritizing his own needs over hers. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if they had an understanding that he wouldn't masturbate after turning her down, then he might be wrong. But if there's no prior agreement, maybe it's not his fault. However, the act of masturbating in a room where the girlfriend might walk in could be considered inconsiderate. He might have known she was nearby and didn't take precautions. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She might feel hurt and think that his actions are a sign of not being interested in her or respecting their relationship. The author not seeing the problem might indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings and his actions could have been inconsiderate, even if unintentionally. He should have discussed his actions or been more mindful of her presence.\n"
