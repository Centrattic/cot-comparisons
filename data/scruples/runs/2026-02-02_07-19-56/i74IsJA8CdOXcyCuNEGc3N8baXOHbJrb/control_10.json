When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated in front of her when she walked in, leading to her being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was not in the mood, so he declined sex. That part seems fine\u2014communicating that he wasn't interested. But then later, he masturbated and she walked in. The problem here might be about privacy and respect. Even if he was alone, if she walked in, maybe he should have been more considerate about his actions in a shared space. If they live together, there's an expectation of privacy, but also respecting each other's boundaries. However, if he was in his own room and she entered without permission, that's a different angle. But the description doesn't specify where this happened.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. She reacted strongly, calling him a \"dick\" and not talking to him. He might not realize how his actions made her feel. Maybe she felt he was being disrespectful or dismissive. Even if he wasn't doing anything illegal, the way he handled it might have been insensitive. Maybe he should have been more discreet or considered her feelings if she walked in. Alternatively, maybe she's overreacting, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe fact that they've been together for two years suggests they should understand each other's boundaries. If he was masturbating and she walked in, is that a private activity he should be doing without others seeing? If he was using a laptop, maybe there were explicit content, which she might not be comfortable with. Even if it's his right to do so in his own home, the manner in which it was done could be problematic. \n\nBut then again, if she walked into his room without permission, maybe that's also an issue. The situation isn't entirely clear. However, the main point is that after turning her down, he then engaged in self-pleasure, which might have been perceived as rejecting her or not respecting her. She might feel that he's not considering her feelings, especially if she was still in the house. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe it's a mix of both. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the masturbation part when she walked in. If he was in a shared space and she walked in, maybe he should have been more discreet. But if it was his private space, perhaps her entering was the issue. The answer might hinge on whether his actions were respectful in their shared living situation. \n\nAlso, the emotional response from her is significant. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, his actions had a negative impact. So maybe he's at least partially responsible. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because even if he wasn't doing anything wrong legally, he might have been insensitive. But others might say it's not his fault if he was in his own space. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nLooking up similar situations, often the advice is about communication. Since he turned her down earlier, maybe she was feeling rejected and then this incident made it worse. His masturbation after declining her could be seen as dismissive. So perhaps he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings more, leading to her upset reaction.\n"
