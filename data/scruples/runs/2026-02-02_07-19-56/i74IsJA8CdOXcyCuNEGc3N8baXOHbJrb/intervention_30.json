When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they turned down their girlfriend for sex and then later masturbated while she walked in and got upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been together for two years, both 21. The author said no to sex when she initiated, which is their right. But then later, when she wasn't around, he masturbated. The girlfriend walked in during this and was upset. \n\nWhy would she be upset? Maybe she felt rejected when he said no, and then seeing him masturbate might make her feel like he's not considering her feelings. It could be perceived as disrespect, even if he wasn't trying to be. Maybe she felt he was using her for his own needs without her consent, or that he wasn't being honest about his actions. \n\nBut the author didn't hide it from her. He was in the room, and she walked in. So maybe the issue is that he didn't consider how she might feel if she saw him doing that. Even if it's his choice to masturbate, doing it in a shared space without privacy might be an issue. \n\nAlso, communication is key here. When he turned her down, maybe he should have checked in with her feelings instead of just saying no. Then, when he masturbated, if there was a history of discussing such things, maybe that's another factor. But the problem might be that she felt hurt by his rejection and then the act of him masturbating made her feel worse, thinking he wasn't respecting her. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he didn't force himself on her when she initiated, which is good. But his actions later might have been insensitive. He should have considered her feelings. Maybe he didn't realize the emotional impact of his actions. So, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective after turning her down and then doing something that made her feel disrespected. \n\nBut then again, masturbation is a personal choice. However, doing it in front of her when she's not expecting it could be the issue. If they had a prior agreement about privacy or if there's a different dynamic, that's a factor. Without more context, it's possible that the author's actions, while not illegal or unethical in a strict sense, could be seen as insensitive. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the lack of consideration for her feelings in the situation.\n"
