When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex and later masturbated while she walked in and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said no to sex because they weren't in the mood. That part is normal; people have different moods and it's their right to say no. The girlfriend tried to initiate, and he was honest about not being up for it. So far, he's not wrong for that.\n\nThen, two hours later, he decides to masturbate. He uses his laptop, which might be part of the issue. When he's in the middle of this, she walks in and reacts strongly. She's upset, calls him a \"dick,\" and is now only giving yes/no answers. The author is confused because he doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nNow, considering cultural and relationship norms. In some contexts, using a laptop during masturbation might imply watching something she's uncomfortable with, but the question doesn't specify that. The main issue could be about privacy. If he was in a room where she could walk in unexpectedly, maybe he didn't consider the timing or location. But he might have thought he was in a private space.\n\nAnother angle is about consent and boundaries. The author wasn't in the mood earlier, but later he was. Masturbation is a normal activity, but if he did it in a shared space without considering her feelings, that could be a problem. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also important. If they were in a situation where privacy isn't guaranteed, maybe there's some mutual responsibility.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend might feel rejected when he turned her down and then felt that he was using her for sexual satisfaction later. But the author didn't do anything illegal or necessarily disrespectful unless there's a specific agreement they had about privacy or sharing devices.\n\nIn terms of general advice, turning down sex is okay, and masturbation is a personal choice. However, if the girlfriend walked in unexpectedly and felt violated, maybe the author could have been more considerate of the timing or location. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the story doesn't mention any explicit rule about not using the laptop or being private, it's hard to say he's wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own feelings of rejection or insecurity rather than his wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but there's room for discussion about communication and privacy. However, based on the given info, there's no clear violation of agreed-upon boundaries, so the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
