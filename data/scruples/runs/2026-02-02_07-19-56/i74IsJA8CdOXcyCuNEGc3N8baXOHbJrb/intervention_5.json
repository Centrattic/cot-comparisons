When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is whether answer A (Yes) or B (No) is correct.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she was in the house. When she walked in on him, she got upset and stopped talking to him beyond yes/no answers. The author is confused and doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Refusing to have sex when she initiated, 2) Masturbating while she was nearby, and 3) Her reaction to seeing him masturbate.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, turning down sex when a partner is trying to initiate it. The author says he wasn't in the mood. In a two-year relationship, it's normal for there to be times when one isn't interested. However, consistently turning down a partner can be an issue. But in this case, it was a one-time instance. So maybe that's not the main problem here.\n\nThen, the author masturbated while she was in the house. The girlfriend walked in on him. The act of masturbating itself isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. If she walked in on him, maybe she felt disrespected or that he prioritized his own needs over her feelings. Also, using a laptop during masturbation might suggest watching something that the girlfriend might not be comfortable with. If the content is something they've discussed as off-limits, that's a problem. But the author doesn't mention that.\n\nAnother angle is the girlfriend's reaction. She called him a \"dick\" and stopped talking to him. Her emotional response is significant. Maybe she felt hurt because he turned her down and then immediately engaged in self-pleasure, which could be perceived as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean to, his actions might have sent a message that his needs are more important than hers.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he didn't do anything wrong. He wasn't in the mood, and then later had a natural reaction to being horny. But in relationships, communication and consideration for each other's feelings are important. Even if the act of masturbation isn't wrong, the timing and context could have been handled better. The author could have perhaps been more discreet or checked in with her before doing so, especially since she was nearby.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's upset reaction might stem from feeling rejected not just by the refusal of sex but by the subsequent action of masturbating while she was in the house. It could be seen as a lack of respect for her presence or intimacy. Even if the author didn't have ill intent, the action had a negative impact on her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because his actions, while not inherently unethical on their own, were insensitive given the situation. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and the author didn't consider how his masturbation might affect her emotionally. The key here is that the problem isn't the act itself but the impact it had on the relationship. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the action was done without considering the girlfriend's feelings, leading to her distress.\n"
