When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex and later masturbated, and she got really upset. So, first, I need to consider the context.\n\nThey've been together for two years, both 21. He said he wasn't in the mood, which he's allowed to do. It's important to respect each other's boundaries. Then, after she refused, he masturbated. Now, the girlfriend walked in on him and got angry. The key points here are consent and communication.\n\nMasturbating is a personal choice, but if they're in a relationship, maybe there's unspoken expectations. But the author didn't do anything wrong by just having sex with himself. The problem might be that he didn't communicate his actions, but does that make him wrong? Also, the girlfriend's reaction is intense. She might be feeling rejected or hurt because he turned her down and then masturbated, which could be seen as insensitive. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If they have an open relationship or agreed boundaries, maybe not. However, if they're monogamous, his action isn't inherently wrong. However, the way he did it might have caused her emotional pain. Maybe he didn't consider her feelings when he turned her down and then did it. But turning someone down isn't wrong. The masturbation itself isn't wrong unless there's a specific agreement. \n\nAlternatively, the girlfriend might feel disrespected if he used her rejection as a reason to masturbate. But the author didn't force anything. The main issue is the girlfriend's reaction, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. I think he's not in the wrong, but maybe he should talk to her to understand her feelings better. So the answer is B, No.\n"
