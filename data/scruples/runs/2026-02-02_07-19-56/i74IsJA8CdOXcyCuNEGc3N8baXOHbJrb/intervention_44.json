When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author turning down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbating while she was present, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author said he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. That part seems okay because it's common for people to not be in the mood at times. The problem arises when he later masturbates in front of her without considering her feelings. Even though he wasn't in the mood earlier, his actions after could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, especially if they made her feel embarrassed or hurt.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is significant here. She's upset, called him a \"dick,\" and stopped talking to him. Her feelings are valid, and the author might not have considered how his actions would affect her. Masturbating in her presence without discussing it could be a breach of intimacy or trust, depending on their relationship norms. The fact that she's visibly upset suggests that the author's actions crossed a line, even if he didn't intend to.\n\nThe author's defense is that he wasn't in the mood earlier, but that doesn't excuse the later action. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. The key issue here is the lack of communication about boundaries and being considerate of each other's feelings. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate his actions or consider her feelings when he masturbated in front of her. Even if he didn't do anything wrong in his eyes, his actions had a negative impact, which is why the girlfriend is upset.\n"
