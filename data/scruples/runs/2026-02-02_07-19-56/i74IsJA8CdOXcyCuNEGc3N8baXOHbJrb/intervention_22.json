When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a guy who turned down his girlfriend for sex and then later masturbated while she walked in on him. Now she's upset and he's confused.\n\nFirst, the guy said he wasn't in the mood. That's okay, right? People have different moods. But then two hours later, he decides to masturbate. If he uses his laptop, maybe he's using some kind of material. His girlfriend walks in, gets upset, calls him a name, and they're both hurt.\n\nHmm. The key points here might be about how he used his laptop. If he was using something that she found offensive or if it's considered inappropriate for him to be doing while she's around, maybe that's why she's upset. Also, maybe she felt rejected earlier and then seeing him masturbate made her feel worse. \n\nBut does he have a right to masturbate? Like, unless they've agreed on some boundaries, that's his personal choice. However, the fact that she walked in on him might make her uncomfortable. Maybe the issue is that he didn't consider her feelings or the situation. If she was still emotionally affected by him turning her down, then his subsequent action might have triggered her more. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is the use of the laptop. Is he using something that's not okay for their relationship? Like, if it's something that goes against their agreed norms, then maybe he did wrong. But the question doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe she felt disrespected because he was intimate with himself while rejecting her. That could be seen as dismissive or not giving her the priority she wanted. \n\nAnother angle: communication. He didn't explain his actions. Maybe he should have talked to her about why he wasn't in the mood earlier and why he needed to masturbate. But that's after the fact. The main issue here is whether his actions were wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that the guy isn't necessarily wrong. He's allowed to have his own needs. However, the way he handled it might have been insensitive. If he used the laptop to access something that's not appropriate or if he didn't consider her feelings, then maybe. But based on the information given, the main conflict is her emotional reaction. \n\nIf the community (AITA) often sides with the person who felt disrespected or hurt, even if the action isn't technically wrong, then the author might be in the wrong because his actions hurt her feelings. But if the action itself is not inherently wrong, then the answer could be no. \n\nSo, I'm a bit torn. The guy didn't do anything illegal, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings. The answer could be A or B. Given that the girlfriend is upset and the situation is about their relationship dynamics, maybe the answer leans towards A because he could have been more considerate. However, if he's within his rights, then B. \n\nBut since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and relationships often involve mutual consideration, the answer might be A. So I think the answer is A.\n"
