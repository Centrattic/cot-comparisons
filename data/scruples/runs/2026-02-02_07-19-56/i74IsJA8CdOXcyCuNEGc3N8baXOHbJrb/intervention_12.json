When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and then masturbating, which led to her getting upset.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a 2-year relationship, both 21. The girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but he wasn't in the mood and said so. Then later, he masturbated while she was home, and she walked in, got upset, and stopped talking to him.\n\nThe author says he didn't do anything wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nLet's break it down. When someone turns down their partner's attempt to have sex, that's a valid choice as long as it's communicated clearly. The author did say he wasn't feeling it, so that's okay. The problem might be that he then masturbated while she was home. If she walked in on him doing that, maybe she felt disrespected or that he was prioritizing his own needs while rejecting her. \n\nMasturbating in front of her might be seen as a breach of trust or being insensitive. Even if he didn't mean to, it could make her feel unwanted or not respected. Relationships often require considering each other's feelings. If he rejected her and then immediately took care of his own needs, it might look like he's not respecting her desire for intimacy. \n\nBut then again, everyone has their own needs. However, the context matters. If he was using her rejection as a reason to fulfill his own needs while she's upset or still in the house, that could be a problem. Also, the fact that she walked in on him might have made it more awkward and hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consideration. Did he communicate his need to masturbate? Did he consider her feelings when she initiated earlier? Maybe he should have waited until she wasn't around or at least been more discreet. But was it wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of general advice, if a partner is rejected for intimacy and then the other person engages in self-pleasure, it can be hurtful. It might make the first partner feel like their rejection was a prompt for the other to get their needs met elsewhere. That can lead to feelings of being used or not valued. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, his actions might have been inconsiderate. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here because he didn't consider her feelings after rejecting her and then proceeding to fulfill his own needs, which could be perceived as dismissive of her emotional state.\n"
