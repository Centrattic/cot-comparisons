When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend's attempt to have sex because they weren't in the mood. Then later, when they masturbated, their girlfriend walked in and got really upset. Now she's not talking to them except for yes/no answers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says they weren't in the mood, which is a common reason to decline sex. It's their right to set boundaries and say no. But then they masturbated while she was in the house. Maybe she felt hurt or rejected because he turned her down and then immediately used her presence or the situation to masturbate. That could feel disrespectful or dismissive, even if that's not the intention.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling him a \"dick\" and walking out. She might feel that he prioritized his needs without considering hers. Communication is key here. They've been together for two years, so maybe there's an unspoken expectation about intimacy. But the author didn't mention discussing boundaries about privacy or how they handle rejection. Maybe she felt invaded when she walked in, especially if she didn't expect him to masturbate in that situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have known she was nearby. If he used his laptop, maybe he thought he was in a private space. But if they live together and she walks in unannounced, there's a need for mutual respect regarding privacy. However, the main issue seems to be his reaction to her rejection and then his own actions. \n\nIs he wrong for masturbating after declining her? Not necessarily. People have different ways of handling their urges. But the context matters. If she felt hurt by the rejection and then he uses that moment to masturbate, it might come off as insensitive. The problem could be more about the lack of communication rather than the act itself. He didn't explain his actions, and she might need reassurance or an apology for feeling disregarded.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong not because of the masturbation itself, but because of the lack of consideration for her feelings in the situation. Not addressing her rejection properly and then acting on his own needs without considering hers could have caused her distress. Therefore, he should take responsibility for not being more communicative and empathetic.\n"
