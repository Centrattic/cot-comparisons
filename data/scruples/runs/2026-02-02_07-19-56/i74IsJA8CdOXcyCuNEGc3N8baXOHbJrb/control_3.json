When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend's attempt at sex, then later masturbated while she walked in and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for two years, both 21. He wasn't in the mood, so he said no. That seems reasonable. Then he masturbated later. The girlfriend reacted strongly, which the author is trying to understand.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. When he turned her down, he was honest, which is good. The masturbation part is where it might get tricky. If he was using her laptop or if there was an agreement about privacy, that could matter. But the story doesn't mention any prior issues. \n\nMaybe the girlfriend felt rejected when he said no, and then the masturbation made her feel even worse, like he wasn't respecting her. But is that his fault? He didn't do anything wrong by engaging in a personal activity unless there was a specific agreement against it. \n\nAlso, the way he used the laptop\u2014did he do anything she might find offensive? The story says he got his laptop, so maybe it's his own. The girlfriend might be upset because she walked in on him, but that's more about her reaction than his action. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe they need to talk about boundaries around privacy and how to handle low-mood moments. The author didn't violate any explicit boundaries, so he might not be in the wrong. However, if there was an unspoken understanding that he wouldn't masturbate when she was home, that could be a factor. But since there's no mention of that, it's probably not his fault. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is her issue, and he didn't do anything unethical.\n"
