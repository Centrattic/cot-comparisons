When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in and got upset. They've been together two years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy wasn't in the mood and said no, which is his right. Then he masturbated. The girlfriend walked in and was upset. The question is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nMasturbation is a personal choice, but in the context of a relationship, maybe there's an unspoken expectation. If they're in a committed relationship, could the act of masturbating while she's home be seen as insensitive, especially if she wanted intimacy? But she didn't know he was going to masturbate. He didn't have to do it in front of her. Also, he might have thought he was in privacy. However, if she walked in unexpectedly, maybe the issue is more about respect or communication.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling him a \"dick\" and not talking to him. That suggests she felt hurt or disrespected. The guy might not see a problem, but maybe she felt rejected or not considered. Did he consider her feelings when he chose to masturbate? Even if he was alone, using their laptop might have been a mistake, but he didn't know she'd walk in. Is it his fault? Maybe not entirely. But maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings, especially since she just turned him down. There's a possible lack of communication here. The guy wasn't wrong in turning down sex, but maybe the masturbation was done without considering her feelings, leading to her upset. So, is he in the wrong? Possibly, but maybe the answer is B (No) because he didn't intend to hurt her. Alternatively, A (Yes) if the action was disrespectful. Hmm.\n"
