When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a situation is in the wrong. The situation is about turning down a girlfriend for sex and then later masturbating while she walked in on him. The girlfriend is upset and hasn't been talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author said no to sex when his girlfriend wanted to have it, which is understandable because not being in the mood is normal. But then he masturbated while using his laptop, which his girlfriend walked in on. She was upset and called him a dick. \n\nNow, why would she be upset? Maybe she felt rejected when he said no, and then seeing him masturbate while she was around might have made her feel unappreciated or maybe even like he was being hypocritical. The key here is the context of their relationship and communication. If they had discussed sexual needs and boundaries, maybe the author's actions were okay. But if not, then the lack of communication could be an issue.\n\nThe author claims he didn't do anything wrong. The question is whether his actions were wrong. Masturbation is a personal choice, but the fact that he did it while she walked in on him could be a problem. Did he consider her feelings? If she was already upset about him turning her down, then engaging in a self-pleasuring act in her presence might be seen as insensitive. \n\nAlso, the location where he was masturbating matters. If he did it in a shared space or a room where she might walk in, maybe he didn't take privacy into account. That could be a mistake. But if it was in his own room and she walked in unexpectedly, that's different. The story doesn't specify, so I have to assume the context as given.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the author needs to consider her perspective. Saying no to sex is okay, but then engaging in a similar activity when she's nearby might be seen as dismissive. The author might be missing the emotional impact of his actions on her. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the act might have been hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, communication and sensitivity are key. The author didn't communicate his need to masturbate and might not have considered how his actions would affect his girlfriend after a rejection. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't take her feelings into account when making his choice to masturbate in her presence after turning her down.\n\nAlternatively, if masturbation is a normal activity and the girlfriend is overreacting, maybe not. But given the context of the rejection and her subsequent upset, it's more likely that the author's actions were inconsiderate. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
