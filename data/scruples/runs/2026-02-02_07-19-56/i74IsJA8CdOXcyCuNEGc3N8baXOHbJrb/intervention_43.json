When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on him. She's upset and not talking to him now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author said he wasn't in the mood and declined her. That's his right; everyone has the right to say no to sex. But then he masturbated, which his girlfriend found out. Why is she upset? Maybe she felt rejected or that he wasn't respecting her. But is there a rule against a partner masturbating? Not necessarily. However, maybe the fact that he used a laptop suggests he was using pornography, which some partners find uncomfortable. If that's the case, using porn without considering her feelings could be an issue. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling him a \"dick\" and walking out. She might feel that he prioritized his own needs over hers. But the author didn't do anything illegal or necessarily unethical. However, communication is key in relationships. Maybe the author should have discussed his feelings about not wanting sex and perhaps explained why he masturbated later. The key here is consent and mutual respect. The author isn't wrong for saying no to sex initially, but perhaps the follow-up action of masturbating while she was around could be seen as insensitive, especially if she felt rejected. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not considering her feelings after turning her down. But it's also possible that the girlfriend overreacted. \n\nAlternatively, the author isn't in the wrong because he's allowed to masturbate. But if the girlfriend has feelings about it, then it's a matter of communication. The answer might depend on the relationship's norms. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. The author might need to communicate better, but it's not necessarily his fault. The right answer here could be A (yes) because the act of masturbating after declining her might have hurt her feelings, and he should consider her perspective. But B (no) because it's his body and he's allowed to masturbate. Hmm, this is tricky. Maybe the main issue is the lack of communication. The author didn't explain his actions, leading to misunderstanding. So maybe he's partially at fault, but not entirely. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes; if B, no. Given that, I think the answer is A because the girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and the author should have considered that, but the scenario is a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, maybe it's not entirely his fault. I'm torn here. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But I need to decide based on the situation. The key is whether his actions were disrespectful. Using a laptop might imply using pornography, which could be a deal-breaker for some. If that's the case, then yes, he's in the wrong. But if he's just masturbating without porn, maybe not. Since the post doesn't specify, but mentions a laptop, maybe it's implied. So, the answer is A.\n"
