When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend for sex and then masturbating in front of her. They're confused because they don't think they did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, the author turned down sex because they weren't in the mood. That's a valid reason, and as long as they communicated it clearly, that's okay. The girlfriend might have felt rejected, but the author's response was honest.\n\nThen, the author masturbated in front of the girlfriend, which led to her being upset. The key point here is privacy. If the girlfriend walked in unexpectedly, the author might not have been aware she was coming. However, if they were in a shared space, maybe the author should have been more discreet. It's possible the girlfriend felt violated or embarrassed to see her partner doing that, which could explain her reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling the author a \"dick\" and cutting off communication. It's possible she's hurt or feels disrespected, maybe because she wasn't given a heads-up about the masturbation or because she's uncomfortable with the situation. The author might not see the issue, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid even if the author doesn't understand.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, turning down sex is fine, but the masturbation part might be the issue. If the author knew the girlfriend was nearby or if it's a private space, they should consider her feelings. Maybe the act itself isn't wrong, but the lack of consideration for her comfort could be. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the public masturbation and not respecting her privacy or feelings in that context.\n"
