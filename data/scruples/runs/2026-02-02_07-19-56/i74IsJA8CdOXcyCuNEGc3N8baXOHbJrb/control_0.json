When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy turned down his girlfriend for sex because he wasn't in the mood. Then later, when he was alone, he masturbated using his laptop, and his girlfriend walked in, got upset, and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, the guy wasn't in the mood for sex, so he said no. He thought that was okay because sometimes people aren't up for it. That part seems normal. But then later, he masturbated in front of her? Wait, no\u2014the story says he was using his laptop and she walked in during the session. So he was in the process of masturbating when she entered the room. Now, whether that's wrong depends on a few factors. \n\nIf they live together and share a home, privacy might be an issue. Maybe he didn't lock the door or take steps to ensure privacy, which could lead to someone walking in. On the flip side, if she walked into his room without knocking, that's also a privacy issue. But the key point here is that he was masturbating when she entered. \n\nIn some relationships, one partner might be uncomfortable with the other's private activities, especially if it's unexpected. Even if she didn't have an intention to walk in, the fact that he was doing it in a shared space might be a problem. However, if he was in his own room and she walked in without knocking, maybe the blame isn't entirely his. \n\nBut the bigger issue might be the context. The guy turned her down for sex earlier, and then later she saw him masturbating. She might feel that he's being inconsistent or not respecting her. Maybe she felt rejected and then saw him engaging in a sexual activity without her, which could feel hurtful or like a rejection by action. It's possible that she took it as a sign that he's not satisfied with their relationship or that he's being hypocritical. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy did nothing wrong in terms of consent. He turned down sex when he wasn't in the mood, which is his right. Later, he decided to masturbate, which is a personal choice. However, the problem might be the public nature of his masturbation. If they're in a shared living space, maybe he should have been more discreet to avoid her walking in. \n\nBut the main question is whether he's at fault. If the girlfriend suddenly walked in and saw him masturbating, maybe she was upset because she felt it was private and she saw it. Alternatively, she might be upset because she interpreted it as him being okay with sexual activity when it's not with her. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that their partner's masturbation in front of them is a sign of disrespect, especially if it's done without considering the other's feelings. However, the guy didn't do it on purpose; he was in the middle of it when she entered. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy might not be in the wrong for turning down sex and then choosing to masturbate. However, the way it happened might have caused a privacy issue. But since it was an accident (she walked in), maybe he's not at fault. But the girlfriend's perception is important here. If she felt hurt, maybe the guy could have been more considerate by ensuring privacy, but it's a bit of a grey area. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting because she's hurt from being rejected earlier, and this incident is the trigger. The guy might need to communicate with her to understand her feelings better. But in terms of right or wrong, it's hard to say. If there's no prior agreement about privacy or boundaries, then it's a misunderstanding rather than a clear fault. \n\nSo the answer would depend on whether the guy was in a private space and the circumstances of her entering. If he was in his room and she walked in without knocking, maybe she's partially at fault. But the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author didn't do it on purpose, maybe he's not wrong, but if there's a pattern of not respecting her privacy, maybe. But given the information, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A. But since the key is whether he did something wrong intentionally, and he didn't, then B.\n"
