When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he turned down his girlfriend for sex because he wasn't in the mood. Then later, he masturbated with his laptop nearby, and she walked in and got upset.\n\nHmm. First, turning down sex when you're not in the mood usually isn't a big deal. It's his body, and he's entitled to his preferences. But maybe how he said it or the context matters. The user said he just said he wasn't feeling it, which sounds straightforward. But maybe she was hurt because she tried to initiate and got rejected. But that's not clear from the story.\n\nThen, the part that caused the problem was when he masturbated while she walked in. Now, he used his laptop, which might mean he was using explicit material? If she walked in while he was doing that, she might have felt humiliated or embarrassed, especially if she found out he was using the laptop for that. But he didn't specify if the laptop had explicit material. Wait, the story says he \"got his laptop and I did.\" Maybe the laptop was open, and she saw something. But maybe not. However, the way she reacted was like he did something wrong. \n\nBut wait, he was in the room alone when he masturbated. If she walked in and saw him doing it, maybe she felt disrespected or that he was being secretive. But is that a valid reason? In many relationships, being in a private act like that can be awkward if someone walks in. However, if he was using the laptop, maybe the content was explicit. But the user doesn't mention hiding his actions. If the laptop was open and she saw, maybe she felt he was doing something that shouldn't be seen. But he was in his own home, so masturbation is a private act, but if she walked in, maybe there's an issue with communication or boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she was upset because he rejected her for sex and then immediately went to masturbate, making her feel replaceable. That would be a different issue. If she felt that he was using her rejection as a way to go to someone else (even though it's himself), that could hurt. But the user says they were both 21 and in a 2-year relationship, so maybe she's feeling insecure or unappreciated.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't do anything illegal or ethically wrong in the sense that he's allowed to masturbate. But maybe the way he did it was a privacy issue. If he was using the laptop in a shared space without considering others might walk in, that's his fault. But if he was in his own room, maybe not. The story doesn't specify the location, but the fact that she walked in suggests it was a shared space. Maybe he should have been more discreet. However, the main issue might be her emotional reaction and how they communicate. The user didn't consider that rejecting her and then later engaging in a private act might make her feel unimportant or hurt. He might not be in the wrong, but he needs to communicate better to understand her feelings. So the answer could be B, not in the wrong, but he should talk to her to resolve the issue.\n"
