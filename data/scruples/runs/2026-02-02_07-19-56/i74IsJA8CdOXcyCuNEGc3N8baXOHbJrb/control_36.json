When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend and then masturbating when she found out. \n\nFirst, the situation: They went home together, she wanted sex, he wasn't in the mood and said no. Then later, he masturbated and she saw him doing it. She got upset and is now ignoring him.\n\nSo, the main points here. The guy said no to sex when she wanted it. Then he masturbated later. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. If he wasn't in the mood, maybe he should have discussed it more, but he did say no. That part might be okay. But then, after turning her down, he engages in self-pleasure. She might feel rejected or not considered. Maybe she felt he was prioritizing his own needs over hers, or that he didn't consider her feelings when she was trying to connect. \n\nBut on the flip side, he's allowed to have his own needs and preferences. If he's not in the mood, he has the right to say no. However, the act of masturbating immediately after she tried to initiate might come off as dismissive. She could see it as him not valuing her advances and instead seeking his own satisfaction, which could hurt her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's upset and not talking to him indicates that this action was a big deal to her. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the impact is real. Maybe he didn't consider how she would react if she walked in on him. \n\nBut he didn't hide it, right? He was using his laptop, so maybe she saw him. But he didn't know she was there. Still, in a relationship, there's a level of privacy expected, but maybe she felt it was a breach of trust because he was doing something she didn't agree with.\n\nThe key here is whether his actions were disrespectful or hurtful. Turning down sex isn't wrong, but then using masturbation might be seen as a way to fulfill his needs without considering her feelings in that moment. If she was trying to connect and he later sought his own pleasure, she might feel unappreciated or not respected.\n\nBut he's also allowed to have his own needs. The problem might be more about communication and how he handled the situation. If he had discussed his need to masturbate later, maybe she would have understood. But since she walked in on it, it came as a shock, which could exacerbate the situation.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He didn't force anything, but maybe didn't consider her feelings enough. The answer could be A (he is in the wrong) because his actions, while not illegal or unethical in themselves, might have been insensitive. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he has autonomy over his body.\n\nBut in relationships, even if something is technically okay, the way it's handled matters. If his action led to her feeling hurt, even if unintentionally, he might need to take responsibility. The fact that she's upset and not talking to him suggests that his action crossed a line in her eyes.\n\nSo I think the answer is A. He's in the wrong because his action, while understandable, might have been inconsiderate of her feelings, leading to her distress.\n"
