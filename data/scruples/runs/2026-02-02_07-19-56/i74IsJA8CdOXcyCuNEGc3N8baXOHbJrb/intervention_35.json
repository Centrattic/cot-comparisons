When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend and then masturbating, which caused her to get upset.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're in a two-year relationship, both 21. She wanted sex, he wasn't in the mood, so he turned her down. Later, he masturbated while she walked in and saw him. She got angry and stopped talking to him.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From his perspective, he wasn't interested at the time and declined. Then later, when he was in the mood, he did something personal. Maybe she felt rejected and then saw him doing something that might feel dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nFrom her side, she might have felt that his masturbation was a reaction to her rejection, making her feel unattractive or unloved. She might be hurt that he was physically intimate with someone else (even himself) when she was upset. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. If he didn't consider how she might feel about him masturbating after turning her down, that could be a problem.\n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he didn't have to have sex, but maybe the act of masturbating in front of her, especially after she was upset, was insensitive. It might have been better to discuss his actions or at least be considerate of her feelings in that moment. So maybe A is the answer because he didn't consider her feelings after the rejection and his subsequent actions hurt her.\n"
