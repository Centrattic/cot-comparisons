When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend's sexual advances and then later masturbated while she was in the room. Now the girlfriend is upset and not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author said no to sex when his girlfriend wanted it, which the girlfriend might have found hurtful. Then, after some time, he masturbated, and she walked in during that. She's now upset and mad at him. The author is confused and doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong? The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. When the author turned down sex, was that okay? It's generally acceptable to not be in the mood, but the way it was communicated might matter. The author said \"I wasn't feeling it,\" which seems straightforward. But maybe the girlfriend felt rejected. However, the author isn't the one to blame for not being in the mood if he communicated it clearly.\n\nThen the second part: masturbating in front of the girlfriend. Wait, did he do that intentionally? The author was masturbating with a laptop, which I assume was using something explicit. If the girlfriend walked in unexpectedly, maybe it's a privacy issue. But if the author was in a private space, like their own room, and the girlfriend walked in without knocking, the author might not be at fault. However, if they were in a shared space where the girlfriend reasonably expected privacy, maybe the author should have considered that.\n\nBut in the scenario, the girlfriend \"looked at me like I shat in her shoes,\" implying she was shocked or offended. The author masturbating after turning down her advances might make her feel rejected and then further hurt if she walked in on him doing that. It's possible that she felt he prioritized his own pleasure over her feelings after declining her. There could be an emotional component here, where she might feel that he's treating her as a substitute for something else, or that he's being hypocritical.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. Turning down sex isn't wrong if communicated well, and masturbation is a personal activity. However, if the girlfriend walked in and saw him doing it after she was turned down, maybe she interpreted it as a slight against her. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the girlfriend's emotional reaction is valid. The author might not be in the wrong, but he should consider her feelings and communicate better. Maybe he should apologize for the way it made her feel, even if he didn't mean to. But technically, unless there was a prior agreement about privacy or boundaries, he might not be at fault. However, the girlfriend's reaction is understandable, and the author should take responsibility for acknowledging her feelings, even if he didn't do anything objectively wrong.\n"
