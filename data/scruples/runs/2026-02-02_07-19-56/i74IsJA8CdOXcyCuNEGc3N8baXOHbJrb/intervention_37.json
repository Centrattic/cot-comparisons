When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy turned down his girlfriend for sex and then later masturbated while she walked in on him. She got upset and is now acting distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy explained he wasn't in the mood and turned her down, which is his right. Then later, he masturbated, which isn't inherently wrong. But when she walked in, maybe she felt hurt or betrayed. But why?\n\nMaybe she felt rejected when he turned her down and then saw him getting pleasure from another source. It could be seen as insensitive. Even though he wasn't at fault for not being in the mood, the timing and the fact that she walked in might have made her feel disrespected. Did he consider her feelings when he chose to masturbate right after turning her down? Maybe she wanted some time to process or needed emotional connection instead. \n\nBut the guy doesn't see himself as wrong. He didn't force her to do anything, and he was honest about not being in the mood. Masturbating is a personal choice. However, maybe the act of doing it while she was around, even if she didn't know, could have been avoided. If she walked in and saw him doing it, it might have been a trigger for her, making her feel replaced or unappreciated. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction seems extreme. She called him a name and left. Maybe she's dealing with her own insecurities or unmet emotional needs. The guy might not be in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. Maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings by not masturbating immediately after rejecting her, or at least not using the laptop (maybe she saw it as a provocation). \n\nBut is he actually in the wrong? If he was honest about not being in the mood, and then later chose to masturbate, which is a personal activity, then technically he's not doing anything wrong. The problem might be more about communication and her emotional response. So in that case, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. However, if his actions were insensitive, maybe A. \n\nI think the key here is whether his actions were disrespectful. Since he was honest about his lack of desire and then later did something he wanted to do, it's his right. The girlfriend's reaction is her own issue, but maybe he could have been more empathetic. But the question is about being in the wrong. Unless there's a betrayal or deceit, he isn't necessarily wrong. So I lean towards B. But some might argue A because he didn't consider her feelings. Hmm. The user's initial thought is A, but I think B is possible.\n"
