When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and then masturbating when she walked in. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author said no to sex when his girlfriend wanted it. He wasn't in the mood, which is understandable. But then, two hours later, he decided to masturbate. The key point here is that he used his laptop to do so, and his girlfriend walked in during the act. She was clearly upset, called him a name, and now they're not talking much.\n\nNow, considering the context: they've been together for two years. Communication is crucial in any relationship. The author didn't feel like having sex, which is fine, but maybe the way he handled it after could be an issue. When he masturbated, especially if he was in the same house, maybe he should have considered her feelings. The girlfriend might feel hurt or rejected because he turned her down and then immediately sought self-gratification without considering her emotions. That could be seen as insensitive.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't know she'd walk in. He was using his laptop, which isn't inherently private? Maybe not. The problem is the girlfriend's reaction. She felt embarrassed or hurt when she saw him. The real question is about the right to privacy. If he was in his own home and using a laptop, maybe the door wasn't closed, but if she walked in unexpectedly, is that his fault? Or is the issue that he masturbated right after rejecting her, which might have added insult to injury?\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the initial refusal isn't necessarily wrong if it's a genuine lack of interest. But the act of masturbating when she walks in could be a privacy issue. However, the bigger issue might be the girlfriend's emotional response. If he had a right to privacy, then maybe he's not at fault. But relationships often require considering each other's feelings. If he was in a place where she could enter without warning, maybe he should have been more discreet. But the problem is more about her reaction than his actions per se. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's upset because he rejected her for sex and then immediately went to masturbate, which she might perceive as prioritizing his own needs over hers. That could be a communication issue. However, the act of masturbating itself isn't necessarily wrong unless it was in a public space or without privacy. Since he was using a laptop, maybe it's a private space, but if she walked in, perhaps he should have been more cautious. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the main points are: he turned her down for a legitimate reason, then later masturbated, and she saw him. If he was in his own room, it's a privacy issue. But if they're in a shared space, maybe he should have been more considerate. But the author's actions might not be wrong. However, the girlfriend's reaction could be due to feeling rejected and then seeing him have a sexual release, which could feel hurtful. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people might judge him for the timing, but legally, there's no wrong. Emotionally, maybe he's not at fault, but relationships require mutual understanding. The answer could hinge on communication. If he had discussed his feelings instead of acting alone, maybe it would have helped. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about improving communication. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the girlfriend's feelings are important. However, the act itself isn't necessarily wrong unless there was intent to hurt her.\n"
