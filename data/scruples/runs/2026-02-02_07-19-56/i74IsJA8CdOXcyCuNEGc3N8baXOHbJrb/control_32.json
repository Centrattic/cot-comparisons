When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend's attempt to have sex and later masturbated while she walked in on him, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He said he wasn't in the mood when she initiated, which is a common and valid reason to decline sex. There's no indication of abuse or harm there. Then, after two hours, he decides to masturbate. The key point here is whether his actions were wrong. \n\nMasturbation is a personal choice and a normal activity. The fact that he used his laptop might imply he was watching something, but the question is about the act itself. However, the girlfriend walked in and was upset. The issue here could be about privacy and mutual respect. If he was in a shared space where she could walk in, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings, especially after turning her down. \n\nBut is that his fault? If he was in a room where it's reasonable to expect privacy, maybe not. The problem might be that she felt hurt because he turned her down and then went to masturbate, which she might perceive as dismissive. However, the author's actions don't seem malicious. He didn't do anything wrong by his own account; he just wasn't in the mood and later satisfied himself. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction could be due to feeling rejected and then seeing him engage in an activity that might remind her of the rejection. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong unless there were specific agreements about such behavior. Without more context, like if they had discussed boundaries beforehand, it's hard to say he's at fault. \n\nI think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe the fact that she walked in is a privacy issue, but that's more about her entering the room. The author's decision to masturbate is his own, and it's not inherently wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
