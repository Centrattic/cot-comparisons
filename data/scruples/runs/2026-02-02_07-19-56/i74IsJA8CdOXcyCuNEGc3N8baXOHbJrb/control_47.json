When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on them, leading to her being upset.\n\nFirst, the man said no to sex when she wanted it. That's a valid choice, but maybe she felt rejected. Then, he masturbated alone, which she saw. She reacted strongly, calling him a \"dick\" and not talking to him. The key points here are communication and respect for each other's feelings.\n\nTurning down sex isn't wrong, but doing it without explaining could be an issue. Maybe she was hurt that he declined and then felt even more upset when she found out he was masturbating. The problem might be that he didn't consider her feelings after rejecting her. Even though he's not obligated to have sex, the way he handled it could be seen as dismissive or hurtful. Also, masturbating in her presence might make her feel like he's prioritizing his needs without her, which could cause her distress. The author might be in the wrong for not being considerate of her emotions after the rejection. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
