When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about turning down his girlfriend for sex and then masturbating, which led to her getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy said no to sex because he wasn't in the mood. That's his right, right? People have different moods and times when they don't want to engage. But then he masturbated while she was around. Maybe she felt rejected when he turned her down, and then seeing him masturbate might make her feel even worse. It could be perceived as insensitive or dismissive.\n\nBut wait, the guy might not think it's a big deal. He wasn't in the mood, and then he took care of his own needs. However, the girlfriend's reaction is important here. If she walked in during his masturbation, maybe she felt embarrassed or violated. Even if he didn't mean to, the act of masturbating in her presence might be crossing a boundary. \n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. Maybe they didn't discuss boundaries about privacy or how to handle situations when one person is not interested. The guy didn't consider her feelings when he turned her down and then proceeded to masturbate, which could be seen as not respecting her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy might not have known that she would react that way. He might not have intended to hurt her. But the fact that she's upset and not talking to him now suggests that his actions did upset her. So, maybe he is at least partially responsible for not considering her feelings in the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. He did nothing illegal, but in terms of being considerate, he might have missed a chance to support his partner's feelings. So, maybe the answer is that he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her emotional state after rejecting her and then engaging in an act that might have made her feel worse.\n"
