When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author turned down their girlfriend for sex because they weren't in the mood. That's understandable, right? People have different moods and it's normal to not feel like having sex sometimes. The girlfriend tried to initiate, he said no, which is his right. So far, no issue there.\n\nThen, two hours later, he gets horny and decides to masturbate. He uses his laptop, which probably means he's watching something. While he's in the middle of this, the girlfriend walks in and gets upset. She calls him a dick and walks out. Now, he's confused because he doesn't see why she's upset.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. He was in the act of masturbating, which is a private activity. The girlfriend walked in on him, which might be embarrassing for both parties. But why is she so upset? Maybe she felt hurt or betrayed because he was masturbating while she was in the house. But is that his fault?\n\nHe didn't do anything wrong by being in the mood later. He might have been in a private space, but if she walked in, maybe the door wasn't closed or he should have used a different location. However, the initial refusal to have sex wasn't his fault. The masturbation is a personal choice. Unless there was an agreement about not doing that in front of her or in the house, he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend felt disrespected or thinks that he's not being considerate. Maybe she was still upset from being turned down earlier and found his masturbation offensive. The author might need to communicate and explain that he wasn't avoiding her or being unfaithful, but just not in the mood. The act of masturbation isn't wrong per se, but the situation might have been mishandled. However, the initial action of turning down sex was appropriate. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had the right to refuse sex and to take care of his needs later. The girlfriend's reaction is more about her feelings and possibly miscommunication rather than him doing something wrong.\n"
