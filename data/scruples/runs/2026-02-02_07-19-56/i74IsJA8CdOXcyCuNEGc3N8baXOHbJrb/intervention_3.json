When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex and then masturbated. She walked in on him doing it and got upset. The author is confused because he didn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for two years, both 21. The author said no to sex because he wasn't in the mood, which is his right. But then he masturbated. Maybe she felt rejected or thought that the refusal meant he wanted to have sex alone, which could be hurtful. The key point is that she's upset, maybe feeling unappreciated or that he's using her for his own needs.\n\nIs there a breach of trust here? If they have an agreement about privacy, maybe he didn't do anything wrong. But if she felt that his refusal and subsequent masturbation were disrespectful, then the author might be in the wrong. Communication is crucial here. The author didn't mention discussing boundaries about privacy or intimacy. Maybe the girlfriend felt that he was prioritizing his own needs over hers after turning her down. \n\nAnother angle: when she initiated sex and he said no, it's possible she was seeking emotional or physical connection. Then, him masturbating might have felt like a rejection or a sign that he's using her as a substitute. Even if he didn't mean it that way, it could come across as insensitive. \n\nThe author's actions might have been a mistake in not considering her feelings. Even if he's entitled to his own needs, the timing and her reaction suggest that his actions hurt her. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her perspective and potentially made her feel unvalued. Answer A.\n"
