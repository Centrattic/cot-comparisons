When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend's attempt at sex because he wasn't in the mood, then later masturbated in front of her when she walked in on him. Now she's upset and not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel he was honest about not being in the mood and that he had the right to masturbate. But from the girlfriend's side, she might see it as a betrayal or a lack of consideration. She initiated sex, he declined, then she saw him masturbating later, which could feel like he's choosing to get his needs met without her, which might hurt her feelings or make her feel rejected.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The author didn't do anything illegal or unethical, but relationships require mutual respect. If he was honest about not being in the mood, that's good. But then, when his girlfriend walked in on him masturbating, she likely felt that he was prioritizing his own needs over hers, especially after declining her. It might come across as insensitive, even if that wasn't the intention.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She's visibly upset and not talking to him. She might be feeling disrespected or that her feelings were disregarded. The act of masturbating after declining her might be seen as a way to ignore her rejection and proceed with his own needs, which can be hurtful in a close relationship.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he didn't do anything wrong because he was honest and that he has the right to manage his own sexual needs. But in the context of a relationship, actions can have emotional impacts. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the effect was there. It's about how his actions made her feel, not just his intentions.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because his actions, while not malicious, were likely hurtful and could be perceived as disrespectful to his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
