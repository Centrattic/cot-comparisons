In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy turned down his girlfriend for sex because he wasn't in the mood, and later he masturbated while she saw him doing it. She got upset and hasn't been talking to him. He's confused and doesn't feel he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both are young, 21, in a 2-year relationship. He turned down her attempt at sex, which is his right. People can be not in the mood sometimes. Then later, he masturbated. The issue is that she walked in on him. But why is she upset?\n\nPossible angles: Maybe she felt rejected again when he masturbated while she was around? Or maybe she took it as a sign that he wasn't interested in her, or that he was prioritizing his own needs over hers. But the act of masturbating in front of her might be the issue. Even if he wasn't in the mood earlier, doing it right after she was turned down could be seen as dismissive or hurtful. Also, the fact that she walked in and he was using his laptop might imply he was watching something, which could be a privacy issue. But maybe she's just reacting to the fact that he turned her down and then satisfied his needs without her. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, he didn't force her to do anything. He respected her when she initiated, and later acted on his own needs. But maybe there's a communication issue. He could have told her he wasn't in the mood earlier, then later, instead of just doing it, maybe he should have checked in with her again or made sure she was okay. But he didn't do that. Also, if she walked in on him, maybe he didn't consider her feelings in the moment. \n\nAlternately, maybe she's overreacting. He didn't do anything illegal or harmful; he's entitled to his own needs. However, in relationships, actions can affect each other's feelings. If she was upset about being rejected earlier, seeing him masturbate might feel like a reminder of her rejection. \n\nIt's possible that he's not in the wrong, but there's a lack of communication. Maybe he should have explained his actions, or considered her feelings. But he didn't have to apologize for his own behavior. The key is whether his actions were hurtful. If she's upset because he's not reciprocating, maybe there's an imbalance. But he didn't do anything wrong per se. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
