When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the A-hole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend's sexual advances and later masturbated while she was present, which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author said no to sex, which is his right. People have the right to refuse intimacy, even in a relationship. Then, later, he masturbated. The girlfriend walked in on him and was upset. The author is confused because he doesn't see why she's angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a general perspective, refusing sex isn't wrong. But the act of masturbating after saying no might be where the issue lies. If the girlfriend was upset because he was using her or being disrespectful, maybe there's an underlying issue. But without more context, like if she was trying to be affectionate and he was rejecting her physically and then engaging in solo activity, it could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Also, maybe there's an unspoken boundary or expectation in their relationship that he violated by masturbating after declining her. \n\nBut some might argue that he's not obligated to be intimate and his subsequent actions are his own. However, if she walked in on him and felt hurt, maybe the timing or the fact that he was in the same space could be an issue. It depends on their communication and mutual understanding. \n\nThe author didn't communicate his reasons for not being in the mood, but that's a different matter. The main issue is the masturbation part. If the girlfriend felt that he was prioritizing his own needs over hers, even after saying no, that could cause hurt feelings. But if they have open communication about such things, maybe it's okay. \n\nIn many relationships, it's about mutual respect and understanding. If the author's actions made her feel unappreciated or not considered, then maybe he is in the wrong. But if he's honest and they can talk about it, perhaps it's a misunderstanding. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author might be in the wrong because the act of masturbating after declining could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful, especially if it's done in her presence or if there's an expectation of mutual consideration. So the answer would be A.\n"
