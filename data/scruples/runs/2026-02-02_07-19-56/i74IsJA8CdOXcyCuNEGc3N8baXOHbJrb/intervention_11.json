When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in and got upset.\n\nFirst, the author said he wasn't in the mood and turned down his girlfriend. That's understandable. People have different moods, and it's normal to not be interested sometimes. So maybe that part isn't wrong.\n\nThen, later he masturbated. The girlfriend walked in and got angry. The author might feel it's their own business, but maybe the girlfriend felt embarrassed or hurt. Maybe she saw it as disrespectful or a violation of trust. Even if he was alone, she might have felt uncomfortable. \n\nThe key is communication. The author didn't consider her feelings when he turned her down and then later, when he masturbated, she felt hurt. Maybe he should have been more considerate of her presence or discussed their needs. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's upset. \n\nThe author might not realize that even though he's allowed to have his own needs, how he handles them in a relationship matters. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the situation properly.\n"
