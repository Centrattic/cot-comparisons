When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that they turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on them. The girlfriend is now upset and not talking to them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author said they weren't in the mood when their girlfriend wanted to have sex. That's normal, right? People have different moods, and it's okay to say no. But then later, when the author was alone, they masturbated. The girlfriend walked in, got upset, called them a dick, and hasn't been talking since.\n\nThe main question is if the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. Turning down sex is not wrong. The problem might be the masturbation part. If the girlfriend walked in while he was masturbating, maybe she felt hurt or embarrassed. But why would she be so upset? Maybe she felt rejected when he said no, and then her walking in on him masturbating makes her feel like he's not interested in her or is using her for sex. But he did say no earlier, so maybe she's mad because he's getting his needs met outside the relationship? Although the author mentions he was alone when he masturbated, so perhaps he didn't do anything wrong there.\n\nBut maybe the issue is about consent and privacy. If he was masturbating in a private area, it's his right. However, if she walked in, maybe the issue is that he didn't close the door or something. But the post says he was using his laptop, which might mean he was in a room where she could enter. So maybe the problem is that she felt intruded upon when she saw him doing that. But she walked in on him, not the other way around. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might be upset because after he rejected her, she felt he was being rude or dismissive, and now seeing him masturbate makes her feel like he's not interested in her. But the author didn't do anything wrong by masturbating, especially since they're in a relationship. Unless there's an unspoken rule against it. But in most relationships, unless specified, people can masturbate. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong. However, maybe the way he handled the rejection could be improved. If he could have explained his feelings better or showed empathy, maybe the situation would have been different. But the act of turning down sex and then later masturbating in private isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own feelings of rejection and possibly insecurity, not the author's actions directly. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He didn't do anything that's a dealbreaker. The issue might be more about communication and her emotional response rather than his actions being objectively wrong.\n"
