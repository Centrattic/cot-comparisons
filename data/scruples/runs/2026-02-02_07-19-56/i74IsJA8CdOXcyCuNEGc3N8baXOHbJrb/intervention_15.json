When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend's attempt at having sex and then later masturbated while she walked in on him. She got upset and is now distant.\n\nFirst, the author says he wasn't in the mood, and that's fine. It's normal to not feel like having sex sometimes. But then he masturbated later while she was nearby. The girlfriend walked in and was upset. Why would she be upset? Maybe she felt rejected when he turned her down, and then finding him masturbating might have made her feel even worse. It could be perceived as him using her rejection to then take care of his own needs without considering her feelings. Even if he didn't do anything wrong, maybe he should have been more considerate of her emotions. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he didn't force her, he just said no. But maybe he didn't consider how his actions after her rejection might affect her. If he was in the mood to masturbate after saying no to her, maybe she felt he was prioritizing his own needs over hers. There's a lack of communication here. The author could have talked to her about why he wasn't in the mood and maybe checked in on her feelings after. Instead, he went off on his own, which might have been hurtful. \n\nSo, on one hand, it's okay to not be in the mood. On the other hand, his masturbation might have been insensitive, especially if she was still trying to connect emotionally. The key is that he didn't consider her feelings after turning her down. Maybe he should have discussed it more or waited until she wasn't around. So, I think the answer is that he's partially at fault. He's not entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it better. However, the question is a binary choice between A and B. Given that, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't consider her feelings, leading to her upset. Alternatively, if you think he's not in the wrong because he didn't do anything illegal or abusive, then B. But given the emotional context, A makes sense. So I'll go with A.\n"
