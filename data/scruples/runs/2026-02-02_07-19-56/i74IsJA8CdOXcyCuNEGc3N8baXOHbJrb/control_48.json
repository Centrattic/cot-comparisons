When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend and then masturbating after she walked in on him. \n\nFirst, turning down a partner when they're trying to initiate sex. The author said he wasn't in the mood, which is a valid reason. People have different moods and energy levels, so refusing isn't inherently wrong. But maybe the way he communicated it could be an issue? The story doesn't mention any harsh words, just that he said he wasn't feeling it. So maybe not.\n\nThen, he masturbated later. The key point here is that his girlfriend walked in on him. The problem might be that he used her laptop, which could imply he wasn't respecting their shared space or privacy. If she's uncomfortable with him masturbating, even if it's in their home, using her laptop might cross a line. Also, the fact that she got upset when she found him doing this suggests that there's an unspoken boundary he crossed. \n\nBut wait, is it wrong to masturbate? Not necessarily. However, if the partner is uncomfortable with it, especially being in the same room, that could be an issue. The author didn't consider her feelings here. Maybe he should have gone to a different room or used a different device. The use of the laptop might be a trigger for her if she feels it's too public or if there's a history of issues around privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling him a dick and being visibly upset. It's possible she felt embarrassed or hurt that he was doing that while they were home together. The author might not see it as a big deal, but in relationships, respect for each other's comfort zones is important. So, even if the act itself isn't wrong, the context and how it was handled might be.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings about the situation. Using her laptop could have been a privacy issue, and not anticipating her discomfort when she walked in. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
