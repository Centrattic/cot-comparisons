When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex because they weren't in the mood, and later masturbated with their laptop, which the girlfriend saw and got upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was honest about not being in the mood, which is generally a good practice in relationships. But then they masturbated while using the laptop, and the girlfriend walked in on it. The girlfriend's reaction is anger and not talking anymore.\n\nSo, maybe the issue is about privacy. If the author was in their own home and the girlfriend walked in, that's one thing, but if they were in a room where the girlfriend had a reasonable expectation of privacy, maybe not. Wait, no, it's their home. The problem might be that the author was using the laptop in a space where they knew the girlfriend could enter, so maybe they should have been more considerate about their privacy. \n\nAlso, maybe the girlfriend felt betrayed or disrespected because he turned her down and then immediately engaged in self-pleasure, which could be seen as prioritizing his own needs over her feelings. But is that a valid perspective? Communication is key here. The author didn't do anything illegal or necessarily cruel, but emotions can be hurt when someone feels neglected or not considered.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might be feeling rejected when she was turned down, and then seeing him masturbate later could make her feel like he's not respecting their relationship boundaries. Maybe the author didn't consider how his actions might affect her emotionally. Even though he didn't do anything wrong in a strict sense, the way it came across might be the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't hide it; he was in his own home and using his laptop. If the girlfriend walked in unannounced, maybe she's overreacting. But the key point is that the girlfriend is upset, and the author needs to understand why. The problem might be the lack of communication about boundaries around privacy and intimacy.\n\nIn many relationships, there's an unspoken understanding about privacy. If the author was in a room where the girlfriend could enter, he might have assumed it was okay, but if they had separate spaces, maybe he should have been in a different area. Also, the act of turning her down and then masturbating could be perceived as dismissive, even if that's not the intention.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the relationship's norms. If they had discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe not. But if this is the first time this happened and the girlfriend felt hurt, the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings and possibly not respecting privacy. The answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions, while not illegal, might have disregarded the girlfriend's emotional needs and privacy expectations.\n"
