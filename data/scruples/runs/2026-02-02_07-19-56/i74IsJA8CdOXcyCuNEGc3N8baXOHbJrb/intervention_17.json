When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he turned down his girlfriend for sex when she initiated, then later masturbated while she walked in on him. She's upset and not talking to him.\n\nFirst, when someone turns down their partner's attempt to have sex, especially if they're in a committed relationship, it's important to consider their feelings. The author said he wasn't in the mood, which is understandable, but maybe he should have communicated better. Just saying \"no\" without any explanation might make her feel rejected or unappreciated. But he did mention she's beautiful and he's not uninterested, so maybe he was just not in the mood that day.\n\nThen, when he masturbated later, she walked in on him. That's where it might get tricky. If she's upset because he was masturbating instead of her, she might feel that he's being selfish or not respecting her. But is there an expectation that when one partner isn't in the mood, the other should wait or not masturbate? That could be a cultural or personal boundary issue. The author didn't do anything wrong in terms of cheating, but maybe the act of masturbating in her presence without considering her feelings is the problem here.\n\nShe reacted strongly, calling him a \"dick\" and not talking to him. Her reaction seems a bit harsh if the issue was just him masturbating. But maybe she was hurt from the rejection earlier and this was a trigger. The author might not realize how his actions affected her emotionally. He might need to apologize and talk about it, but does that mean he's in the wrong?\n\nThe key points are: rejecting her initiative might have made her feel unloved, and then masturbating when she found out could have made her feel replaced or not desired. The author might not have considered her feelings in both instances. So, he might be in the wrong for not being sensitive to her emotions. But if there were no prior discussions about this, maybe it's not entirely his fault. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) because of the emotional impact on her even if he didn't mean to hurt her.\n"
