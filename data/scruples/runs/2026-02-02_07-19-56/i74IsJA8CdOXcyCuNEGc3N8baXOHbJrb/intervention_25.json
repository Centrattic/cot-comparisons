When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend's attempt at sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on him and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The man said he wasn't in the mood and turned her down, which is understandable. People have off days, and not being in the mood is normal. But then he later masturbated. His girlfriend's reaction is key here. She felt hurt because he turned her down but then satisfied his needs alone, which might make her feel rejected or unimportant.\n\nIn relationships, communication and consideration are important. Even if he wasn't in the mood, the fact that he later masturbated might make her feel like her rejection was taken out on her. It's possible she was trying to connect and felt ignored. The fact that she walked in on him and got upset suggests she felt disrespected or unvalued.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he had no intention to hurt her and just acted on his own needs, maybe not. However, the key point is how his actions made her feel. Even if he didn't mean to, his actions could have been insensitive. The responsibility here might lie in not considering her feelings after rejecting her advances. So, even if he's not intentionally malicious, he might be in the wrong for not being empathetic enough.\n\nLooking at the dynamics, the girlfriend's hurt reaction is valid. The man might need to apologize and talk about her feelings. The answer could lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because his actions, while not malicious, were inconsiderate and hurt her. But some might argue B, saying he had the right to his own needs. However, in a relationship, partners should consider each other's feelings, so A makes sense.\n"
