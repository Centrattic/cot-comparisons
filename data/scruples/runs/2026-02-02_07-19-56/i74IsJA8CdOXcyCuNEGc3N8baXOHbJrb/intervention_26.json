When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and then masturbating while she was around. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're a couple of two years, both 21. He turns her down for sex because he wasn't in the mood. That seems okay, right? People have different moods. But then later, he masturbates using his laptop, and she walks in. She's upset, calls him a name, and now they're not talking.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. When he turned her down, maybe he didn't explain his feelings properly. She might have felt rejected or not considered. Then, when he masturbates, maybe she felt disrespected or that he was prioritizing his own needs without considering hers. Even if he wasn't in the mood earlier, the act of masturbating when she's nearby could be seen as insensitive. \n\nBut wait, he didn't know she was going to walk in. Maybe he didn't realize she'd be there. But the fact that she was upset suggests that her presence during his masturbation was an issue. Maybe they need to talk about boundaries\u2014like when and where certain activities are appropriate. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, turning down sex isn't wrong if he's honest. But the masturbation part could be a misstep. If he knew she was around, maybe he should have waited. But he didn't know. Still, maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings. She might feel like he's not respecting her if he's doing that when she's nearby. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she overreacted. But given that they're a couple, communication is key. He should probably talk to her to understand why she's upset and express his side. But the initial act of turning her down and then masturbating might have crossed a line in her eyes, especially without prior discussion about boundaries. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because he might not have considered her feelings in the masturbation part, even if unintentionally. The rejection could have been handled better, and the masturbation incident might have lacked consideration for her presence.\n"
