When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guy turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in and got upset. He's confused why she's angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He said he wasn't in the mood, which is a common reason to decline intimacy. That part seems okay. But then he masturbated while she was in the house. The girlfriend walked in and was upset. The question is whether his actions were wrong.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If the girlfriend felt uncomfortable or hurt because he was masturbating when she walked in, maybe there's an issue with communication or expectations. But is he at fault for masturbating? Masturbation is a normal activity, but the context matters. If he was in a private space and she walked in by accident, maybe not. However, if there's an unspoken agreement or if he knew she might come in, maybe he should have been more discreet.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She called him a name and is now distant. It's possible she felt rejected or humiliated when she walked in. But does his action of masturbating after declining her make him wrong? Or is her reaction based on her own feelings rather than his wrongdoing?\n\nIt could be a miscommunication. He might not have considered how she would feel if she walked in, even if he wasn't intentionally trying to hurt her. Alternatively, she might have overreacted. Without more context, it's hard to say definitively. But in general, turning down a partner for sex isn't wrong, and masturbating is normal. The issue might be about how she perceived the situation, maybe feeling rejected in a different way. But unless there's an agreement against masturbation, he's probably not in the wrong. So answer B, No.\n"
