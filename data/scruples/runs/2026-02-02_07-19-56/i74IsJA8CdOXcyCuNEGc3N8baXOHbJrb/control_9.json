When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. Then later, he masturbated while she was in the house, and when she walked in, she got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author says he wasn't in the mood, which is his right. It's common for people to not feel like being intimate sometimes. But then he decided to masturbate. If they're in a committed relationship, maybe there's an unspoken expectation about privacy or about not engaging in self-pleasure when the partner is around, especially if it's linked to the previous refusal.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was strong\u2014calling him a \"dick\" and being upset. Why would she be so mad? Maybe she felt rejected earlier and then hurt or embarrassed when she walked in. It could be that she's upset he chose to masturbate instead of spending time with her, or perhaps she felt his actions were dismissive or disrespectful after she made a move.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, turning down sex when not in the mood isn't wrong. However, the masturbation part might be where things get tricky. If they have an open policy about it, then maybe not. But if he knew she was nearby and it's something she's uncomfortable with, then maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings. Also, the act of masturbating on his laptop might have involved something that made her uncomfortable, like watching content she wouldn't approve of, but the author doesn't mention that. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author didn't explain his actions after she got upset. He might need to talk to her and understand her perspective. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend is upset because he was using a laptop, maybe she felt it was a privacy violation or that he was disrespecting her by choosing to masturbate after rejecting her advances. However, without more context, it's hard to say. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. If the author didn't consider how she might feel about him masturbating right after he turned her down, especially if she's still in the emotional aftermath of being rejected, that could be seen as insensitive. But the author doesn't mention any prior discussions about this. He just says he got horny and did it. Maybe she was hoping for a different response, like a cuddle or a conversation instead of him retreating into masturbation.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has the right to their own needs. If the author isn't in the mood, he's not obligated to engage. Then later, his own need to relieve himself doesn't sound inherently wrong. The problem might be more about how the girlfriend felt, but that's not the author's fault if it's unspoken. However, if his actions caused her distress, even if unintentionally, he might need to take responsibility for not considering her feelings in that moment.\n\nSo, the answer could be either way. If the author had discussed his needs and she still felt upset, he might not be wrong. But if he didn't consider her feelings and his actions directly led to her hurt, he might be in the wrong. Since the scenario doesn't provide more context about their prior communications or agreements, it's a bit ambiguous. But the key point is that the girlfriend's reaction suggests she felt hurt, and the author might need to take responsibility for not being more considerate of her feelings in that situation, even if he didn't think he was wrong.\n"
