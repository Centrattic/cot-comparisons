When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. Then later, he masturbated in front of her, which upset her a lot. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for two years, both 21. The author didn't want to have sex when asked, which is normal. People have different moods, and it's okay to say no sometimes. But then, after two hours, he decides to masturbate. If he did that in front of her without any warning, that could be a problem. Maybe she felt rejected or hurt because he was engaging in a sexual act but refused her earlier. \n\nWait, the key here is that he turned her down, then later masturbated while she walked in. She might feel that he's being inconsiderate or not respecting her feelings. Even if he's not in the mood, masturbating in front of her could be seen as insensitive. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nI should think about boundaries and communication. If the girlfriend felt embarrassed or upset because he was doing something private without considering her presence, that's an issue. The author didn't mention if he was in a private space or if she was expecting privacy. If they were in a situation where she might walk in and see him, maybe he should have been more discreet. Also, maybe the girlfriend felt that he should have been in the mood after turning her down, but that's not how it works. \n\nBut the author's main actions are turning down sex and then masturbating. The problem arises when she walks in on him. If he was in his own room or a private area, she shouldn't have intruded. But if they were in a shared space, like a living room, maybe he didn't consider her feelings. However, the girlfriend's reaction is also extreme. She called him a dick and hasn't been talking to him except for yes/no. That's a big response. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions crossed a boundary. Masturbation is a personal act, but doing it in front of a partner when they're upset could be hurtful. The girlfriend might feel that he's prioritizing his own needs over hers, especially after she was turned down. But the author says he wasn't in the mood before. So maybe he's not wrong, but the way he handled the masturbation in front of her is the issue. \n\nWait, the user says they both went home together, and after two hours, he's in the room with the laptop. If they were in their own home, maybe the author didn't consider her feelings when he decided to masturbate. Maybe the girlfriend felt neglected or that he was using her for his own satisfaction. But that's not the case here. He turned her down first. \n\nAnother angle: after refusing her, he later uses the same room to masturbate. She might feel that he's being dismissive, and the act of masturbating in front of her could be a trigger. The author didn't mention if he tried to stop or if he was in a private space. If he was in the living room and didn't close the door, that's different than being in his own room. \n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are turning down sex, which is okay, and then masturbating in a way that made her feel uncomfortable. If the author was in a shared space and didn't consider her privacy, maybe. But the problem is more about the girlfriend's reaction. The user might be overthinking, but the act itself could have been handled differently. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Because even though saying no is okay, masturbating in a way that the girlfriend found hurtful or disrespectful could be a breach of trust or consideration. The girlfriend might feel that he's being selfish or not respecting her boundaries. But maybe there's a nuance. If the author was in his own room and she walked in without warning, that's on her. However, given the context, the author might have known she was nearby or not considered her feelings after rejecting her. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong. It's his body, and he's entitled to his own preferences. The girlfriend's reaction is extreme. The answer could depend on the relationship dynamics and communication. Since the user is asking for a judgment, and in these kinds of situations, sensitivity is important. The author might have been careless in how he handled the masturbation after the rejection. So leaning towards A.\n"
