When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she was in the same house. When she walked in during his masturbation, she got upset and is now distant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author said no to sex because they weren't in the mood, which is normal. It's okay to set boundaries in a relationship. However, the next part is where it gets tricky. Masturbating in front of the girlfriend, even if she walks in accidentally, might be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, so maybe she felt hurt or disrespected.\n\nI should think about communication. The author didn't mention discussing their boundaries about masturbation in the relationship. Maybe the girlfriend wasn't comfortable with him masturbating while she was nearby, especially after a situation where she tried to initiate intimacy and he declined. The act of masturbating after turning her down might feel like a rejection, even if it's just a coincidence that she walked in.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling neglected or her self-esteem being affected. She tried to be intimate and was rejected, and then later saw him getting his needs met without her. That could lead to feelings of insecurity or jealousy. The author might not have considered how that would make her feel, even if it wasn't intentional.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't do it intentionally. They were alone in the room, and she walked in. However, the fact that he was using a laptop might suggest he was in a private space, but if it's a shared living area, maybe he should have been more mindful of her presence. Also, the act of masturbating after declining her could be seen as insensitive, even if it's just a coincidence.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is allowed to have their own needs and might not have realized the emotional impact. The girlfriend's reaction is valid, but does that make the author in the wrong? It's possible they didn't communicate their boundaries, leading to misunderstandings. The author might need to apologize and explain, but the initial action might not be inherently wrong. However, the aftermath could be a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the girlfriend didn't know about his masturbation habits, then it's a new situation. But after turning her down, doing it in front of her might be hurtful. The key is whether they had prior discussions about such things. Without that, the author might not be in the wrong, but they could be if they didn't consider her feelings. The answer might depend on the relationship dynamics. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A or B. Given that the girlfriend's reaction is valid and the author didn't consider her feelings, maybe A (in the wrong) is the choice here. But if the author didn't do it on purpose, maybe B. Hmm."
