When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend and then masturbating when she caught him. They provided the Reddit-style question where the person is confused about their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author turned down his girlfriend's attempt at intimacy, which is fine if he wasn't in the mood. That part seems normal. Then later, he masturbated, which is a personal choice. However, when his girlfriend walked in, she was upset. The key issue here is privacy. If he was using the laptop, maybe she saw something explicit, which could be a privacy issue if he wasn't in a place where he should be doing that. But the problem is that she walked in on him, which might have caused her embarrassment or discomfort. \n\nBut why is she so upset? The author is confused. The girlfriend's reaction seems extreme, maybe because she felt disregarded or there's an issue with trust. If the author was using the laptop to watch something and she walked in, maybe she felt violated. Alternatively, maybe she thought he was watching something that shouldn't be in their shared space. However, masturbation is a private act, so doing it in a shared space (if that's the case) might be an issue. But if he did it in his own room, maybe not. The setup isn't clear. \n\nThe main question is whether the author did something wrong. If he was in a private space and using the laptop, maybe not. But if he was in a shared space and didn't consider her feelings about privacy, then maybe he is in the wrong. Also, the girlfriend's reaction is significant. She walked out and hasn't been talking to him. Perhaps she felt betrayed or that he was being disrespectful. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if it's a personal privacy matter, but if the act was in a place where she could stumble upon it, maybe he should have been more considerate. But the problem is that he's confused why she's upset. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author didn't consider her feelings about privacy or maybe she felt neglected. However, the act of masturbation itself isn't wrong if it's consensual and in private. The problem might be the context. If he was in a shared space and didn't close the door, he could be at fault for not respecting her privacy. Alternatively, if she walked in unexpectedly, maybe it's a mutual misunderstanding. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the circumstances of the environment. Since the author is using a laptop, maybe he was in a room where she could enter, which might not be private. So, the author might be in the wrong for not ensuring privacy. Alternatively, if he was in his own room, maybe not. But the girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that she felt hurt. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong if he didn't consider privacy boundaries, but if it was a private space, then not. Since the details are limited, the answer isn't clear-cut, but the girlfriend's reaction points to her feeling disrespected. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
