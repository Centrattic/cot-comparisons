When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's attempt at sex and then masturbating, which she found upsetting.\n\nFirst, the situation: They were home together. The girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but the author wasn't in the mood and said so. Then later, he masturbated, and she walked in on him, which led to an argument. The key points are communication and mutual respect.\n\nThe author says he wasn't in the mood and communicated that. That part seems okay because being honest about not being in the mood is important in a relationship. However, after she tried and he said no, maybe there should have been a discussion about why he wasn't in the mood or if there was something else going on. But he didn't mention any issues there beyond just not feeling it.\n\nThen, the masturbation part. The problem here is that he used his laptop, so maybe he was using a streaming service or something. The girlfriend walking in on him might have felt like a betrayal, even if he wasn't cheating. Masturbating in front of her could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of her feelings, especially after she had just been turned down. It might make her feel like he's not considering her presence or his actions could make her feel unimportant.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is a key point. She's upset, not talking, and visibly upset. Her feelings are valid. Even if he didn't do anything wrong in her eyes, his actions might have been hurtful. Maybe she felt rejected again or that he wasn't respecting her after she had tried to connect with him.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on their communication and understanding. If the author wasn't aware that his actions could be hurtful, then maybe he's not in the wrong, but he should consider her feelings. However, if they had discussed boundaries before, and he ignored them, then he's in the wrong.\n\nIn many relationships, using a laptop for that purpose in front of a partner could be seen as a privacy issue. Also, the fact that he masturbated after turning her down might make her feel like he's prioritizing his own needs over her feelings. So while he didn't cheat, the action could be perceived as disrespectful.\n\nThe answer here is tricky. If the girlfriend felt disrespected, then the author's action was wrong. But if there was no prior discussion about such things, maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should consider each other's feelings. So, even if he didn't mean to, his action was inconsiderate, which makes him at least partially at fault.\n\nSo I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions, while not cheating, might have been hurtful and disrespectful to his girlfriend's feelings, especially after she had been rejected earlier.\n"
