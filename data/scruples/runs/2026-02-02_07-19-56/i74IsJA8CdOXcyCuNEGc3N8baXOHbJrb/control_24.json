      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she was present. She got upset and hasn't been talking to him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and his girlfriend have been together for two years, both 21. He wasn't in the mood, so he turned her down. That's reasonable; people have different moods. Then, after two hours, he got horny and masturbated. When he did that, she walked in and was upset. \n\nNow, why is she upset? Maybe she felt rejected when he turned her down, and then seeing him masturbate might have made her feel even worse. Maybe she thought he was being dismissive or not considering her feelings. The key point here is about mutual respect and communication in the relationship. If he turned her down, maybe she needed some reassurance or communication about his feelings, instead of him then engaging in an activity that she might find hurtful or dismissive.\n\nAlso, when he was masturbating, she walked in. Depending on the relationship dynamics, this could be a boundary issue. If she didn't expect to see him doing that, it might have been a shock or made her feel uncomfortable. Maybe she felt embarrassed or felt like he wasn't respecting her presence. \n\nThe author doesn't see it as his fault, but maybe he overlooked her emotional state. After turning her down, she might have been feeling down, and his subsequent action might have amplified her feelings of rejection. It's possible that he didn't consider how his actions after refusal might affect her. \n\nOn the other hand, he wasn't in the wrong for not being in the mood. Everyone has off days. But the act of masturbating in front of her, especially after she was turned down, could be seen as insensitive. It's about how partners communicate and support each other's emotional needs. If the girlfriend felt disrespected or hurt, then the author might be at fault for not being more considerate post-refusal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the initial refusal isn't wrong, the subsequent action of masturbating, especially if it was in her presence and without consideration for her feelings, could be where he went wrong. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt hurt, and the author might not have been empathetic enough in that moment.\n"
