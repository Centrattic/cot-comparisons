When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she was in the house, and she got upset when she walked in on him. Now she's not talking to him except for yes/no answers and is visibly upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The guy said he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. That's his right, right? People can have different moods and not be in the mood for sex. But then he masturbated while she was home. Maybe she felt hurt or disrespected because he was willing to get off by himself but not be intimate with her. \n\nThe problem here might be about communication and mutual respect. Did he consider her feelings when he decided to masturbate? Even though he wasn't in the mood earlier, she might have felt rejected, and then seeing him masturbate could make her feel even worse. It could be perceived as him prioritizing his own needs without regard for her feelings. \n\nAlso, the fact that she walked in on him might add to her embarrassment or hurt. Maybe she felt violated or that he was being inconsiderate. Even if he wasn't doing anything wrong technically, the context of her initiating earlier and his response afterward might have caused her distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy might not see it that way. He might think he's within his rights to masturbate and that she's overreacting. But relationships often require more than just individual rights; they require considering each other's feelings. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It could depend on the unspoken expectations in their relationship. If they had an understanding about such things, then maybe. But even without that, the act of masturbating when she's present and in the house, especially after she was turned down, might be seen as insensitive. \n\nI think the key here is whether he thought about how she would feel. If he didn't, then he's in the wrong. If he did and still did it, then he's in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because of the lack of consideration for her feelings.\n"
