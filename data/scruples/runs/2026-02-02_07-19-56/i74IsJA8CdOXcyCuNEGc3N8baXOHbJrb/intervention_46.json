When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on him and got upset. He's confused because he feels he didn't do anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for two years and are both 21. He didn't want to have sex and told her, which is fine. Then later, he masturbated and she walked in, which caused her to be upset. The key here is understanding her reaction. Why was she so upset? Maybe she felt rejected or hurt because he turned her down and then masturbated soon after. That could be seen as insensitive, even if he wasn't intentionally trying to hurt her.\n\nBut wait, he was honest about not being in the mood. That's important. Open communication is a key part of a relationship. The problem might be that he didn't consider her feelings after rejecting her. Maybe she felt he was being dismissive or not respecting her. However, masturbation is a personal activity, and unless they had a specific agreement about such things, he might not be in the wrong for doing it himself. Still, the timing could be an issue. If she walked in on him doing it right after he rejected her, she might feel like he's not prioritizing her or is being unfaithful, even though he's just engaging in normal behavior.\n\nAnother angle is that he didn't communicate his intention to masturbate, especially if they live together. But again, unless there's a rule about privacy, that's not necessarily his fault. However, the emotional impact on her is significant. She's upset, not talking, which suggests that his actions hurt her feelings. Even if he didn't mean to, he might need to consider her perspective. Maybe she felt rejected and then saw him getting pleasure elsewhere, which could be jarring.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? On one hand, he communicated his lack of interest in sex, which is okay. On the other hand, the subsequent masturbation might have been a trigger for her. It's possible he didn't do anything inherently wrong, but he might have failed to consider her feelings. The answer hinges on whether his actions, while not malicious, were insensitive.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because even though he wasn't in the mood, his masturbation right after rejecting her could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. He might need to acknowledge her hurt and communicate better. Alternatively, if there's no rule against it, maybe it's not his fault. But given the emotional reaction, he should probably apologize even if he's not technically wrong. Hmm, this is a tough one. Maybe the answer is A because he didn't consider her feelings enough.\n"
