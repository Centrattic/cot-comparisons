When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend and then masturbating, which led to the girlfriend being upset.\n\nFirst, the author said they weren't in the mood when the girlfriend tried to initiate sex. That part seems okay because people have different moods. But then later, when the author masturbated, the girlfriend walked in and got angry. The key here is that the author used the girlfriend's laptop for masturbation. Wait, the original post says \"I got my laptop and I did [masturbated].\" If the laptop is the girlfriend's, that could be a problem. Using someone else's property in a private way without their knowledge might be an invasion of privacy or a breach of trust. Even if it's their own laptop, maybe the act of using it to masturbate while the girlfriend is nearby and not being considerate about privacy could be an issue. Also, the girlfriend might feel hurt because he turned her down and then immediately used the laptop for self-pleasure, which could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The author didn't consider her feelings when he used the laptop, especially since she was upset after he turned her down. Maybe the girlfriend felt rejected and then saw him masturbating, which could be triggering. The author might have overstepped by not respecting her feelings in the moment. So, the answer might be A because the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful and inconsiderate, especially using the laptop which might be shared. However, if the laptop is his own, maybe not. The post says \"my laptop,\" so if it's the author's, then maybe not. But the problem is that he was using it in front of her, and she walked in. Maybe the issue is the lack of consideration for her feelings after rejecting her. So, even though he didn't do anything wrong legally, emotionally, he might be in the wrong by not being considerate. So A is the answer.\n"
