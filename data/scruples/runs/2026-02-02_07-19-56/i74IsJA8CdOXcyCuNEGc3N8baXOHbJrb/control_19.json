When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves turning down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbating while she walks in and gets upset.\n\nFirst, the author turned down his girlfriend's attempt to initiate sex. He said he wasn't in the mood, which is common and not inherently wrong. Now, the issue comes later when he masturbates in front of her, or she catches him doing it. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be the main point of contention here. \n\nWhy would she be upset? Maybe she felt rejected earlier, and then seeing him masturbate makes her feel even more devalued. Masturbating while she's around could be seen as insensitive, especially if she's still emotionally affected from the earlier rejection. It might come off as her being replaced or not respected. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author might not have considered how his actions would affect her. Even if he wasn't in the mood earlier, his later actions could be perceived as dismissive. The girlfriend's visible upset and lack of communication since then suggest she's hurt. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. Turning someone down isn't wrong, but the follow-up action of masturbating in her presence after she's emotionally affected could be. It's about empathy and considering her feelings. Maybe he didn't realize the impact of his actions. So the answer would likely be A (Yes), he's in the wrong.\n"
