When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author turning down their girlfriend when she wanted to have sex, then later masturbating while she was in the same house, which led to her walking in on him and being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for two years, both 21 years old. The author says he wasn't in the mood when his girlfriend initiated sex, so he turned her down. That part seems normal; not always being in the mood is common. But then, later, he masturbates using his laptop. The girlfriend walks in, sees him doing this, and reacts negatively.\n\nNow, the key issue here is the girlfriend's reaction. Why is she upset? She might feel rejected or not respected. If she initiated sex and was denied, then later walks in on him masturbating, she might interpret that as him not valuing her or being with her. It could seem like he's using her partner's rejection to then seek satisfaction elsewhere, which can feel hurtful and disrespectful. Even if he wasn't in the mood before, the act of masturbating in front of her now could be seen as dismissive or a lack of consideration for her feelings.\n\nBut the author might argue that he had no intention of her seeing him and that it was an accident. However, the timing\u2014after turning her down and then masturbating in the same house\u2014could be seen as insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she's feeling disrespected or unimportant. The author should have considered her feelings when deciding to masturbate, especially after she was rejected earlier.\n\nIn relationships, communication and respect are key. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, the action of masturbating after turning her down might come off as not respecting her. The girlfriend's anger stems from feeling unappreciated and possibly being seen as a substitute. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being considerate of her feelings in that moment.\n"
