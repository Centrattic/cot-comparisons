When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about turning down their girlfriend for sex and then masturbating, which she found offensive.\n\nFirst, turning down a partner for sex isn't inherently wrong. People have different moods and needs, and it's important to communicate that. The author said he wasn't in the mood, so that part seems okay. But then he masturbated while she was around. The girlfriend walked in on him, which probably made her feel hurt or rejected. \n\nThe key points here might be about respect and consideration. Even if he wasn't in the mood for her, masturbating in the same room might be seen as dismissive. Maybe he should have been more considerate of her feelings, especially after she was already turned down. It's possible she felt he prioritized his own needs over hers, or that he was being hypocritical. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is strong, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. However, the fact that she's upset and he's confused suggests a communication breakdown. Maybe the author didn't consider how his actions might affect her, even if he didn't intend to hurt her. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit grey. The author didn't force anything or do anything illegal. But in a relationship, actions can have emotional impacts. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but could have been more considerate. The answer might be B, but I need to think if there's a cultural or relational norm that makes it wrong. In some contexts, using a partner's rejection and then engaging in self-pleasure might be seen as disrespectful. But others might say it's his right. \n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the action itself isn't necessarily harmful unless it's done in a way that's hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling hurt by the rejection and then seeing him get pleasure elsewhere. So the author might have been inconsiderate, but not necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
