When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex and later masturbated using a laptop. When his girlfriend walked in, she was upset and stopped talking to him. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author said no to sex because he wasn't in the mood. That part seems reasonable\u2014people can have days where they don't feel like being intimate. It's a common thing in relationships, and communication is key. The problem arises when he later masturbates in front of his girlfriend. Using a laptop suggests he might have been watching something explicit or using it for adult content. The girlfriend walked in mid-session, which could be embarrassing and hurtful, especially if she didn't know he was doing that. \n\nThe author's actions might have made his girlfriend feel rejected and then humiliated. Even if he didn't intend to be hurtful, the act of masturbating after turning her down could be seen as a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable\u2014she might feel that he prioritized his own needs over hers, especially after she tried to connect with him. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of privacy. If he was in his own room or a private space, maybe it's different. However, if he was in a shared area using a laptop, perhaps he should have been more discreet. The girlfriend walking in on him might have made her feel uncomfortable or like she was intruding. \n\nAnother angle is the communication between the couple. The author didn't explain his actions when she walked in, which could have exacerbated the situation. If he had clarified that he wasn't watching anything inappropriate and was just dealing with a natural need, maybe the reaction would have been different. But since he didn't, she's upset and he's confused. \n\nThe user is leaning towards the author being in the wrong. I need to consider cultural or societal norms here too. In some contexts, using a laptop for masturbation might be seen as disrespectful if it's done in a shared space without privacy. Also, the girlfriend might feel that after her rejection was respected earlier, his later actions were dismissive of her feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's main mistake might be not considering his girlfriend's feelings in the way he handled his own needs after turning her down. Even if his actions weren't malicious, they might have been careless. The answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because his actions could have been perceived as disrespectful and hurtful towards his girlfriend.\n"
