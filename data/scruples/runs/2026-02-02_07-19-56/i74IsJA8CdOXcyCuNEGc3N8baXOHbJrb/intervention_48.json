We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author turning down his girlfriend for sex and then later masturbating while she walked in on him. She got upset and isn't talking to him now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They've been together for two years, both 21. The author said no to sex initially because he wasn't in the mood. That part seems normal; people have moods and can't be up for it all the time. Not wanting to have sex isn't inherently wrong. Then, later, he felt like masturbating and did so using his laptop. When his girlfriend walked in, she was upset. \n\nNow, the key issue is why she was upset. Maybe she felt rejected twice: once when he said no to sex and again when he masturbated, perhaps feeling he was replacing her. Or maybe she didn't want him to masturbate while she was around, possibly seeing it as a breach of privacy or a sign of disrespect. Alternatively, she might be upset that he was engaging in self-pleasure in the same house, which could be a cultural or personal boundary issue.\n\nThe author's actions: turning down sex isn't wrong. Masturbating is a personal choice, but the context matters. If he was in his own room and she walked in, maybe privacy was an issue. However, if he was in a shared space, maybe she felt intruded upon. Also, the fact that he used his laptop might imply watching something, which could be a trigger if she walked in on explicit content.\n\nBut the author didn't mention anything about being explicit; maybe he's just masturbating, not watching anything. Still, the girlfriend's reaction is strong. The question is whether the author crossed a line. Since he turned her down earlier, maybe she felt rejected and the masturbation made her feel less important. Could he have been more considerate? Like, maybe he should have left the room if she wasn't feeling up to it, or communicated better.\n\nBut masturbation is a personal activity. Unless there's a prior agreement about privacy, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author might not have considered her feelings in that moment. If she walked into the room, maybe she didn't expect to see him doing that, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for masturbating, but perhaps he could have been more mindful of her feelings. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. The answer depends on the relationship dynamics. Since the girlfriend is upset, maybe the author should take responsibility for not considering her feelings. But the act itself isn't wrong. However, the way it was done might have disregarded her feelings, especially after rejecting her advances. Maybe the author is in the wrong because he could have been more thoughtful. Alternatively, the girlfriend's reaction might be overblown. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer could go either way. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might disagree. The key factors are communication, mutual respect, and understanding. If the author didn't discuss his actions with her, maybe he should have. So, perhaps he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings in that situation.\n"
