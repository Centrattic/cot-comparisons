When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is wrong here. The situation is that the author turned down their girlfriend for sex because they weren't in the mood, then later masturbated while she was around. When she walked in, she got really upset and hasn't been talking to him much since.\n\nFirst, refusing to have sex when she's trying to initiate isn't necessarily wrong. People have different moods and needs, and communication is key. The author did say they weren't feeling it, which is honest. But maybe there's more to it. If the girlfriend felt rejected, that's a valid emotion. Maybe they didn't talk it over enough. \n\nThen, the author masturbated while she was nearby. If she walked in on them doing it, that could be embarrassing or hurtful. Maybe she felt ignored or not considered in that moment. Masturbating when there's someone else around could be seen as a breach of trust or consideration, especially if they were in a shared space. \n\nBut wait, the author used a laptop. Maybe they were in their own room or a private area. The girlfriend walked in, but was that unexpected? Did the author think it was okay to do that in her presence? It's possible she felt excluded or not respected. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling him a \"dick\" and being upset. That suggests she feels hurt or disrespected. The author might not see the problem, but maybe they didn't consider her feelings in the situation. \n\nIs there a cultural or personal aspect here? Maybe they had an unspoken agreement about such things. If the author didn't communicate their need to masturbate or took it in a shared space without considering her presence, that's an issue. \n\nIn relationships, actions that might seem personal can affect the other person. Even if the author thinks it's their right to masturbate, doing so in a way that the partner finds uncomfortable or disrespectful can be a problem. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author didn't do anything illegal, but maybe they overstepped in terms of how they handled their needs without considering their girlfriend's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider their partner's feelings when they masturbated in her presence, leading to her hurt feelings. The refusal to have sex wasn't wrong, but the subsequent action of masturbating while she was around might have been the main issue.\n"
