When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he turned down his girlfriend for sex, then later masturbated while she walked in on him. She got upset and is now not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author said he wasn't in the mood and turned her down, which is his right. Then, he masturbated later. The issue is that she walked in on him doing that. Why is she upset? Maybe she feels rejected or that he's being selfish. Or maybe she thought he was prioritizing his own needs over hers, especially after she was turned down earlier.\n\nIs there an unspoken rule here? In some relationships, using a laptop to masturbate might be seen as private, but if she walked in, maybe she felt it was disrespectful. But why would she be upset about him masturbating? Unless there's some jealousy or insecurity. The author might not see it as a problem, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests there's an issue.\n\nAlso, the timing: after he turned her down, then he masturbates. She might feel he's not respecting her feelings or that he's using her for his own pleasure. But he didn't use her; he just had his own needs. Maybe she felt that if he's not in the mood for her, he shouldn't be in the mood for anything else. That's possible. \n\nAnother angle: communication. The author didn't explain why he was masturbating, and she might not have understood. If he had communicated that he needed some time alone, maybe she would have been less upset. But she walked in on him and reacted immediately.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, he didn't force anything. He expressed not being in the mood earlier, which is okay. Masturbating is a personal choice. The problem is the girlfriend's reaction. However, the way he did it might have been inconsiderate. Using a laptop might be obvious, and maybe he didn't consider her feelings if she walked in. But is that his fault? It's a private action, but the context of turning her down first could be a factor.\n\nIn relationships, actions can have different meanings. She might feel that his masturbation after rejecting her is dismissive or that he's not respecting her. On the other hand, he's not doing anything wrong by having his own needs. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because he didn't do anything inherently wrong, but there's a communication issue. However, depending on the relationship dynamics, maybe there's something to consider. But technically, he isn't necessarily at fault. The problem is more about the girlfriend's feelings and how to address them, not necessarily that he did something wrong.\n"
