When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend tried to initiate sex, but he wasn't in the mood and turned her down. Later, when he masturbated using his laptop, his girlfriend walked in, was upset, called him a \"dick,\" and stopped talking to him. The author is confused and doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author refused sex when his girlfriend initiated, which is his right. Then he masturbated, which is a personal activity. However, the girlfriend walked in on him, which might have caused embarrassment or hurt feelings. \n\nBut why is she so upset? Maybe she feels rejected or that he's being disrespectful. If he was using her laptop or it was a shared space, that could be an issue. Also, the fact that he was in the room where she could walk in might matter. But the story doesn't specify if he did anything wrong in terms of privacy. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the girlfriend felt that the author was prioritizing his own needs (masturbating alone) over their relationship. However, the author wasn't in the mood earlier, so this might not be directly related. \n\nCould the act of masturbating while she's around be an issue? If he didn't consider her feelings or if it's something she's uncomfortable with, maybe. But the story doesn't say he was hiding it or doing something inappropriate. \n\nThe author's actions: turning down sex is not wrong. Masturbating is personal. The problem arises when she walks in and he's doing it. Maybe she felt it was disrespectful to have him engage in a sexual activity alone when they weren't communicating well. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author didn't explain why he was masturbating later, and she might feel that he wasn't considering her feelings. However, the author didn't have the intention to hurt her when he masturbated. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for the actions themselves, but perhaps he should have communicated better. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. \n\nIf the girl walked in on him without knocking or expecting privacy, that's her issue. But if the author was in a space where she could walk in unannounced, maybe he should have locked the door. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl's reaction is disproportionate. The author's actions were personal and not harmful. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But if they had an unspoken agreement about privacy, that could be a factor. \n\nSince the story doesn't mention any prior issues about privacy or communication problems, it's hard to say. The author's actions don't inherently seem wrong, but the situation highlights a communication breakdown. The answer might depend on whether the author's masturbation was done in a way that respected the girlfriend's potential feelings. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for the actions described. He turned down sex appropriately and then engaged in a personal activity. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling rejected or not being considered. But the author didn't do anything to intentionally hurt her. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
