When we got inside she tried to initiate sex, but I wasn't in the mood so I said I wasn't feeling it. Don't get me wrong, she's beautiful and everything but I just wasn't up for it. We've been together for approximately 2 years now and we're both 21 if that matters.\n\nFast forward 2 hours. I got a little bit horny and I wanted to jerk off, so I got my laptop and I did. In the middle of the session my girlfriend walked into the room and looked at me like I shat in her shoes. She called me a dick and walked out saying some other stuff I couldn't hear. Since then she hasn't been talking to me outside of yes/no and she's visibly upset.\n\nAm I in the wrong here though? I don't feel like I did something wrong, and I don't know why she's so pissed over this.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down his girlfriend for sex when she initiated, then later masturbated while she was around. When she walked in and saw him, she got upset and stopped talking to him.\n\nFirst, the author said no to sex when she wanted it. Being in a relationship, communication is key. If he wasn't in the mood, maybe he should have explained better or checked in with her feelings. But he might not be wrong for not feeling up to it. People have different moods, right?\n\nThen he masturbated. The issue here is whether using the laptop made it seem like he was doing something separate from her. If she walked in and saw him doing that, maybe she felt rejected or like he was prioritizing his own needs over hers. Even if he wasn't with her, using a laptop might have been a trigger for her. The fact that she reacted so strongly suggests that she felt hurt or embarrassed.\n\nThe author might not realize how his actions made her feel. Maybe he didn't consider her perspective. If she was already upset from him turning down sex, the masturbation could have compounded her feelings of rejection. He needs to acknowledge her feelings and apologize. But the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, respect and consideration matter. Even if he's not doing anything illegal, his actions could have been insensitive. So, maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit split because he wasn't physically cheating. However, the emotional impact is there. Yeah, probably A because he didn't consider her feelings enough.\n"
