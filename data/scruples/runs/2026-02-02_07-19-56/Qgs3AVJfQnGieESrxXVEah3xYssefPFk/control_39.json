My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person has been playing guitar since they were 8, and this is their dream guitar, a specific vintage model. They bought it on a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't possible. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels their financial future is at risk. The author argues that the guitar's value will increase and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is also upset that the author won't sell it back, even though the store is offering to buy it.\n\nNow, considering the key points. Financial responsibility and communication in relationships are important. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their partner, which is a big part of the issue. Even though the guitar has sentimental value and potential to appreciate, using a credit card for a large purchase without considering the partner's concerns might be seen as irresponsible. The author's stance that they're not in the wrong because it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and they see credit cards that way might not take into account the partner's perspective on shared finances.\n\nIn relationships, especially when finances are shared, major purchases should be discussed. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave shows how serious she takes this. The author's dismissal of her concerns as \"panic\" and insisting that the partner is wrong about credit card use could be seen as dismissive of her valid financial worries. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's feelings and financial planning might make the author at fault here.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate and considered their own desires without considering the partner's financial concerns.\n"
