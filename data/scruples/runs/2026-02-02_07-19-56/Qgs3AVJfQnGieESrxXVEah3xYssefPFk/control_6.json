My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, which caused their fianc\u00e9e to threaten leaving. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the post. The author has been playing guitar since they were 8, so this is a long-standing passion. The guitar is a rare 1960s Gibson Les Paul, which they found online and immediately bought with a credit card. They didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, and now she's upset about the financial risk and the fact that they didn't talk about it.\n\nThe author's defense is that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that such guitars always appreciate in value. They also mention using a credit card for a large purchase, which they see as its intended use. The fianc\u00e9e feels that the purchase was reckless and that the author didn't consider their shared finances, leading to conflict.\n\nFinancial disagreements in relationships can be tricky. The main issue here is whether the author acted responsibly. Using a credit card with a high limit to buy an expensive item without discussing it with a partner might be seen as irresponsible, especially if it affects their shared financial future. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is valid because financial decisions in a relationship usually require mutual agreement, especially when large sums are involved. The author's argument about the guitar's value might be true in the long term, but the immediate financial strain and the lack of communication are points against them.\n\nThe author's refusal to sell the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's anger might escalate the conflict. While the guitar is a dream for the author, the method of purchase and the lack of consultation seem to be the main issues. The fianc\u00e9e's threat to leave shows how serious this is for her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author didn't communicate their decision, which is a significant part of relationship management. Even if the purchase seems justified to them, the impact on the relationship is a key factor. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of the lack of communication and financial planning. However, others might argue that pursuing a lifelong dream isn't wrong, hence B. But given the context of a relationship, the responsibility to discuss major purchases is important.\n"
