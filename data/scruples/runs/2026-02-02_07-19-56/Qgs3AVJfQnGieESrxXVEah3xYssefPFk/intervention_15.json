My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author made a mistake by buying a dream guitar on a credit card without consulting their fianc\u00e9, leading to a potential relationship conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They've had a lifelong dream of owning a specific guitar, found a rare opportunity, and used a credit card they've had since college. They argue that the guitar's value will increase and that credit cards are for such purchases. They don't see a financial risk because of the guitar's potential appreciation.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective: She's upset about not being consulted and feels the purchase endangered their financial future. She's also angry that the author won't sell it back even though the store offers to buy it. She disagrees with the use of the credit card for a non-essential item.\n\nKey factors to consider: Financial responsibility, communication in relationships, and differing values. The author acted on a personal dream without considering their partner's financial priorities. Even if the guitar is a valuable investment, using a high-limit credit card without discussing it could lead to debt or strain. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests she values joint financial planning and transparency, which is a valid concern in a committed relationship.\n\nThe author might argue that it's their money and their dream, but in a partnership, shared finances often require mutual agreement. The refusal to sell the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9's objections shows a lack of compromise. The author's stance that they're not in the wrong ignores the partner's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship.\n\nSo, while the guitar is a significant personal achievement, the way it was handled\u2014without discussion and using credit\u2014could be seen as irresponsible from the fianc\u00e9's viewpoint. The main issue here is the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's financial concerns. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting their fianc\u00e9 and dismissing her valid worries about their shared financial future.\n"
