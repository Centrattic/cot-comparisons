My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person has been playing guitar since they were 8, so it's a long-held passion. The guitar they bought is a specific model from before 1960, which they found online and had to buy immediately because they thought it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit, which they've had since college. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her, and they argue about financial responsibility. The person believes credit cards are for such purchases, while the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a risk and that the guitar's value might not guarantee future financial stability.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a simple A or B answer. Let's break it down.\n\nFinancial responsibility in a relationship often involves discussing major purchases. Even if they share finances, the fact that the purchase was made without consulting the partner is a point of contention. The author argues that the guitar is a dream item and that it's an investment since it appreciates. However, the fianc\u00e9 sees it as a risk and a disregard for their shared financial future.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their partner, which can lead to feelings of being excluded or not valued in financial decisions. Credit card use for a high-value item could lead to debt, especially if there's no plan to pay it off quickly. The argument about whether credit cards are for such purchases is subjective, but using a large portion of a credit limit on a single item might not be prudent.\n\nThe author's defense that the guitar's value will increase is speculative. While some collectibles do appreciate, it's not guaranteed, and relying on that as a financial safety net is risky. The fianc\u00e9's concern is about putting their future at risk, which is valid in a shared financial situation.\n\nSo, the author's mistake was not communicating with their partner before making a significant purchase and using credit which could affect their combined financial stability. Even if the purchase was a personal dream, in a committed relationship, both partners' financial goals and concerns should be considered. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering their partner's perspective and the potential financial implications on their relationship.\n"
