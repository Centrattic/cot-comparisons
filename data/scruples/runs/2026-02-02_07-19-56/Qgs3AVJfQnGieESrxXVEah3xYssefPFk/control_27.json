My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the author bought their dream guitar with a credit card, and their fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her. The key points here are about financial decisions in a relationship and whether the author acted inconsiderately.\n\nFirst, the author used a credit card with a $10,000 limit. They mention that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that they took financing into account. They also argue that the guitar's value is not a risk because it's a vintage item that appreciates. However, the fianc\u00e9e is upset about the financial risk and the lack of communication. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for making this purchase without discussing it with their partner. Financial decisions, especially large ones, typically require mutual agreement in a relationship. Even if the guitar is a dream item, spending a significant amount on a single purchase without considering the partner's perspective can be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. \n\nThe author defends their decision by saying credit cards are for buying things you can't afford on the spot, but using a large credit limit for a non-essential item (even if it's a passion) might be viewed as imprudent. Also, the fianc\u00e9e's concern about the financial future is valid; high-interest debt from a credit card can be risky if the guitar's value doesn't cover the cost or if there are other financial needs.\n\nAdditionally, the author's refusal to consider selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's anger shows a lack of willingness to compromise. The fact that the store is willing to buy it back but the author isn't using that option suggests they are entrenched in their decision without considering the partner's needs. \n\nIn relationships, communication and shared financial planning are usually important. The author's action might have been impulsive and not respectful of the partner's input. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the financial implications and the partner's feelings matter. So, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
