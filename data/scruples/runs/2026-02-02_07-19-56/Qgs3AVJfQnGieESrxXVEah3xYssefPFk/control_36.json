My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about buying a dream guitar with a credit card that has a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her and she's worried about the financial future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has had this dream guitar for a long time and saw a rare opportunity. They used a credit card to finance it, which they've had since college. They argue that credit cards are for such purchases and that the guitar's value will increase. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels her financial security is at risk and that the author didn't communicate with her. She's also upset that the author won't sell it back, even though the store offers to buy it.\n\nFinancial decisions often require communication in a relationship. Using a credit card for a luxury item, especially a large one, might be seen as irresponsible if it puts the relationship or shared finances at risk. The author didn't consult their partner, which is a big part of the issue here. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the way it was handled could be problematic. The fact that the author is doubling down and not willing to back down might exacerbate the situation.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The decision was made without discussion, 2) Using credit card debt for a non-essential item, 3) Disregarding the partner's concerns about financial future, and 4) Not being willing to compromise (like selling it back).\n\nIn many relationships, major purchases that affect shared finances should be mutual decisions. The author's stance that the fianc\u00e9 shouldn't \"panic\" might be dismissive of her valid concerns. Even if the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the financial implications and the lack of communication are significant. The fianc\u00e9's argument about financial responsibility and the risk involved is valid. The author might not be evil, but their actions did disregard the partner's feelings and financial partnership.\n\nSo, considering these factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate the purchase and used a credit card in a way that risks their shared financial stability, ignoring the partner's valid concerns.\n"
