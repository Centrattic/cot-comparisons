My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who bought the dream guitar was in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who is upset about the purchase.\n\nFirst, the author bought a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul with a credit card he's had since college. He mentions the guitar is a lifetime dream and that he couldn't pass up the opportunity. He used a credit card with a $10k limit, which might be a red flag. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because he didn't consult her, putting their financial future at risk. The author argues that since the guitar appreciates in value, it's not a risk and that using a credit card for big purchases is normal. The fianc\u00e9 disagrees and is upset he won't sell it back.\n\nNow, considering the key points. Financial decisions in a relationship often require communication and mutual agreement, especially when it's a significant expense. The author used a credit card with a high limit, which could lead to debt. Even if the guitar's value is supposed to appreciate, there's risk involved because market conditions can change. The fianc\u00e9 feels her concerns about financial security are valid, and the author dismissed her by suggesting he can sell it back, which might not be reliable if he's committed to keeping it.\n\nThe author's perspective is about pursuing a lifelong dream, but financial decisions should involve both partners. The fact that he didn't consult her is a major issue. Using credit to buy a high-value item without considering the other person's input or financial planning is problematic. Even if he sees it as a good investment, the fianc\u00e9's viewpoint is about shared responsibility and future planning. The argument over whether credit cards are for such purchases is a matter of differing financial priorities, but in a committed relationship, major purchases should be discussed.\n\nSo, the author likely acted impulsively without considering the fianc\u00e9's perspective, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
