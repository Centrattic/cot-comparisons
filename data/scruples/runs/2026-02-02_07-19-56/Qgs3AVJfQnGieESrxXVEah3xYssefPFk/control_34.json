My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, which is a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul. The fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave because they didn't consult her and used a credit card with a $10k limit. The author's defense is that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that these guitars always go up in value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. Using a credit card for a big purchase, especially a $10k item, can be risky because of high interest rates. The author might have thought of it as an investment, but if they're paying it off over time, that could lead to debt. The fianc\u00e9e is probably worried about their joint financial future, so not consulting her is a big issue in a relationship. Even if the author sees it as using the credit card for its intended purpose, the amount is substantial and could affect their shared finances.\n\nThen there's the argument about communication. In a serious relationship like a fianc\u00e9e, major purchases that impact shared finances should be discussed. The author didn't do that, which might have caused the fianc\u00e9e to feel disrespected. The fact that the store is willing to buy it back shows the author tried to reassure her, but the refusal to sell it now makes her feel the decision was unilateral.\n\nThe author's reasoning that the guitar is a good investment might be valid, but that's a personal opinion. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is about the immediate financial risk and the lack of communication. The key point here is whether the author acted responsibly by not discussing it beforehand. Even if the purchase was justified in their mind, the method of financing and lack of consultation could be seen as the author being in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
