My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought their dream guitar, a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, using a credit card with a $10k limit. Now their fianc\u00e9 is upset and threatening to leave them over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's side: they've been into music since they were 8, and this guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They see it as a good investment since these guitars appreciate in value. They took out a credit card to buy it, arguing that credit cards are for such purchases. They also mention that the store is willing to buy it back, which they think proves it's a safe investment.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: she's upset that the purchase wasn't discussed. She feels it's putting their financial future at risk for something frivolous. She's also upset that the author won't sell it back, which might imply they're stuck with the debt. She disagrees with the use of a credit card for this purchase, thinking it's not meant for such things.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. Even if the author believes the purchase is a good investment, making a large purchase without consulting their partner is a big deal. Financial decisions in a relationship usually require mutual agreement, especially when it involves significant debt. The fact that the author used a credit card with a high limit suggests that they might not be able to pay it off immediately, which could lead to financial strain. The fianc\u00e9's concern about the financial future is valid because credit card debt can be expensive with interest. The author's argument that the guitar is an investment might not hold if the market isn't as stable as they think, and relying on a resale might not be a guaranteed solution. Additionally, the author's refusal to consider selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9's anger could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's passion for music and achieving a lifelong dream is understandable. They might see this as a justified personal investment. However, in a committed relationship where finances are shared or at least discussed, making such a large decision unilaterally can be hurtful and irresponsible. The author might not be in the wrong from their own perspective, but in the context of the relationship, they may have failed to communicate and consider their partner's financial values and concerns. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author probably is in the wrong because they didn't discuss the purchase with their fianc\u00e9 and took on debt that could affect both of them. Even if the purchase seems justified to the author, the lack of communication and the potential financial impact on the relationship makes it a mistake.\n"
