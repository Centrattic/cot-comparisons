My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar that caused conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author has been playing guitar since they were 8, which is a long time. They found a rare, pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a significant purchase for a musician. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit, which might be a problem because using a large part of that limit on a single item could lead to debt. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her. Even if the author thinks the money is shared, not discussing a big purchase can be a major issue in a relationship. Financial decisions, especially big ones, usually require mutual agreement. The author mentions that the guitar is a \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity, but using credit card debt for that might not be wise financially. \n\nThe author argues that the guitar's value will increase, but that's an assumption. The fianc\u00e9's concern about financial risk is valid. Also, the author's refusal to sell it back to the store despite the fianc\u00e9's anger shows that they aren't willing to compromise, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author acted without consulting their partner, used credit card debt for a luxury item, and is not willing to compromise. These actions can be seen as inconsiderate and financially risky, which might make the author at fault. However, the author's passion for music and the significance of the guitar could be seen as a personal dream. But in relationships, communication and mutual financial planning are usually important. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
