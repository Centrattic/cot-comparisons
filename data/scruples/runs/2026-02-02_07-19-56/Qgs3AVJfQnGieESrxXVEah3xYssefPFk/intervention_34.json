My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar. The fianc\u00e9e is upset and threatening to leave over the purchase, so there's a relationship conflict here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has had a lifelong passion for the guitar since age 8, and this specific pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit, which was their own money, and they argue that the guitar's value will appreciate. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels their financial future is at risk. The author sees the purchase as justified, while the fianc\u00e9e feels it's irresponsible.\n\nThe main issue here is financial decision-making in a relationship. When couples are financially intertwined, major purchases can become a point of contention. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their fianc\u00e9e, which is a common point of conflict. Even if the money is technically separate, using a credit card with a large limit might affect their shared financial stability, depending on their agreement.\n\nThe author's argument that credit cards are for such opportunities is a point to consider. However, using a credit card with a high limit for a significant purchase without discussing it with their partner could be seen as dismissive of their partner's concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's fear of financial risk and the emotional impact of the purchase not being discussed are valid from her perspective.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. The answer depends on whether the couple has a financial agreement. If they're supposed to consult each other on major purchases, then the author didn't follow that agreement. If the money is separate and there's no prior agreement, the author might not be wrong. However, in relationships, communication is key, and not discussing a major purchase that could affect shared finances or cause emotional distress might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's threat to leave over this issue indicates that the purchase has caused significant stress. Even if the author believes in their own reasoning, the impact on the relationship is a factor. The author might not be entirely wrong, but the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's perspective could make them at least partially responsible for the conflict.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, the community often looks at whether the person acted with consideration for others. Here, the author didn't consider their partner's feelings or financial concerns, which is a red flag. The fact that the purchase was impulsive and not discussed suggests they prioritized their own desires without acknowledging the partner's valid concerns. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
