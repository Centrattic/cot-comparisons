My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote an AITA post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, which led to their fianc\u00e9 threatening to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The author is 22, has been playing guitar since 8, and had a lifelong dream of owning a vintage Gibson. They found a rare, high-value guitar and bought it with a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't available. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels the purchase jeopardizes their financial future. The author argues that the guitar is an investment and that credit cards are for such purchases, but the fianc\u00e9 disagrees.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are financial decisions, communication in the relationship, and the value of the item.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've had this dream for a long time, and the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They believe it's an investment that will appreciate, and they used a credit card to buy it, which they see as intended use. However, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss it, which is a common issue in relationships where financial decisions are made without mutual agreement. \n\nFinancial experts often advise that major purchases, especially those involving debt, should be discussed with a partner to avoid conflict. The fact that the author used a credit card with a 10k limit might be seen as risky if they can't pay it off quickly, leading to potential interest charges and debt accumulation. Even if the guitar's value is expected to increase, the timing and ability to sell it to pay off the credit card could be uncertain, which the fianc\u00e9 might see as a risk.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the store is willing to buy it back, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset that they refused to sell. This shows a lack of compromise and consideration for her feelings. The author might be prioritizing their own desires over the partner's concerns, which can strain a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not see it as a problem because it's a personal dream and they believe in their financial judgment. However, in a committed relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9, major financial decisions usually require mutual discussion. The absence of communication here is a significant point. The author may have acted on impulse without considering their partner's perspective, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate in the context of a relationship. They didn't consult their partner, took on debt that could affect their shared financial future, and didn't address their partner's concerns. Even if the purchase is justified as an investment, the method and lack of communication could be where they're in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just the fianc\u00e9's reaction. The author's failure to communicate and consider their partner's concerns could be the main issue, so the answer is A.\n"
