My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar was wrong. The situation is that the author bought a dream guitar using a credit card with a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult each other about the purchase, and she's worried about the financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is a sound investment since it's a vintage item that always increases in value, and that using a credit card is normal for such purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility in relationships. When couples are in a serious relationship like engaged, financial decisions that affect both partners should be discussed. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a red flag. Even if the author sees it as their money, shared finances often require mutual agreement to avoid conflicts.\n\nNext, the reasoning about the guitar's value. The author says it's a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a rare and valuable item. But while vintage guitars can appreciate, there's always a risk in any investment. The market can fluctuate, and the guarantee isn't absolute. The author might be overestimating the guitar's future value, which could lead to financial strain if they need to sell it later for less than expected.\n\nUsing a credit card for a large purchase is generally not advisable. High-interest rates on credit cards can lead to debt that's hard to repay. The author's fianc\u00e9e is concerned about this, and it's valid. Even if the author plans to sell the guitar later, there's no certainty about the timing or price. This could lead to long-term debt issues.\n\nThe author's response to the fianc\u00e9e's concerns is also a point. The fianc\u00e9e feels her worries are dismissed, especially when the author mentions the store is willing to buy it back. This shows a lack of empathy and consideration for her feelings. The author's stance that they're not getting rid of the guitar reinforces the idea that they didn't take her feelings into account.\n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The author's actions led to a major conflict without prior discussion. While the guitar is a personal dream, the way the purchase was handled could be seen as selfish, especially when it impacts shared financial stability. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is a consequence of not being involved in the decision-making process.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's perspective, used a high-risk financial method (credit card), and dismissed her concerns. These factors suggest that the author was wrong in how they handled the purchase, even if the purchase itself might have been a personal dream.\n"
