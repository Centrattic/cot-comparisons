My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying their dream Gibson Les Paul guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, leading to the fianc\u00e9e threatening to leave. The main points here are about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author spent a significant amount on a credit card with a $10k limit. They mention that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime find and that they couldn't pass up the opportunity. They also argue that these guitars always increase in value, so it's not a financial risk. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss the purchase and she feels it jeopardizes their future. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. From a financial standpoint, using a credit card for such a large purchase, especially if it's a high-interest card, could be problematic. Even if the guitar appreciates, the debt incurred might not be worth it, and the timing or need for that debt could strain their relationship. \n\nThe bigger issue here is communication. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e before making the purchase, which is a major expense. In a relationship, especially when considering marriage, sharing major financial decisions is important. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about joint financial planning and trust. The author's reasoning about credit cards being for \"once-in-a-lifetime\" purchases might not align with their fianc\u00e9e's values or financial plan. \n\nSo, while the author might not be entirely wrong in wanting to fulfill their dream, the lack of communication and the method of financing (credit card) could be seen as irresponsible. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, though extreme, is about feeling excluded from financial decisions and perceiving risk. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes), because the author didn't communicate the big purchase and used a credit card which could create financial stress, even if the item is a dream asset. The key is that financial decisions in a relationship should be mutual.\n"
