My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar was in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9e is upset about the purchase because they didn't consult her and used a credit card with a high limit. The author justifies it by saying it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that the guitar will appreciate in value.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility in relationships. When two people are engaged, especially planning to be married, financial decisions that affect both partners should ideally be discussed. Using a shared credit card with a high limit without consulting the partner could be seen as not considering their joint financial future. Even if the author thinks the guitar is a sound investment, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that it's a risk and a drain on their resources.\n\nThe argument about credit cards being for purchases you can't afford is a common one. However, responsible use includes not overspending and considering the long-term implications. The author's stance is that the guitar is worth it, but the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a reckless expense. The key here is communication and mutual agreement on financial decisions. \n\nSince the author didn't consult their partner and the purchase has caused significant distress, it might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the way it was handled\u2014without discussion\u2014could be the main issue. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is valid because financial decisions in a relationship often require teamwork. The author's refusal to consider selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's objections might exacerbate the problem, showing a lack of willingness to compromise.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's concerns is crucial. The author might not be \"wrong\" in wanting the guitar, but the method of purchasing it without discussion and the resulting conflict likely places them in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's feelings about financial security and shared responsibility are important aspects here. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the main issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's perspective.\n"
