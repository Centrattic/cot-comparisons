My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong, given their fianc\u00e9's reaction. So, the main points here are about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the person has been wanting this guitar for a long time, since they were 8 years old. They found a rare and specific model, which they felt was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit, which they had since college, to purchase it. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her and feels it's a financial risk. The person argues that the guitar will appreciate in value and that credit cards are for big purchases.\n\nHmm, so the key issues here are financial decisions and communication. The person didn't discuss the purchase with their partner, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. Even if the purchase seems justified to them, not involving the partner can lead to feelings of being disregarded. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that spending on a credit card for a non-essential item is risky, especially if they have other financial obligations. The person might see it as an investment, but the fianc\u00e9 might see it as an unnecessary expense that could jeopardize their financial stability.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, big purchases that affect shared finances should be discussed together. Even if the person believes they're making a smart investment, not consulting the partner could be seen as dismissive of their financial concerns. The fianc\u00e9's anger is understandable because it's about trust and shared responsibility. The author's response that they won't sell the guitar back shows they're not willing to compromise, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might argue that it's a personal dream and that the purchase is an investment. However, using a credit card for a high-value item can be risky, especially if they can't pay it off immediately, leading to interest charges. The fianc\u00e9's fear of financial instability is valid, and not addressing her concerns shows a lack of consideration for her perspective.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate the big purchase decision with their partner, which is crucial in a committed relationship. Financial decisions, especially large ones, should be made jointly to maintain trust and mutual respect. Even if the purchase is a personal dream, the way it was handled without discussion could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate.\n"
