My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author bought a rare guitar (pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul) using a credit card with a $10k limit. They mention it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and believe the guitar's value will increase. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that credit cards are for such purchases and that the guitar isn't a risk since it's an investment.\n\nNow, considering the financial aspect. Using a credit card for a high-value item that's not an emergency might be risky, especially if it's maxing out the credit limit. Credit cards typically have high interest rates, so if the author can't pay it off immediately, that could lead to debt. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial future is valid because such a purchase could strain their finances, especially if the guitar's value isn't as stable as claimed. While the author thinks the guitar is an investment, the market for vintage guitars can be volatile, and there's a risk it might not appreciate as expected.\n\nCommunication is another key point. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a major point of contention. In a relationship, major financial decisions usually require discussion, especially when using shared funds. Even if the money is technically joint, the fact that the author went ahead without discussing it could be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns.\n\nThe author's response to the fianc\u00e9e's anger\u2014mentioning the buyback option\u2014might further escalate the situation. It could be interpreted as trying to prove a point rather than addressing her emotional concerns. Also, the author is unwilling to sell, which shows they aren't considering her feelings or the relationship's well-being over the guitar.\n\nOn the other hand, the guitar is a lifelong dream, and the author's passion for music is genuine. The purchase was made for a significant, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, which adds context. However, the method of financing and the lack of communication are critical issues here.\n\nIn relationships, financial disagreements often stem from differing values. The author prioritizes personal fulfillment and investment, while the fianc\u00e9e prioritizes financial security and shared decision-making. Both have valid perspectives, but the author's actions\u2014making a large purchase without discussion\u2014may have been inconsiderate of the partner's financial concerns.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating and for using credit in a way that creates financial strain. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, while strong, is rooted in valid concerns about their shared future. Therefore, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
