My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong, especially since their fianc\u00e9e is upset about it. The author argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime investment that will appreciate and that using a credit card for big purchases is normal. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult each other about finances and feels financial stability is at risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is financial decision-making without consulting a partner. Even if the author believes the purchase is justified, the fact that the fianc\u00e9e is a partner in the relationship means that major purchases, especially those involving significant debt, should be discussed. The argument about credit cards being for big purchases might be valid in some contexts, but using a credit card with a high limit for a $10k item could be risky, especially if the couple isn't aligned on financial planning.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial future is valid. If they're planning to marry, major debt decisions should be mutual. The author's stance that it's their money might overlook shared financial responsibilities. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the way it was purchased\u2014without discussion and using credit\u2014could be seen as irresponsible from the partner's perspective.\n\nThe author mentions that the store will buy it back, but that's not a solid argument if the intention was never to sell. The core issue is communication. The author didn't consult, leading to conflict. So, while the purchase itself isn't inherently wrong, the lack of communication and financial planning with the fianc\u00e9e likely places the author in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
