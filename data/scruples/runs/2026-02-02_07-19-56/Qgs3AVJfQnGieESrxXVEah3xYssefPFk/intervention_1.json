My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e and using a credit card with a high limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset and threatening to leave over this.\n\nFirst, the key points here are financial decisions in a relationship. The author bought a significant item on credit without discussing it with their partner. The fianc\u00e9e feels her financial future is at risk. The author believes the guitar is a low-risk investment because it's a classic model that appreciates in value. They also mention that the store is willing to buy it back, but they don't want to sell it. The author's reasoning is that credit cards are for such purchases when you can't afford it upfront, but the fianc\u00e9e disagrees.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. In relationships, financial decisions often require communication and mutual agreement. Even if the author sees this as a one-time opportunity, using a credit card with a high limit (which implies debt) without consulting their partner could be a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is valid because taking on debt can affect both partners' future, especially if they're planning to be together long-term. The argument that the guitar is a sound investment might not matter if the fianc\u00e9e isn't on board. Dismissing her concerns by saying they should just disagree could be seen as not respecting her viewpoint. \n\nThe author's actions might be considered selfish or inconsiderate because they prioritized their personal dream without considering the partner's financial perspective. Even if the author believes the guitar is a good investment, the method of financing it without discussion could be the main issue. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests that this purchase has deeper implications for their relationship's stability. So, the author's decision not to consult and using credit without discussion is likely the main point of contention. \n\nIn many relationships, major purchases require mutual agreement. The author's dismissal of the fianc\u00e9e's concerns (\"she shouldn't panic\", \"we just have to disagree\") shows a lack of willingness to address the partner's valid worries. Therefore, the author's actions led to conflict and could be seen as the wrong thing to do.\n"
