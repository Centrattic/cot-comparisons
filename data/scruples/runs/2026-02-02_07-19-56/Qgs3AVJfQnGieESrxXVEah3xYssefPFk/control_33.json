My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, causing a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author is 22, has been playing guitar since 8, bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul they considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a 10k limit, and the fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar appreciates in value and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e wants them to sell it back but the author refuses.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial decisions in a relationship, communication, and differing values. The author made a significant purchase without discussing it with their partner, which is a common point of contention. The fianc\u00e9e feels her input was disregarded, which is a valid concern. Even if the author believes the purchase is wise, the lack of communication is a key factor. Financial decisions, especially large ones, typically require mutual agreement in a committed relationship like a fianc\u00e9e situation. The fact that the author is unwilling to compromise (not selling it) and dismisses the fianc\u00e9e's concerns might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and priorities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's passion for the guitar and seeing it as a long-term investment could be understood. However, the method of purchasing without discussing it first is problematic. The use of a credit card for a high-value item might also be a point of contention if it leads to debt or financial strain. The author's stance that credit cards are for such purchases might not align with the fianc\u00e9e's financial planning, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the key is the communication breakdown and financial responsibility. While the purchase itself isn't inherently wrong, making a large financial decision without consulting a partner, especially a fianc\u00e9e, can be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e's feelings about shared financial future are valid, and the author's refusal to engage in compromise (like selling it back) exacerbates the issue. Therefore, the author's actions are inconsiderate of their partner's perspective, making them at least partially at fault. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they failed to communicate and considered the purchase without mutual agreement, which is a significant issue in relationships.\n"
