My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is 22, has been playing guitar since 8, and bought a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul. They used a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't an option. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and sees it as a financial risk. The author argues that these guitars always appreciate and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e wants them to sell it back but the author refuses.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In many relationships, especially when engaged, financial decisions that impact both partners should be discussed. The author didn't communicate this big purchase, which could lead to feelings of being excluded or not trusted. Using a credit card for a high-value item might be seen as risky if it's not paid off immediately, leading to debt. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about the financial future is valid because unexpected expenses or changes in income could affect their ability to pay off the credit card.\n\nThe author's defense includes the argument that the guitar appreciates in value. However, while some collectibles do appreciate, there's always a risk involved. The market for vintage guitars can be volatile, though the author is confident. Still, relying on an investment to cover expenses isn't always wise.\n\nThe refusal to sell the guitar back even when the store offers to buy it shows commitment to the purchase, which might not be helpful in de-escalating the situation. The fianc\u00e9e's anger stems from feeling ignored and the sudden financial strain. The author's stance that they're not in the wrong might make the fianc\u00e9e feel unheard, which is a common source of conflict in relationships.\n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement, especially when using shared resources or taking on debt. Even if the author used their own credit card, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that joint financial responsibilities are at stake. The key issue here is communication and considering each other's perspectives. The author didn't consult the fianc\u00e9e, which is a breach of trust and could be seen as selfish, especially if the fianc\u00e9e wasn't aware of the potential risks.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author acted on their dream, which is understandable, but the method\u2014without discussion and using credit\u2014might have been the problem. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is a valid response to feeling that her concerns were dismissed. So, the author might be partially at fault for not considering the fianc\u00e9e's financial concerns and for not communication the purchase. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
