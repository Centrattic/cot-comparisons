My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. So the situation is that the fianc\u00e9e is upset because he bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul with a credit card, didn't consult her, and now she's threatening to leave. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. He used a credit card with a $10k limit. If the guitar cost a significant portion of that, say, $8k, then the credit card debt could be a problem. High-interest debt can definitely affect financial stability. But he argues that credit cards are for such purchases. However, using a credit card for a luxury item that isn't a necessity might not be prudent, especially if it leads to debt.\n\nThen there's the relationship angle. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he didn't consult her. In many relationships, major purchases are discussed together, especially when it affects shared finances. Even if they don't have a strict budget, not talking to her about such a big buy could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. The fact that she's threatening to leave shows how serious this is to her.\n\nHe mentions that the guitar is a dream item he's wanted since childhood. That's understandable, but the timing and how he went about it matter. He might have a valid passion, but the way he handled it\u2014without her input\u2014could be the issue. The fianc\u00e9e's argument is about financial responsibility versus fulfilling a personal dream. It's a common conflict where both sides have valid points, but the lack of communication is a key factor here.\n\nAlso, the part about the store buying it back but him refusing to sell it now shows he's adamant about keeping it, which might make her feel unheard. She might feel that he's prioritizing his own desires over their joint financial planning. Even if the guitar is an investment, the risk of debt from a credit card with high interest could outweigh the potential value increase.\n\nSo, considering all these points, while his passion for the guitar is valid, not discussing the purchase with his fianc\u00e9e and using credit card debt for a luxury item might be seen as irresponsible from her perspective. The main issue here is the lack of communication and the financial risk involved. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the financial partnership in the relationship.\n"
