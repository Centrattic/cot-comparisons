My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting to buy a dream guitar, which is a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, using a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult each other about the purchase and feels the financial future is at risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The couple's financial management is a big point. If they're in a committed relationship, especially engaged, big purchases should probably be discussed. The author argues that credit cards are for such purchases and that the guitar's value will go up. The fianc\u00e9e disagrees, feeling it's a risk and they should have consulted each other.\n\nThe author's actions led to conflict. They didn't communicate the purchase, which is a significant expense. Even if the item is a dream purchase, the financial implications for the couple as a whole matter. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about the financial future is valid because using credit cards for large, non-essential purchases can lead to debt, especially if the item's value appreciation is speculative.\n\nThe author might not be \"in the wrong\" if they have prior agreements about personal purchases. However, since they're engaged, it's reasonable to expect mutual financial decisions. The lack of communication is a problem. So, even if the author didn't intend to be an asshole, the action of not consulting caused harm. That makes me think the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author didn't consider their partner's perspective and the financial partnership.\n"
