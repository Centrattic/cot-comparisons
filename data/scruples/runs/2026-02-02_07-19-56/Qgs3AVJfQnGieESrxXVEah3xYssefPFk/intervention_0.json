My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 being upset about a large purchase made without consultation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author spent a significant amount on a dream guitar using a credit card. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't discuss it, and the author thinks it's a good investment. The fianc\u00e9 feels the purchase risks their financial future and is frustrated the author didn't consult them. The author argues that credit cards are for such purchases and that the guitar's value will increase.\n\nNow, thinking about financial responsibility in relationships. Even if the money is joint, major purchases without discussion can cause issues. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective, which is about shared financial decisions. The argument about credit card use might not hold if the purchase is risky or not a necessity. Also, the author mentions the store will buy it back, but that might not matter if the relationship is strained.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because financial decisions, especially big ones, should be mutual. The author's justification about personal dreams versus shared resources is a common conflict. The author's refusal to sell and insistence on using credit cards for this might be seen as dismissive of financial prudence and the other person's concerns.\n\nSo, even if the guitar is a dream item, not consulting the partner and using credit in a way that could strain finances might make the author at fault. The answer is A.\n"
