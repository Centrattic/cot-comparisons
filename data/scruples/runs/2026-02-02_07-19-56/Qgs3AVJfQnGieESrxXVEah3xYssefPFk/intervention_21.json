My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, leading to a fight with their fianc\u00e9e. They want a yes or no answer based on the given scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is 22, has been playing guitar since 8, and wanted a specific vintage guitar. They bought it on a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't possible. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar holds value and credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is also upset that the author won't sell it back, even though the store offers to buy it.\n\nNow, considering the key points. Financial decisions in a relationship, especially when using shared resources or credit, can be a point of contention. The author used a credit card that's been in their possession since college. But if the card is in their name and the fianc\u00e9e isn't a co-signer, maybe the author is right in thinking it's their money. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not consulting their partner. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that the purchase puts their financial future at risk. Even if the guitar might appreciate, there's risk involved in using credit. The author's argument that credit cards are for \"once in a lifetime\" purchases is a point of contention. Typically, credit cards shouldn't be used for large, non-essential purchases without considering the partner's input, especially if it's a significant amount (like $10k). \n\nBut the author's stance is that it's their dream and the guitar is a good investment. However, the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a risk. The author didn't consult her, which is a big deal in a relationship. Financial decisions involving shared money or potential debt can affect both partners. Even if the author used their own credit card, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that since they're engaged, their financial decisions should be a joint effort. \n\nThe author might be seen as inconsiderate by not discussing such a big purchase. Even if they have their own credit card, the relationship aspect is important. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction could be valid because the purchase affects their joint financial planning. However, the author might feel their dream is important and valid. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But typically, not discussing a large purchase that could impact the relationship's finances is often seen as a mistake. So the author might be in the wrong for not consulting their partner, even if the purchase itself is understandable. The answer could lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's concerns.\n"
