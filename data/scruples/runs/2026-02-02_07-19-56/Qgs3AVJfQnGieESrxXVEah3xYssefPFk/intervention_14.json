My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar that led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author is 22 and has been playing guitar since 8. They bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul on credit, which their fianc\u00e9e is upset about. She's threatening to leave because he didn't consult her and used a credit card with a $10k limit. He argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that it's a good investment since these guitars appreciate. She's worried about financial risk and doesn't agree with using credit for such purchases.\n\nNow, considering the situation. Financial decisions in a relationship often require communication and mutual agreement. The author didn't consult his fianc\u00e9e, which is a big part of the issue. Even if he believes it's a good investment, spending a significant amount on a personal dream without discussing it with a partner can be seen as dismissive of their concerns. The use of a credit card, which implies debt, adds to the financial risk. While the guitar might be a dream item for him, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about financial stability and shared responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are: failure to communicate, financial implications, and differing views on priorities. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in terms of personal desires, but in a relationship, shared financial decisions are important. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is valid because she feels her input was ignored. So, while the author's actions might not be malicious, the lack of consultation and consideration for their joint financial future could make him at fault. The answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the communication breakdown and financial risk without mutual agreement.\n"
