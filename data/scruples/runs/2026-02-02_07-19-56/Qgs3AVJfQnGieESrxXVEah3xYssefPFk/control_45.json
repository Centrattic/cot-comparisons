My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Should I feel bad for buying my dream guitar\" post is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he didn't consult her and used a credit card with a $10k limit to buy a vintage Gibson Les Paul. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has a long history with the guitar, it's his dream. He argues that the guitar's value always increases and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about not being consulted and the financial risk. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big factor. Using a credit card for a high-value item, especially one that's a luxury, can be risky. Even if the guitar appreciates, there's no guarantee. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about putting their financial future at risk is valid because credit cards have high interest rates. Even if the author plans to pay it off, not discussing such a large purchase with a partner can strain the relationship.\n\nCommunication is another point. The author didn't consult his fianc\u00e9e, which led to conflict. In many relationships, significant purchases require mutual agreement, especially when using shared funds or credit that affects both partners' financial health.\n\nThe author's reasoning that the guitar is a good investment might be optimistic, but it's not a sure thing. Vintage items can lose value if the market changes. Also, the fianc\u00e9e feels that the purchase was frivolous, which is a difference in values.\n\nThe author's response to the fianc\u00e9e's concerns by mentioning the store's buyback option seems dismissive. It might come off as not taking her concerns seriously. The refusal to sell the guitar despite her anger is another point where he's prioritizing his desires over her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, managing finances together is crucial. The author's stance that he's not wrong because it's his dream and the guitar's value might go up doesn't address the emotional and practical aspects of shared financial responsibilities. \n\nSo, while the author can be passionate about his interests, the lack of communication and the financial risk involved in using a credit card for a high-value personal item without consulting his partner likely places him in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is valid, and the author's actions have caused conflict by not respecting her input and the shared financial implications.\n"
