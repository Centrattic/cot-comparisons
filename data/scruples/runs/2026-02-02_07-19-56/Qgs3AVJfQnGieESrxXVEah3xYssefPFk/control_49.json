My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar that their fianc\u00e9e is upset about. The situation is that the author spent a significant amount on a vintage Gibson Les Paul using a credit card, and the fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has had a lifelong passion for the guitar and saw this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card they had for college, which has a high limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels this puts their financial future at risk. The author argues that the guitar's value will increase and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e disagrees and is now upset that the author isn't selling it back.\n\nFinancial responsibility is a key point here. Using a credit card for a high-value item can lead to debt, especially if the card's limit is maxed out. Even if the guitar appreciates, the interest on the credit card debt could be a significant financial burden if not paid off quickly. The author might not have considered the implications of using credit for such a purchase, especially without discussing it with their partner.\n\nIn relationships, shared financial decisions are often important. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that major purchases should be discussed, especially when they involve significant debt. The fact that the author didn't consult her could be seen as a breach of trust or lack of communication. While the guitar is a personal dream, the way it was financed and the lack of discussion could be the main issues here.\n\nThe author mentions that the store is willing to buy it back, but the fianc\u00e9e is upset that they won't sell it. This might indicate that the author is doubling down on their decision, which could be seen as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9e's concerns. The argument about credit card use versus financial planning is also a point of contention. The author's perspective that credit cards are for such purchases might not align with the fianc\u00e9e's view of financial responsibility.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author acted on a personal dream without considering the financial implications and the partner's input. While having dreams is valid, the method of financing and lack of communication could be where the mistake lies. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, while strong, is about financial planning and partnership. So, the author might be at fault for not discussing the purchase and using credit in a way that creates debt without considering the shared financial future.\n"
