My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong, given their fianc\u00e9's reaction.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has wanted a vintage Gibson Les Paul for a long time. They found a rare one and bought it on a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The person argues that the guitar appreciates in value and that credit cards are for such purchases. They also mention the guitar store offers to buy it back, but they won't sell it now. They're not looking for relationship advice but whether they were wrong.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author made a significant purchase using a credit card, which might lead to debt. Even if the guitar is a dream item, using a credit card for a high-value item that can't be paid off immediately could be risky, especially if it strains shared finances. The fianc\u00e9's concern is about the financial future, which is valid. The author didn't consult her, which is a big no-no in relationships. Financial decisions, especially large ones, should be discussed together when you're engaged and planning a shared future.\n\nThe author's reasoning that credit cards are for such purchases is a bit of a stretch. Credit cards are meant for convenience and building credit, but using them for unaffordable items isn't advisable. Plus, the argument that the guitar's value will increase doesn't account for market fluctuations or the emotional value versus financial prudence. The fianc\u00e9's anger stems from feeling that her partner prioritized a personal dream over their shared financial stability without discussion.\n\nSo, considering these factors, the author didn't act irresponsibly in pursuing their dream, but they did act inconsiderately by not involving their fianc\u00e9 in the decision. Financial decisions that impact the relationship should be mutual. The answer is A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and took a financial risk that affects their partner without discussion.\n"
