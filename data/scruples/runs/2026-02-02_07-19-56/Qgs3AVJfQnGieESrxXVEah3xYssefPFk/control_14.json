My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author bought a dream guitar, a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, using a credit card with a $10,000 limit. Their fianc\u00e9e is upset and threatening to leave over this purchase.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The author used a credit card for a significant purchase. Credit cards typically have high interest rates, so if they can't pay it off quickly, that could lead to debt. The fianc\u00e9e is concerned about financial stability and the risk involved. The author argues that the guitar is an investment since it's a classic model that appreciates in value. But not everyone might agree; some people see collectibles as investments, but others might view them as speculative or risky, especially if the market for such guitars isn't stable. \n\nThen there's the communication issue. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e before making the purchase, which is a big deal in a relationship. Money is a common source of conflict, and not discussing major purchases can lead to hurt feelings and mistrust. The fianc\u00e9e feels that the author didn't consider their shared financial future and made a unilateral decision. The author's response that \"our money is our money\" might not address the emotional aspect of feeling excluded from important decisions.\n\nThe author mentions that they tried to get financing but couldn't, so they used the credit card. However, using a credit card for a high-value item that might not be paid off immediately could be seen as imprudent. The fianc\u00e9e's anger is compounded by the fact that the author won't sell it back, even though they had mentioned the store would buy it, which might have been a way to reassure her but instead added to the conflict.\n\nThe author believes they're not in the wrong because the purchase was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for their dream guitar. They also think credit cards are for such purchases. However, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that this is a risk and shows a lack of financial responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all these points: using a credit card for a large purchase without considering the interest, not communicating with their partner, and the potential financial strain, it seems like the author might have acted irresponsibly from their partner's viewpoint. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the method of purchase and lack of discussion could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The key factors here are financial responsibility and communication in the relationship.\n"
