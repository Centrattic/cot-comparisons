My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, leading to a potential breakup.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author spent $10k on a vintage guitar, using a credit card. They mentioned it's their lifelong dream, and the guitar is an investment that might appreciate. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about not being consulted and the financial risk. The author thinks credit cards are for such purchases, but the fianc\u00e9e disagrees. The author isn't backing down and won't sell the guitar.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Financial decisions often require communication. Even if the author believes it's a safe investment, the fact that they didn't discuss it with their fianc\u00e9e is a major issue. In committed relationships, especially with shared finances, big purchases should be mutual. The author's dismissive attitude (\"we just have to disagree\") might be seen as not valuing the fianc\u00e9e's concerns. \n\nThe argument isn't just about the purchase itself but about respect and communication. The author's fianc\u00e9e feels her financial priorities are being ignored. The author's stance that \"our money is our money\" might imply a lack of consideration for her perspective. Also, using a credit card for a high-value item could be risky if they can't pay it off quickly, leading to debt.\n\nSo, while the guitar purchase is understandable as a dream item, the lack of communication and the dismissive response to the fianc\u00e9e's valid concerns likely make the author at fault. The answer should reflect that the author's actions disregarded the relationship's financial partnership, leading to the conflict.\n"
