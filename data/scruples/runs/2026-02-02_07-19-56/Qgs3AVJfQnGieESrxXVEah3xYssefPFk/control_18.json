My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong when their fianc\u00e9e is upset. The scenario involves a significant purchase made without consulting their partner, using a credit card with a high limit. The fianc\u00e9e is concerned about financial risk, while the buyer argues it's a once-in-a-lifetime investment that can be resold if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility in relationships. It's common for couples to have different views on money management. The fact that the purchase was made on a credit card without prior discussion might be a point of contention. Even if the buyer believes it's a good investment, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that it's a risk to their shared financial future. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual agreement. In many relationships, major purchases, especially those involving debt, are discussed together. The buyer here didn't consult their partner, which could be seen as a breach of trust or financial transparency. Even if the buyer's intentions were good, the lack of consultation is a valid reason for the fianc\u00e9e's anger. \n\nAdditionally, the argument about credit card use is interesting. The buyer sees it as a tool for big purchases, but using a high-limit credit card for a non-essential item might not align with responsible financial planning. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about debt affecting their future makes sense, especially if they have shared financial goals.\n\nThe buyer's insistence on not selling the guitar despite the store's offer might escalate the tension. It shows they are not considering the fianc\u00e9e's financial concerns and are doubling down on their decision. This could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and priorities.\n\nHowever, the buyer has a valid point about their lifelong dream. It's their passion, and the guitar is a significant personal milestone. But the method and timing of the purchase are what matter. If the couple had a financial plan, this purchase might have been planned differently. The lack of discussion is the main issue here.\n\nSo, while the buyer's actions are understandable from their perspective, the way they handled the purchase without consulting their partner is problematic. Financial decisions in a relationship, especially those involving debt, should ideally be mutual. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering their fianc\u00e9e's viewpoint and not discussing the purchase beforehand.\n"
