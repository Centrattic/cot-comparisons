My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to conflict with their fianc\u00e9e who's threatening to leave over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been passionate about guitars since childhood, and this specific Gibson Les Paul is a once-in-a-lifetime find. They used a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't available. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, seeing it as a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar's value will increase and that credit cards are for such purchases. They also mention the store is willing to buy it back, but the fianc\u00e9e is angry about not selling it. The author isn't willing to return it, leading to tension.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. Financial decisions in a relationship often require communication and mutual agreement, especially when using shared finances. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a big deal. Even if the purchase is a personal dream, spending a significant amount on it without discussing could be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial future is valid; using a high-limit credit card for a luxury item might lead to debt. The author's justification about the guitar's value and credit card usage might be their perspective, but it's not addressing the partner's valid concerns. The fact that they don't plan to return it despite the fianc\u00e9e's anger shows a lack of compromise. However, the author isn't asking for advice but whether they're an asshole. \n\nIn similar situations, forums often highlight that while personal passions matter, respecting a partner's financial boundaries is crucial. The author's actions may have disregarded their partner's feelings and financial planning. Even if the purchase is rationalized as an investment, the approach of not discussing it first is problematic. So, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and acted unilaterally, causing significant stress.\n"
