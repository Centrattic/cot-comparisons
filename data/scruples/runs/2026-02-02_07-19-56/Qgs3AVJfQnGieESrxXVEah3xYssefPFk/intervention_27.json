My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation again. The person bought a dream guitar, which is a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, using a credit card with a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author thinks it's a good investment since these guitars always go up in value, and they even offered to sell it back to the store, but the fianc\u00e9e is angry about that too.\n\nFirst, I should consider financial responsibility in a relationship. When couples share finances or are planning to merge them, big purchases without discussion can be a problem. Even if they consider their money as joint, communication is key. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a big no-no in relationships. Trust and mutual decision-making are important here.\n\nThe author used a credit card to buy it because they couldn't get financing elsewhere. Using a credit card for a large purchase, especially one that's $10k, could lead to debt. Even if the guitar appreciates, the interest on the credit card could outweigh the investment gains. Plus, the fianc\u00e9e might not see it as an investment but as a luxury item that's risky.\n\nThe author's argument is that credit cards are for things you can't afford upfront. However, using a credit card for a significant purchase without considering the long-term financial impact isn't responsible. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial future is valid because high-interest debt can cause major issues. The author dismissing her concerns as being about \"silly\" things shows a lack of empathy and understanding.\n\nThe part where the author mentions the store is willing to buy it back might not reassure the fianc\u00e9e if the timing isn't right. Also, refusing to sell it now could mean the couple is stuck with the debt if they can't afford it. The author's refusal to consider selling it despite the fianc\u00e9e's anger adds to the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, especially when planning to get married, major financial decisions should be made together. The author's actions could be seen as selfish, not considering the partner's feelings or the shared financial goals. Even if the author believes it's their dream, the way it was handled without discussion is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's main mistake was not communicating with the fianc\u00e9e about the purchase. Financial decisions of this magnitude affect both partners, and the author's disregard for their partner's input and financial concerns makes them at fault here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
