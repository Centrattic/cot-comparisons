My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong, especially since their fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave them over it.\n\nFirst, the person in question bought a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a classic guitar. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feels it's a financial risk. The person argues that the guitar is a dream item and that it's an investment since these guitars appreciate in value. They also mention that the store offers a buyback, but they won't sell it. The fianc\u00e9e is concerned about using a credit card for such a purchase.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibility in a relationship. Even if the guitar is a dream item, using a high-limit credit card without discussing it with a partner could be an issue. Financial decisions, especially big ones, usually require communication and agreement between partners. The person in question didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a red flag in terms of partnership. \n\nThe argument that it's an investment might not hold in terms of relationship dynamics. While some investments appreciate, others don't, and the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about risk. Even if the person believes it's a safe investment, the fact that they took on debt without discussing it is a problem. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about feeling that her partner isn't considering their shared financial future.\n\nThe person's stance that the credit card is for \"once in a lifetime\" things is their own perspective, but in a relationship, shared finances or discussions about large purchases are typically expected. The refusal to sell the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's objections shows a lack of compromise. \n\nSo, while the person might not be \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, in terms of relationship responsibility, they likely acted unilaterally. The key issue here is communication and mutual agreement on financial decisions. Therefore, the person is in the wrong for not discussing such a significant purchase with their partner.\n"
