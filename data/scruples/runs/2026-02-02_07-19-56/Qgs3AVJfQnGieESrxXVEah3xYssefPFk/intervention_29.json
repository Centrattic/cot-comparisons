My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the author has a long history of playing guitar since age 8, so the desire for the Gibson Les Paul makes sense. They found a rare, exact model they wanted and bought it with a credit card that had a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar appreciates in value and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nI need to consider financial responsibility in a relationship. Even if the author believes the guitar is a good investment, using a shared credit card without discussing it with their partner can be seen as a breach of trust. Financial decisions, especially big ones, typically require mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial future is valid. The author's dismissal of her worries as disagreement might be dismissive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the store is willing to buy it back, but the fianc\u00e9e is upset they won't sell. This shows a lack of compromise. The author's stance that they won't back down might escalate the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, communication and respect for each other's perspectives are key. The author's action, while fulfilling a personal dream, ignored the partner's financial concerns. So, even if the guitar is a dream item, the way it was handled could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
