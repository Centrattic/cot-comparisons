My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is about buying a dream guitar with a credit card without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the person has been playing guitar since they were 8, so it's a long-time passion. The guitar they bought is a rare and valuable item, a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which they saw as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10k limit they've had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset they didn't consult her, feeling it's a financial risk. She's also mad that they won't sell it back, even though the store is offering to buy it. The person argues that credit cards are for such purchases and that the guitar has value.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Financial decisions in relationships often require communication. Even if it's a personal dream, using shared finances without discussion can be seen as a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9e feels her concerns about financial security are valid. The author's argument about the guitar's value and credit card use might be reasonable, but the lack of communication is a key point here. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not discussing the purchase? Probably. Relationships often expect partners to consult each other on large expenses, especially when using shared resources or credit that affects both. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave shows how serious she takes this. The author might not be the sole wrongdoer, but they did make a decision that impacted their partner without discussion. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the lack of communication, even if the purchase itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
