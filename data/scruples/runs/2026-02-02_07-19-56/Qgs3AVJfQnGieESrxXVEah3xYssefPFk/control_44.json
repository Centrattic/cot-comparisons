My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author bought a dream guitar with a credit card that had a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is a one-time opportunity, it's an investment since it appreciates, and that credit cards are for buying things you can't afford upfront.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Financial decisions in a relationship often require communication and agreement. The author bought a significant item without discussing it with his fianc\u00e9e, which is a common point of contention. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that this puts their financial future at risk, which is a valid concern. The author's defense is that the guitar is an investment that appreciates and that using credit is acceptable for such purchases.\n\nI should think about whether the author's actions were reasonable. Using a credit card for a large purchase can lead to debt, especially if the couple can't pay it off quickly. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about financial responsibility and shared decision-making. Even if the guitar is an investment, the immediate financial impact on the couple matters. The fact that the author took this action without discussing it shows a lack of consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's concerns.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the store is willing to buy it back, but he's not selling it. That might indicate he's not concerned about the financial aspect, but the fianc\u00e9e is worried about the debt. The argument about credit card usage is a difference in financial philosophy. The author's stance might be seen as irresponsible from the fianc\u00e9e's viewpoint.\n\nIn relationships, shared financial responsibilities are important. The author's decision to make a large purchase without consulting his fianc\u00e9e could be seen as a breach of trust or partnership. Even if the purchase itself is justified, the method of financing and the lack of communication are problematic. So while the author might not be a complete \"asshole,\" his actions were inconsiderate and possibly in the wrong because he didn't involve his partner in the decision. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
