My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that they bought their dream guitar, a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which they've wanted since they were a kid. They used a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't available. Now their fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks they're risking their financial future, and they're arguing about whether the guitar is a good investment or a waste of money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and they see the guitar as an investment since it's supposed to increase in value. They also think credit cards are meant for such purchases. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is concerned about financial responsibility and the couple's shared money. She's upset that the author didn't consult her first, which is a big deal in relationships. \n\nFinancial decisions, especially big ones, usually require communication and agreement between partners. Even if the author sees the guitar as a sound investment, the fact that they made a significant purchase without involving their fianc\u00e9e could be seen as dismissive of her input and their shared financial goals. Using a credit card for a $10k purchase is a major financial move, and not discussing it with a partner can lead to tension. \n\nThe author might argue that it's their dream and the guitar's value will go up, but the fianc\u00e9e's point is about trust and shared responsibility. The key issue here isn't just whether the purchase was wise, but the lack of communication. In relationships, big purchases that impact shared finances should be discussed. The author's actions might have been impulsive without considering their partner's perspective. \n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were good, the way they handled the purchase could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and considering their partner's viewpoint.\n"
