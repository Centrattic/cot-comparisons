My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person bought a dream guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, using a credit card with a high limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about the financial risk and the lack of communication.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is financial decision-making in a relationship. When two people are in a committed relationship, especially engaged, it's generally expected that major purchases affecting shared finances be discussed. The author argues that the guitar is a \"once in a lifetime\" opportunity and that it's an investment since these guitars appreciate. However, the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a risk and that the author didn't consider their shared financial future.\n\nThe author used a credit card with a $10,000 limit, which is a significant amount. Using credit for a luxury item, even if it's a dream purchase, can be seen as irresponsible if it puts the couple's finances in jeopardy. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about the financial risk is valid because credit card debt can lead to high interest rates, and relying on resale value isn't guaranteed, despite the author's belief that the guitar will always appreciate. While some assets do appreciate, market conditions can change, and there's no certainty in the future.\n\nAnother point is communication. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a big deal in a relationship. Even if they have separate finances, major purchases that impact shared financial stability should be discussed. The author's response to the fianc\u00e9e's concerns by offering to sell the guitar back to the store, then refusing to do so, might have escalated the conflict. It shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and priorities.\n\nThe author's justification that credit cards are for \"once in a lifetime\" purchases is a personal opinion. While credit cards can be used for planned expenses, using them for high-value items without a plan to pay off the debt could be risky. The fianc\u00e9e's stance that this isn't an appropriate use of credit cards is also reasonable, indicating a difference in financial values.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author made a significant financial decision without involving their partner, which could be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is a valid expression of her priorities and financial security. The author's insistence on not selling the guitar despite knowing it upsets her shows a lack of compromise. \n\nSo, while the author might not be malicious, their actions disregarded the fianc\u00e9e's financial concerns and the importance of communication in a relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
