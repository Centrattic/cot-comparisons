My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to their fianc\u00e9e threatening to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been saving for a 1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a significant purchase. They used a credit card with a $10k limit, which they've had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, that the guitar appreciates in value, and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, using a credit card for a large, non-essential item can be risky, especially if it's maxing out the limit. Credit cards often have high interest rates, so if the author can't pay it off quickly, that's a problem. However, if they plan to pay it off immediately or within a grace period, maybe that's okay. But the post doesn't mention repayment plans.\n\nIn a relationship, major financial decisions should be discussed. Even if the author sees the guitar as a dream come true, not consulting their fianc\u00e9e could be a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9e feels her concerns about their shared financial future are valid. The argument that the guitar is a safe investment might not hold if the market fluctuates, though the author is confident in its value.\n\nThe author's refusal to sell the guitar despite the store offering to buy it back shows commitment but might not address the fianc\u00e9e's financial stress. The use of the credit card as a tool for \"once-in-a-lifetime\" purchases is a personal belief, but financial advisors usually recommend using credit cards for planned, manageable expenses, not impulsive large buys.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't consider their partner's perspective and took a financial risk without discussion. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about shared responsibility and future security. The author's actions, while understandable for a personal dream, might have been selfish in the context of the relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely A (in the wrong), but there's nuance. The key points are communication and financial responsibility in a relationship.\n"
