My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, the context: the author has been playing guitar since 8, it's a big part of their life, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime purchase. They used a credit card with a high limit, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her. She's worried about financial risk, even though the author thinks the guitar is an investment that appreciates.\n\nSo, the key points here are about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author's defense is that the guitar is a dream item, and they see credit cards as tools for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels that the purchase jeopardizes their shared financial future and that the author didn't involve her in the decision.\n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement, especially when using shared resources or credit that affects both parties. Even if the author is using their own credit card, the fianc\u00e9 might consider it part of their joint finances if they have a shared financial plan or if the debt could impact their future together (like buying a house, starting a family, etc.). The author didn't consult her, which is a big deal because major purchases can have long-term implications.\n\nThe author's argument that the guitar is an investment is a common one, but it's speculative. While some vintage guitars do appreciate, it's not guaranteed, and relying on that as a financial strategy is risky. Also, the fianc\u00e9's point about using credit cards for such a purchase is valid because high-interest debt can be burdensome if the investment doesn't pan out.\n\nCommunication is a two-way street. Even if the author saw it as their personal dream, in a committed relationship, significant financial decisions should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9's anger stems from feeling excluded and possibly worried about the financial stability of their future. The author's dismissive attitude (not seeing the fianc\u00e9's perspective) and insistence on not selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9's concerns might be seen as selfish.\n\nHowever, the author isn't wrong in feeling passionate about their dream. But the way the purchase was handled\u2014without consultation and using credit\u2014might be where the issue lies. The key here is the lack of communication and considering the other person's financial priorities. So, while the author might not be in the wrong in terms of their passion, they did act in a way that disregarded their partner's concerns, which is a problem in a relationship.\n"
