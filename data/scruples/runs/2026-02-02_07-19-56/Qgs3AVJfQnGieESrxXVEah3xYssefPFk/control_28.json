My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who's upset because the author bought a dream guitar using a credit card, leading to potential financial strain and relationship issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility. The author used a credit card with a $10,000 limit, which might be a significant expense. Even though they mention that these guitars always go up in value, there's an assumption there that might not hold if the market changes. Plus, using a credit card can lead to debt and interest charges if not managed properly. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about financial future, which is a valid point because unexpected expenses can arise, and having high credit card debt could be risky.\n\nNext, communication and shared financial planning. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which is a big deal in a relationship. Even if the author believes the purchase is justified, not discussing it with their partner shows a lack of consideration for their perspective. Financial decisions, especially big ones, usually require mutual agreement to maintain trust and teamwork in a relationship.\n\nThe author's defense is that credit cards are for buying things you can't afford upfront. While credit cards can be tools for building credit or managing cash flow, using them for large, non-essential purchases without a plan to pay off the balance quickly can lead to debt. The fianc\u00e9's argument that this is not a responsible use of credit is worth considering.\n\nThe fact that the author mentions the store is willing to buy it back but refuses to sell it complicates things. It shows a possible lack of flexibility in the situation, which might be frustrating for the fianc\u00e9 who wants a solution. The author's stance that they're not selling it reinforces the idea that the purchase was impulsive and not thought through from a financial partnership standpoint.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, financial disagreements can be a major source of conflict. The author's refusal to see the fianc\u00e9's concerns and the insistence on being right might indicate a lack of empathy. The fianc\u00e9's threat to leave is extreme, but it's a reaction to feeling that her partner isn't prioritizing their shared financial stability.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author made a decision that was important to them but did so without considering their partner's input and financial implications. While buying a dream item isn't inherently wrong, the method and communication around it are problematic. The author might not be entirely at fault, but their actions did disregard their partner's concerns, which is a valid reason for the fianc\u00e9's reaction. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't discuss the purchase and took on debt without considering their partner's perspective, leading to financial and emotional strain in the relationship.\n"
