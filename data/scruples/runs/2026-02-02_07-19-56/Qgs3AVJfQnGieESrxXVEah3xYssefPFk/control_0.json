My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who bought the dream guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e is in the wrong. The scenario has elements of personal finance, relationship dynamics, and differing perspectives on spending.\n\nFirst, the person has been wanting this guitar since childhood, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a high limit, which they've had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels their financial future is at risk. The author argues that the guitar is an investment since it's a vintage item that appreciates, and they won't sell it. The fianc\u00e9e feels the spending was reckless and that they should have discussed it.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication, financial responsibility, and differing values. The author bought something very important to them but didn't involve their partner in the decision. Even if the author believes it's a wise investment, the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a risk. In relationships, big purchases that affect shared finances usually require mutual agreement. The fact that the author didn't consult their partner is a red flag. Using a credit card for a high-value item might be seen as impulsive. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about financial security and shared responsibility. The author's stance is about personal passion versus financial planning. \n\nIn many relationships, major purchases, especially those involving debt, are discussed together. Not doing so can be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns. Even if the author's intentions were good, the lack of communication is a significant issue. The fianc\u00e9e's anger might not just be about the guitar but about the principle of making joint financial decisions. The answer might hinge on whether the purchase was a shared responsibility or considered a personal expense. If the money was shared, then the author's unilateral decision is problematic. Even if the money is separate, using credit that affects their joint financial situation could be an issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the relationship's norms. If they have an open agreement on finances, then maybe not. But typically, big purchases that impact both partners should be discussed. The author didn't consider their partner's perspective, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and made a decision that affects their partner's financial security.\n"
