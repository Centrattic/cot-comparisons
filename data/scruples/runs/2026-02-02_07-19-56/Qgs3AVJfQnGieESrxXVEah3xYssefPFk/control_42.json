My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought a dream guitar using a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult each other about the purchase and considers it a financial risk. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has had a long-standing dream of owning this specific guitar. They found a rare opportunity and took it, using a credit card. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a risk and that the author didn't involve them in the decision. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a big part here. Using a credit card to buy a high-value item might not be the best idea, especially if it's not an emergency. The argument about whether credit cards are for such purchases is a point of contention. The author thinks it's for \"once in a lifetime\" things, but the fianc\u00e9 disagrees.\n\nAnother angle is communication in relationships. Even if the author sees their money as shared, making a large purchase without consulting their partner can be seen as disrespectful. The fianc\u00e9's primary concern is about financial security and shared decision-making. The author's response about reselling the guitar back to the store, which backfired, shows a lack of consideration for the fianc\u00e9's feelings.\n\nThe value of the guitar increasing isn't a solid guarantee, though the author believes in it. Market fluctuations can affect collectibles. The emotional aspect of the argument is that the author is standing their ground, not willing to compromise, which might exacerbate the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. Even if the purchase is a personal dream, the method of acquisition without discussion can be seen as selfish. The fianc\u00e9's threat to leave is a strong reaction, indicating the severity of the issue in their eyes.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting their partner and taking on debt without discussing the financial implications. The key issue here is the lack of communication, not just the purchase itself. Even if the purchase is justified as a dream, the way it was handled could be problematic in a relationship context.\n"
