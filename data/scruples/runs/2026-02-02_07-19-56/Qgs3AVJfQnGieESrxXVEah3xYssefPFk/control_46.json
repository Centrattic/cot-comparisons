My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether buying the dream guitar was a mistake, especially since the fianc\u00e9e is upset and considering leaving over it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've been playing guitar since they were 8 and have always wanted a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul. They found one that's exactly what they wanted and had to buy it because it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit, which they've had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that these guitars always increase in value and that credit cards are for such purchases. The store is even willing to buy it back, but the author isn't interested in selling. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about the credit card use and the potential financial risk.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author didn't consult their partner about a big purchase, which is a common point of conflict in relationships. The use of a credit card for a high-value item could be seen as risky, especially if they can't pay it off immediately without interest. Even if the guitar might appreciate, the timing and communication around such a purchase are important. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is valid because sudden large expenses without discussion can strain finances and trust. The author's stance that it's not a risk because the guitar will increase in value might not address the immediate financial impact on their joint finances. The fact that the store offers a buyback doesn't necessarily mitigate the financial burden if the author can't pay it off right away.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if they believe in their financial capability to handle the credit card debt and the value of the guitar. However, the main issue is the lack of communication and considering the partner's feelings. In relationships, even if one person sees something as justified, the other's feelings are important. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests that the purchase was a significant breach of trust, possibly leading to bigger issues. The author's refusal to acknowledge the fianc\u00e9e's perspective could indicate a lack of empathy, which can be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's passion for music and fulfilling a lifelong dream is understandable. But financial decisions, especially large ones, usually require mutual agreement in a partnership. The fact that the author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e first is a key factor here. Whether or not the purchase is a mistake, the approach taken could be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the purchase with their fianc\u00e9e and potentially risking their relationship. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the main issue is the lack of communication and not respecting the partner's financial concerns, even if the purchase itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
