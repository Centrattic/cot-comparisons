My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person bought their dream guitar, a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, using a credit card with a $10,000 limit. Their fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult them and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, that such guitars always increase in value, and that credit cards are meant for big purchases.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their fianc\u00e9e, which is a common point of contention in relationships. Even if the author sees it as a good investment, the fact that the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a risk and that they didn't talk about it is a problem. \n\nFinancial decisions, especially big ones, are usually considered joint responsibilities in a relationship. Using a credit card for a $10,000 purchase without consulting the other person can be seen as not respecting their input. The author mentions that the store is willing to buy it back, but that doesn't address the underlying issue of not involving their partner in the decision. \n\nAlso, arguing that credit cards are for such purchases might be a point of contention. While credit cards can be used for large purchases, accumulating significant debt without considering the partner's views might not be considered responsible. \n\nThe author's stance that they aren't selling the guitar and that the fianc\u00e9e should accept their decision could be seen as dismissive of her concerns. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the lack of communication and consideration for the other person's financial perspective can be seen as the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's financial concerns.\n"
