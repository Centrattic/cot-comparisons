My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person bought a dream guitar using a credit card with a high limit because they couldn't get financing. They didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, who is now upset and threatening to leave. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've had the credit card since college, which suggests they might be used to managing it. However, using the entire limit on a single purchase, especially for a high-value item, could be risky. Even if the guitar is expected to appreciate, the immediate financial impact is significant. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about the financial future being at risk is valid because credit card debt typically has high interest, which could strain their finances if there's a financial emergency or other expenses.\n\nCommunication is another aspect. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a big part of relationship dynamics. Even if they have joint finances, major purchases usually require discussion. The fianc\u00e9e's frustration stems from not being involved in the decision. The author's argument that \"our money is our money\" might be true in a way, but in a committed relationship, financial decisions should ideally be made together.\n\nThe author's defense that credit cards are for buying unaffordable items is a viewpoint, but it's not the only perspective. Many financial advisors caution against using credit for non-essential items, especially when it maxes out a credit line. The fianc\u00e9e's disagreement here is a sign of differing financial values, which can lead to conflict if not addressed.\n\nThe fact that the author considered reselling the guitar but refused to do so because it's a dream item shows a lack of flexibility. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that the author isn't considering her concerns seriously. The threat to leave is a severe consequence, but relationships often require compromise. The author's refusal to budge on selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's distress could be seen as self-centered.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's nuance. The author's passion for the guitar is understandable, but the manner in which they handled the purchase and the aftermath is where the issue lies. The decision to buy without discussing it with their partner and then doubling down when confronted could be viewed as inconsiderate. However, the author's perspective is also about pursuing a lifelong dream, which is a personal value.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be entirely wrong, but there's a significant element of not respecting their partner's financial concerns and communication needs. The answer hinges on balancing personal desires with partnership responsibilities.\n"
