My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e. The situation is that the author used a credit card with a $10,000 limit to get a vintage Gibson Les Paul, which they considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about the financial risk and not discussing it beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they've been playing since they were 8, so this is a significant passion. The guitar is a dream item and they believe it's a good investment since these guitars appreciate in value. They used a credit card because financing wasn't an option, and they think credit cards are for buying things you can't afford upfront. The fianc\u00e9e, however, feels the financial risk is too high and that the author didn't consider their shared finances.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on several factors. Communication is a big one. Even if the author sees the guitar as a wise investment, not discussing such a large purchase with their fianc\u00e9e could be a mistake. Financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement, especially when using shared resources or credit cards. The author might argue it's their personal money, but if the credit card debt affects both, especially if they're planning to marry, that's a shared responsibility.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about financial security and not being consulted. The author's response that credit cards are for such purchases might not consider the fianc\u00e9e's financial priorities. Even if the guitar appreciates, there's a risk involved because no investment is guaranteed, and relying on selling it back might not be safe. The author's refusal to sell it now shows commitment to the purchase, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's passion for music and the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity could be seen as valid. However, the financial implications and the lack of communication are on their side. The question is whether the author's actions were selfish or if they had a valid reason. \n\nIn relationships, financial decisions often require teamwork. Even if the author believes they're right, not involving the partner in such a significant expense can be seen as dismissive of their concerns. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave shows how serious the issue is for her. The author might not be in the wrong entirely if they had their own money and the purchase was a personal investment, but the way it was handled\u2014without discussion and using credit\u2014might have been the mistake.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate and took a financial risk that affects both partners. However, there's nuance, and some might side with B (not in the wrong) if they value personal passion and investments. But given the relationship context, A seems more likely.\n"
