My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has been playing guitar since they were 8, which is a long time. The guitar they bought is a rare, pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a significant and expensive item. They used a credit card with a $10k limit after financing wasn't an option. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that it's an investment since it appreciates in value. They also mention that the store is willing to buy it back, but they won't sell. The fianc\u00e9e is angry about using the credit card for this purchase, but the author thinks credit cards are meant for such things.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, communication in the relationship, and differing priorities. The author's defense is that the guitar is a personal dream and a sound investment, but the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a risk and a lack of consideration. \n\nFinancially, using a credit card for a large purchase, especially one that's a significant portion of the limit, can be risky. High-interest rates on credit cards can lead to debt, which might affect their financial future. The author mentions the guitar's value increasing, but that's not guaranteed. Collectibles can have fluctuating values, and relying on that as an investment is speculative. \n\nCommunication is another issue. Even if finances are shared, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is valid. Not consulting each other on major purchases can lead to conflict. The author might see it as their personal dream, but in a partnership, major financial decisions should involve both parties. The fianc\u00e9e's frustration comes from feeling excluded and possibly worried about their shared future.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're not in the wrong, but from a relationship standpoint, not discussing the purchase could be seen as dismissive of their partner's concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's emotional response is about feeling that her partner isn't respecting their joint financial planning. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's more about differing values. The author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in wanting to fulfill their dream, but they might have missed considering their partner's financial priorities. The fianc\u00e9e isn't wrong either in feeling it's a risk. So, the author's fault lies in not communicating and possibly underestimating the financial implications. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the main issue is the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's concerns, even if the purchase itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
