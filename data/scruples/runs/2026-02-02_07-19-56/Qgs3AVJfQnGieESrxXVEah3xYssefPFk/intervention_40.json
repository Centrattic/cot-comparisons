My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought a dream guitar with a credit card is in the wrong, especially since their fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave over it. \n\nFirst, the person has been playing guitar since age 8, so it's a long-term passion. The guitar is a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which sounds like a valuable and rare item. They used a credit card with a $10k limit they've had since college. The key points here are the financial decision-making and communication issues.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her. In relationships, especially when it comes to shared finances, communication is crucial. Even if they consider their money as joint, making such a large purchase without discussing it can be seen as dismissive of her feelings and financial priorities. \n\nThe author argues that the guitar is a sound investment since they can resell it, but the store being willing to buy it back might not guarantee the same financial gain. Using a credit card for a large purchase can lead to debt, which could strain their finances. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial risk is valid here.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that credit cards are for such purchases. However, this approach might not align with the fianc\u00e9e's financial values. The disagreement seems to be about financial priorities and how to handle major purchases.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's viewpoints and making joint decisions about significant expenses is important. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the lack of consultation and the financial implications could justify the fianc\u00e9e's anger. The author might have been inconsiderate of her feelings and the potential financial impact on their future together.\n\nSo, while the guitar is a personal dream, the way it was purchased without discussing it with the partner could be seen as the author's mistake. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
