My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 22, engaged to be married, and has been playing guitar since around 8 years old. They bought a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a dream guitar for many musicians. The purchase was made with a credit card that has a $10,000 limit, which they had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feels the financial risk is too high. She also doesn't agree with using credit cards for big purchases that might not be necessary, and she's mad about the author not selling the guitar back even when a store is willing to buy it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's the case. Let's consider the key points here. Financial decisions in a relationship, especially when it's a significant purchase, can be a touchy subject. The author's argument is that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that it's an investment since these guitars appreciate in value. They also mention that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that using the credit card for a high-value item puts their financial future at risk and that the author didn't consult her, which is important in a committed relationship.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, in relationships, it's generally considered important to communicate and make major financial decisions together. Even if the author believes the purchase is a good investment, using a credit card for a $10k item is a significant financial move. The fact that the credit card has a high limit might make it easier for the author, but the fianc\u00e9e's concern is valid because the debt could affect their shared financial stability. The argument about the guitar's value is on the author's side, but the method of financing and the lack of consultation are points where the author might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be about feeling excluded from major decisions. Even if the author isn't in the wrong in a strict sense, the way the purchase was made without discussing it with their partner could lead to relationship issues. The author's stance that they won't sell the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's wishes might add to the tension. It's a balance between personal dreams and shared responsibilities.\n\nIn some cases, having a dream purchase is understandable, but when it's financed with debt and affects the partner's financial security, it's a point of contention. The author might not be malicious, but their actions disregarded their partner's financial concerns. So, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong because they made a significant financial decision without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, leading to conflict and potential financial strain.\n"
