My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, which led to their fianc\u00e9e threatening to leave them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The author has been wanting this specific guitar since childhood. They found a rare opportunity and used a credit card with a $10k limit to purchase it. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because the author didn't consult her and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime investment and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is also upset that the author won't sell it back, even though the store offers a buyback.\n\nNow, thinking about financial responsibility in relationships. Even if the author sees the guitar as a smart investment, using a credit card for a large purchase without discussing it with a partner can be problematic. The author mentions \"our money is our money,\" implying a joint account or shared finances. If they're sharing financial responsibilities, big purchases should be mutual decisions. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is about the financial future, which is valid. Even if the guitar appreciates, the debt from the credit card purchase could affect their joint financial stability. \n\nAlso, the author's argument that credit cards are for things you can't afford on the spot might not hold. Credit cards are tools, but they come with interest and should ideally be used responsibly. If the author can't pay off the balance immediately, they're incurring debt, which is a risk. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that the purchase was impulsive and not discussed, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. \n\nThe author's refusal to compromise by not selling the guitar despite the store's buyback offer might escalate the conflict. The fianc\u00e9e might feel unheard if the author isn't willing to meet in the middle. \n\nSo, while the author's passion for the guitar is understandable, the lack of communication and considering shared financial responsibilities could make them at fault. The key issue here is the failure to discuss a major financial decision with a partner, which is a breach of trust and cooperation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
