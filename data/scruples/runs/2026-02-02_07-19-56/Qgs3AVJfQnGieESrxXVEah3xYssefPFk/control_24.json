My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar that caused conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul, a significant purchase. They used a credit card with a $10k limit, which they had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he didn't consult her and is worried about financial risk. The author argues that the guitar's value increases and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nI need to consider financial responsibility and communication in relationships. Even if the guitar is a dream item, using a credit card for a high-value item can be risky, especially if it's a shared financial situation. The key points are: not discussing the purchase beforehand, using credit, and the fianc\u00e9e's perspective on financial planning.\n\nThe author might believe personal dreams are important, but in a relationship, shared financial decisions are crucial. The fianc\u00e9e's anger stems from feeling excluded and financial concerns. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they should have discussed it first, regardless of the item's value or investment potential.\n\nSo, the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because not consulting a partner on a major expense, especially using credit, can be seen as irresponsible financially, even if the purchase is a personal dream.\n"
