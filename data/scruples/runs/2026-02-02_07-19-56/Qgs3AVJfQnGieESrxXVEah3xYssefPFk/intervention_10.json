My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to a fight with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the author bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul, which is a significant purchase. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar appreciates and that credit cards are for big purchases. But the fianc\u00e9e wants to sell it back, which the author refuses.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Even if the purchase isn't inherently a financial mistake, the main issue here is communication. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their partner, which caused conflict. In a committed relationship, especially with a significant other, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The fact that the author made this decision unilaterally is problematic. \n\nFinancial responsibility is subjective. The author might believe it's a wise investment, but the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about shared financial responsibility. Using a credit card for a high-value item can lead to debt, especially if the market doesn't hold up as expected. Even if the guitar does appreciate, the immediate financial strain could be an issue if they can't pay off the credit card quickly. \n\nThe author's refusal to consider selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's concerns shows a lack of compromise. Relationships often require balancing personal desires with the other person's feelings and financial priorities. The fianc\u00e9e's anger stems from feeling disregarded and the potential risk to their shared future. \n\nSo, while the author might not see their actions as wrong, the key issue is the lack of communication and consideration for their partner's viewpoint. In relationships, how you handle shared financial matters is crucial. The author's actions, though perhaps understandable from their perspective, disregarded their partner's input, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not involving their fianc\u00e9e in the decision.\n"
