My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person bought a dream guitar they had wanted for a long time, but their fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and used a credit card with a high limit. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The guitar was a significant purchase, and using a credit card with a $10,000 limit might be a problem, especially if they were using it for big purchases before. If the couple has joint finances or if there's an unspoken agreement to discuss major purchases, then not consulting her could be an issue. The fianc\u00e9e feels that this purchase put their financial future at risk, which is a valid concern if they have other obligations or if the debt from the credit card isn't manageable. \n\nThen there's the emotional side. The author sees this as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and values his dream. He might not see it as a risk because he believes the guitar's value will increase. But the fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about the financial risk and the fact that he made a big decision without her input. The fact that he mentions the store is willing to buy it back and then refuses to sell it shows he's not willing to compromise, which might be adding to the tension.\n\nMarriage and engaged couples often discuss major purchases. If the author didn't consult his fianc\u00e9e, especially for a large purchase that affects their shared finances, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if he thinks it's a good investment, the lack of communication is a problem. The fianc\u00e9e's anger isn't just about the guitar but about the decision-making process and financial responsibility in their relationship.\n\nSo, while the author's passion for the guitar is understandable, the key issue is whether the purchase was made irresponsibly without considering their shared financial situation and communication. If they have joint finances or if they've discussed financial decisions before, then not involving her is a mistake. The answer hinges on the expectation of consultation in a committed relationship regarding significant expenses.\n"
