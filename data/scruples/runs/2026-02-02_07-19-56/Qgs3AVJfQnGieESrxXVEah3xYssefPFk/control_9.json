My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author has a long-standing passion for guitar, found a rare and expensive instrument, bought it on a credit card without consulting their partner. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about the financial risk and lack of communication. The author believes it's a sound investment since the guitar's value increases, and credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e disagrees, leading to tension.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibility in relationships. When partners are engaged or married, financial decisions often require mutual agreement, especially significant purchases. The author didn't consult their partner, which is a common point of contention. Even if the guitar is a personal dream, the credit card debt affects both their combined finances. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about the financial future is valid because carrying high-interest debt can be risky. The author's argument that the guitar always goes up in value is speculative; while collectibles can appreciate, there's no guarantee, and relying on that for a justification might be risky. \n\nThe use of a credit card for a large purchase without considering the partner's input is another issue. Credit cards can lead to debt that strains relationships if not managed together. The author's stance that credit cards are for such purchases might be true in theory, but in practice, using them for non-essential items without discussing with a partner can cause problems. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about feeling excluded from major financial decisions and fearing the impact on their future. The author's refusal to sell the guitar despite the partner's anger might escalate the conflict. The core issue here is communication and shared financial planning. Even if the author sees it as their personal dream, the financial implications are shared, so their decision to act unilaterally is problematic. \n\nSo, while the author's passion is understandable, the lack of discussion and consideration for the partner's concerns makes them at fault. The answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because financial decisions affecting both should be mutual.\n"
