My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author bought a dream guitar for $10k using a credit card without consulting their fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she thinks it's a financial risk and they should have discussed it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's perspective is that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and they believe the guitar is an investment that will increase in value. They also mention that credit cards are for such purchases. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels that major financial decisions should be made together, especially when using shared credit, and that the purchase puts their financial future at risk.\n\nFinancial responsibility in relationships often involves communication and mutual agreement, especially when making large purchases that affect shared finances. The fact that the author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e is a key point here. Even if the guitar is a personal dream, using a credit card with a high limit without discussing it might be seen as not considering the partner's perspective.\n\nAnother angle is whether the purchase was a risk. The author claims the guitar will appreciate, but investments aren't guaranteed, and relying on that assumption could be risky. Additionally, using a credit card for such a large purchase might lead to debt, which can strain a relationship if not managed together.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reaction is valid because unexpected large expenses can cause financial stress. The author's refusal to consider selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's objections might escalate the conflict. The fact that the store is willing to buy it back but the author won't sell it shows a lack of flexibility in addressing the partner's concerns.\n\nIn relationships, respect and communication are crucial. The author's decision to act unilaterally on a significant expense could be seen as dismissive of the partner's feelings. Even if the author believes they're right, the way it was handled might have been inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the purchase with their fianc\u00e9e first, especially since it's a major financial decision that impacts both of them. The argument about credit cards and investments doesn't negate the importance of mutual financial planning in a relationship.\n"
