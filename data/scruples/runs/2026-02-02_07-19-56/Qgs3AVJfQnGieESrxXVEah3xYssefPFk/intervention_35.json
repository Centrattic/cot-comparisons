My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, leading to a potential argument.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've had a credit card since college with a $10,000 limit and used it to buy the guitar. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss it, and she's worried about the financial risk. The author thinks the guitar is a good investment since these instruments hold value, and they even mention the store is willing to buy it back. However, the fianc\u00e9e is mad because they're using a credit card for a luxury item and that they won't sell it back.\n\nNow, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is communication. The author didn't consult their partner before making a significant purchase, especially one that uses a credit card. Even if the author sees it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, not discussing it with their fianc\u00e9e could be a problem. Financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement, especially when using shared resources or when it might affect their financial future. The author's defense is that credit cards are for such purchases, but using a credit card for a high-value item like a vintage guitar might be seen as risky, especially if it leads to debt. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial responsibility versus the author's passion for their dream guitar creates a conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the value of communication in relationships. Even if the author's actions don't seem malicious, the lack of communication can cause hurt. The fianc\u00e9e feels her concerns about their financial future are being disregarded. The author's refusal to consider selling the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's objections adds to the tension. \n\nSo, while the author might have a valid passion and perspective, the key issue is the unilateral decision without considering the partner's feelings and financial priorities. In relationships, major purchases that affect both partners' finances typically require discussion. The author's actions, though driven by personal desire, might have been negligent in terms of communication and mutual decision-making. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their intentions and disregarded their partner's concerns about financial responsibility.\n"
