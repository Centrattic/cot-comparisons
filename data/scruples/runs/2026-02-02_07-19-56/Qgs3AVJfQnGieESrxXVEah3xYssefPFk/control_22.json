My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe author is 22 and has been playing guitar since they were 8. Their dream was to own a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul. They found one that was exactly what they wanted and bought it with a credit card they had since college. The card has a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, arguing that it's their money and it's a risk. The author counters by saying the guitar appreciates in value and credit cards are meant for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is also upset that the author won't sell it back to the store and that they used the credit card. The author isn't considering selling the guitar and is asking if they were wrong to buy it.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility is a big part here. Using a credit card for a $10,000 purchase might be risky if they can't pay it off quickly. High-interest rates could lead to debt. The author assumes the guitar will go up in value, but that's an investment risk. Collectibles can be volatile, even if they're classic models. The fianc\u00e9e is concerned about financial security, which is understandable in a relationship.\n\nCommunication is another key factor. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a major point of contention. Even if it's their shared money, big purchases should be discussed. The fianc\u00e9e feels her input was ignored, leading to her anger. The author's stance that it's their money might not consider shared financial responsibilities in a committed relationship.\n\nThe argument about credit card use: credit cards are for emergencies or necessary expenses, not luxury items, especially when it can lead to debt. The author's reasoning that credit cards are for things you can't afford on the spot is part of their defense, but this is a significant purchase. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about financial planning and mutual decisions. The author's refusal to sell the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's anger shows a lack of compromise. The mention that the store will buy it back could have been a way to alleviate her concerns, but instead, the author doubled down by refusing to sell, which probably escalated the conflict.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's financial boundaries and priorities is important. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe it's their money and a personal dream. However, the lack of communication and the potential financial risk could make them at fault. The fianc\u00e9e's valid concerns about the financial future and the impulsive purchase without discussion might mean the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author's dream is significant, but the financial implications and communication breakdown are on their side. The answer hinges on whether respecting the partner's financial input is more important than fulfilling a personal dream. Given that the author didn't consult their partner, which is a common expectation in relationships, especially for major purchases, they might be in the wrong. So, Answer A.\n"
