My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong, especially since their fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave over it. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been playing guitar since they were 8, so this is a big deal for them. They found a rare, pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a classic and valuable instrument. They bought it with a credit card, using a 10k limit they had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels financial risks are being taken. The author argues that the guitar is a sound investment since these guitars appreciate in value, and they used the credit card appropriately. However, the fianc\u00e9e is worried about the financial future and the fact that they won't sell it back if needed.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and financial responsibility. The author didn't consult their partner, which is a common relationship issue. Money decisions, especially large ones, often require mutual agreement. Even if the author believes it's a good investment, the partner's feelings about shared finances and risk are important. The use of a credit card for a high-value item might be seen as risky, depending on their financial situation. If they can't pay it off quickly, that's a problem. Also, the partner's concern about the financial future is valid because debt can affect both people in a relationship, even if they don't have joint accounts.\n\nThe author's argument that they're not at fault is based on their personal dream and the investment angle. But in relationships, respecting each other's perspectives and discussing major purchases is crucial. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e feels her concerns are dismissed might contribute to the conflict. The author might not be entirely wrong, but they did act without considering the partner's input, which is a significant issue in shared relationships. So, while the purchase itself isn't necessarily unethical, the lack of communication and considering the partner's financial concerns makes them at least partially responsible.\n"
