My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong, especially since their fianc\u00e9e is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the person has been playing guitar since they were 8, which is a long time. The guitar they bought is a rare, high-end model from before 1960, which they considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit they had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels it risks their financial future. The author argues that the guitar is a sound investment since such guitars always increase in value and that credit cards are for big purchases. However, the fianc\u00e9e is against it and even the offer to resell it back to the store is making her angrier.\n\nNow, considering financial planning in a relationship, communication is key. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their partner, which is a common point of conflict. Using a credit card for a high-value item that can't be easily liquidated might be risky, especially if there's a chance the couple can't pay it off quickly, leading to debt. Even if the guitar is an investment, the couple's financial stability is a shared responsibility. The author's insistence that the fianc\u00e9e is wrong about credit card use and the refusal to sell the guitar despite her objections shows a lack of compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's passion for the guitar is understandable, and having a dream item that one has worked towards for years is valid. However, the main issue here is the lack of consideration for their partner's concerns. Financial decisions, especially large ones, should involve both partners to maintain trust and avoid resentment. The author's actions might have been impulsive and not considerate of their fianc\u00e9e's perspective, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, while the author's actions stem from a personal dream, the way they handled the purchase and the subsequent disregard for their partner's feelings might make them at fault. The key here is the communication and shared financial planning aspects. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
