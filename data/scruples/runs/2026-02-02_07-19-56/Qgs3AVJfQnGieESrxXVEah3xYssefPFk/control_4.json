My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, which caused their fianc\u00e9e to threaten to leave because of financial concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been playing guitar since 8, which is 14 years now. They found a rare Gibson Les Paul from before 1960, exactly what they wanted. They used a credit card with a 10k limit because financing wasn't available. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels the financial future is at risk. The author argues that the guitar appreciates in value and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is angry about not being involved and the author not wanting to sell it back.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Using a credit card for a big purchase without consulting their partner. 2) The financial implications and whether it was a risk. 3) The differing views on what credit cards are for and financial responsibility.\n\nIn a relationship, especially with a partner, shared financial responsibilities often require communication and agreement. The author might feel it's their dream, but the fianc\u00e9e's concern is about the financial risk. Even if the guitar's value is stable, using credit can lead to debt, and without discussing it, it might have been a breach of trust. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe it's a fair use of their money, but relationships often require compromise. The key issue is whether the purchase was made without considering the partner's input, which can be a mistake even if the individual action isn't inherently wrong. So, the answer might hinge on whether the lack of communication was the main issue.\n"
