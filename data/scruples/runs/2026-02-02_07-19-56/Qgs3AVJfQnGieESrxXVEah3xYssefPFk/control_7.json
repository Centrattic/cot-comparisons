My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong when their fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave them over it. The person bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul, which is a significant expense. They used a credit card with a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is a dream item, always increases in value, and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a lifelong dream. The fianc\u00e9e's side is about financial responsibility and communication. Financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement, especially when using shared resources or credit that affects the couple's financial health.\n\nThe author didn't consult their partner, which is a big red flag in relationships. Even if the guitar is a dream item, major purchases should involve discussion. The fianc\u00e9e is concerned about the financial risk, and while the author thinks the guitar will appreciate, there's no guarantee, and using credit might lead to debt. The argument about credit cards being for such purchases is a bit shaky; credit cards are tools, but using them for large, non-essential items without a plan to repay can be risky, especially if it's a significant portion of the limit.\n\nThe author is not asking for advice on the relationship but whether they were an asshole. From a relationship standpoint, financial decisions require communication. The author's stance of not considering their partner's perspective is problematic. Even if the purchase itself is justifiable, the lack of consultation is a key issue. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is understandable because it's about shared financial future. \n\nSo, the author did something that caused significant stress and conflict in the relationship without considering their partner's feelings and financial concerns. That makes them at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
