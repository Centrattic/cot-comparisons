My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is 22, has been playing guitar since 8. They bought a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a dream guitar for them. They used a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't an option. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels it's a financial risk. The person argues that the guitar appreciates in value and credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is also upset that they won't sell it back and used a credit card. The person isn't looking for relationship advice but wants to know if they were an a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility. Using a credit card with a high limit for a $10k purchase is significant. Even if the guitar may appreciate, there's a chance of financial strain if there's debt involved. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that they should be considering their financial future together, like buying a house or dealing with emergencies. The person didn't consult their partner, which is a big red flag in relationships. Communication is key in shared finances, even if they aren't technically in a joint account. The argument about credit cards being for one-time purchases is debatable. Responsible use of credit is about repayment and not overextending. \n\nThe person's defense is that it's a dream they've had since childhood, but the fianc\u00e9e might feel that their priorities aren't aligned. The fact that the person won't budge and the fianc\u00e9e is considering leaving shows a serious conflict. The person might not see the financial risk, but the fianc\u00e9e does. The decision to buy something so expensive without discussion could be seen as selfish, especially in a committed relationship where financial decisions impact both partners.\n\nOn the other hand, the person's passion for music is valid, and the guitar might hold emotional value. But the way the purchase was made, without considering the partner's input, could be the main issue. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about mutual respect and shared decision-making. So, the person might not be entirely wrong, but their approach definitely caused harm. The question is whether their action was wrong. Since financial decisions in a relationship typically require communication, the person might be at fault for not involving their partner. So, answer A.\n"
