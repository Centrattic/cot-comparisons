My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar that caused a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been a guitarist since 8, so the dream is long-standing. They found a rare Gibson Les Paul, which they considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10k limit, which they had from college. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk.\n\nThe author argues that the guitar appreciates in value and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9 is against it, even suggesting selling it back, which the author refuses. The key points here are communication, financial planning, and differing values.\n\nIn relationships, big purchases that affect shared finances usually require discussion. Even if the author sees it as a wise investment, using a credit card for a $10k item might be risky, especially if there's no emergency fund. The fact that the author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9 is a red flag. Financial decisions should ideally be made together, especially when it's a significant portion of their resources. The fianc\u00e9's concern about financial stability versus the author's passion for the guitar creates a conflict of priorities.\n\nWhether the author is at fault depends on cultural or personal beliefs, but generally, not discussing such a large expense with a partner is inconsiderate. The author might not be \"wrong\" in pursuing their dream, but they failed to consider their partner's perspective and financial partnership. So maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and potential financial risk without mutual agreement.\n"
