My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who bought a dream guitar using a credit card without consulting their fianc\u00e9e is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 22, has been playing guitar since 8, and this is a significant dream item. They found a rare pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul and bought it on a credit card with a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't discuss it, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar appreciates in value and uses the credit card for necessary purchases.\n\nNow, the main issues here are financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author didn't consult their partner, which is a common point of contention in relationships. Even if the author sees the purchase as justified, the lack of communication might be the bigger issue. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's perspective is also valid. Using a credit card for a high-value item might be risky if they can't pay it off immediately. However, the author mentions that the guitar is an investment. But investments carry risks, and maybe the couple wasn't on the same page about financial decisions. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. Some might view buying a dream item as acceptable, especially if it's a passion, but others might see it as irresponsible if it causes strain. The fact that the author is unwilling to sell it despite the fianc\u00e9e's objections shows a lack of compromise.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. The author might not be entirely wrong in pursuing their passion, but neglecting to communicate with their partner is a mistake. Relationships require mutual consideration, and financial decisions are a big part of that. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, while intense, is a valid concern about shared finances and future planning.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their financial decision with their partner, which is a key aspect of relationship management. Even if the purchase itself isn't wrong, the lack of discussion is a significant oversight.\n"
