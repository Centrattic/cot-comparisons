My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar with a credit card, leading their fianc\u00e9 to threaten to leave them.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a 22-year-old who's been playing guitar since they were 8. Their dream was a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which they found and bought with a $10,000 credit card. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult each other about the purchase, and they're arguing about financial responsibility. The author thinks it's a good investment since the guitar's value increases, while the fianc\u00e9 is worried about the financial risk.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Use of shared finances without consultation. 2) High credit card debt for an expensive hobby. 3) The fianc\u00e9's perspective vs. the author's.\n\nFrom the author's side, they see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and an investment. They believe credit cards are for such purchases. But the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a risk and wants joint financial decisions. The author's argument is that the guitar is a dream item and a safe investment, but the fianc\u00e9 disagrees.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Financial decisions in relationships often require communication. Even if the author sees it as their money, in a committed relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9, major purchases can affect both partners. Using a credit card with a high limit for a $10k item might not be the best idea if it causes stress. The author didn't consult their partner, which is a big issue. The fianc\u00e9's anger stems from a lack of communication and potential financial strain.\n\nThe author's response to the fianc\u00e9's concerns\u2014like offering to sell the guitar back\u2014might have been a mistake because it shows a lack of consideration for the partner's feelings. Also, the argument that credit cards are for such purchases is a bit simplistic. Credit cards can lead to debt if not managed properly, which can impact financial health.\n\nIn relationships, respect and communication are key. The author might have acted on a personal dream without considering the partner's financial priorities. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the way it's handled\u2014without discussion\u2014can lead to conflict. The fianc\u00e9's threat to leave is extreme, but the author's actions might have contributed to the tension.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing the purchase with their fianc\u00e9. The financial implications of using a high-limit credit card for such an expensive item without joint decision-making could be seen as irresponsible. The author's dismissal of the fianc\u00e9's concerns and the way they handled the situation (like the offer to sell back) didn't help either. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
