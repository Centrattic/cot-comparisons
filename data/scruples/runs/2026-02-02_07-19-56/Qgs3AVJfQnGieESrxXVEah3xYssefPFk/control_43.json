My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar, which caused a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul, which is a significant purchase. They used a credit card with a high limit because they couldn't get financing. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar's value will increase and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nI should consider financial responsibility in relationships. Typically, when two people are engaged, especially planning a future together, major purchases might require discussion. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is about shared financial responsibility. The author's argument is that the guitar is an investment and a lifelong dream. However, the method of payment (credit card) adds interest risk unless paid off immediately. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Did the author consult the fianc\u00e9e? No, which is a red flag in shared finances. 2) Is the purchase a financial risk? Using credit cards for large purchases can lead to debt, especially if not paid off. 3) The author is unwilling to sell, which might cause long-term strain.\n\nEven if the guitar is valuable, the decision-making process matters. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about trust and shared financial planning. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate and took on debt that affects their joint future. So, the answer is likely A (Yes).\n"
