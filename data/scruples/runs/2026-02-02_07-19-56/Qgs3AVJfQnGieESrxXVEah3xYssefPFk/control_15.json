My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who bought the dream guitar is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 threatening to leave over the purchase. \n\nFirst, the author has been wanting this specific guitar for a long time\u2014a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul. They bought it on a credit card with a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the author didn't consult them, leading to financial strain. The author argues that the guitar is a one-time opportunity, it's an investment since it's a classic guitar, and credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nNow, considering financial responsibility in relationships. Even if it's a dream item, using a credit card for a large purchase without discussing it with a partner can be problematic. The fianc\u00e9 feels it's a risk to their future. The author mentions the store will buy it back, but the fianc\u00e9 wants them to sell it, which the author refuses. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is key in shared finances. If they're in a committed relationship, especially engaged, major purchases should be discussed. The author's actions might come off as dismissive of the fianc\u00e9's concerns. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is valid because sudden large debt without consultation can cause financial stress. The author's justification about the guitar's value might not matter if it's causing relationship issues. \n\nSo, even if the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime item, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's financial perspective is a misstep. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
