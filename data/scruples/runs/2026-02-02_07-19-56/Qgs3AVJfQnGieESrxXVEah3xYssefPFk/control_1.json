My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe person is 22, has been playing guitar since age 8, and their dream was to own a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul. They found a perfect one and bought it on a credit card with a $10k limit because financing wasn't an option. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, putting their financial future at risk. The person argues that the guitar is a sound investment since these guitars appreciate in value and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is upset about not being consulted and the financial risk.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Financial decisions in relationships often require communication and mutual agreement, especially when using shared or joint accounts. The fianc\u00e9e feels that her input was disregarded, which is a common point of conflict. The author's defense is that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and a good investment. However, using a credit card for a high-value item can be risky if there's a chance of not paying it off, which could lead to debt. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial stability might be valid, especially if they have future plans like buying a house or starting a family.\n\nThe key points here are communication and financial responsibility. The author didn't consult their partner, which can be seen as dismissive of the partner's financial concerns. Even if the item is a good investment, the lack of communication can damage trust. The argument that credit cards are for such purchases might not hold if it leads to debt that's hard to manage. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's passion for the guitar is genuine, and the item might indeed appreciate. But in relationships, both partners' perspectives need to be considered. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction isn't just about the money but about being excluded from a major financial decision. So, while the author might not be \"wrong\" in a moral sense, they did fail to consider their partner's viewpoint, which is a relationship issue. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions were a breach of trust or neglect of communication. Since the fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave, this indicates a significant breakdown in communication. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing such a large purchase with their partner, regardless of the item's value or their intent.\n"
