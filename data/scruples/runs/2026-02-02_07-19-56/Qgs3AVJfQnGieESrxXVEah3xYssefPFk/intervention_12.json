My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought a dream guitar using a credit card, and their fianc\u00e9 is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been playing guitar since they were 8, so it's a big passion. They found a rare and specific guitar they wanted. They used a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about financial risk and not consulting each other.\n\nIn relationships, financial decisions are often a point of contention. Even though the author might see it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a risk and that they should have discussed it. The author's argument is that credit cards are for such purchases and the guitar's value will increase. But the fianc\u00e9 disagrees and is upset that the author won't sell it back.\n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't consult their partner. Even if the purchase seems justified to them, in a relationship, big financial decisions usually require discussion. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because they're concerned about the shared financial future. The author might not have done anything illegal, but they ignored their partner's feelings and potential financial planning. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they acted without considering their partner's input. However, it's also a personal passion. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
