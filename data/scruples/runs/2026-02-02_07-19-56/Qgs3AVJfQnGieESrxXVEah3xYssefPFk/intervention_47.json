My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. The author's main points are that the guitar was a lifelong dream, they used a credit card with a high limit, and they believe it's a good investment since the value increases. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feel it's a financial risk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. Using a credit card for a large purchase, especially one that's not a necessity, can be risky. High-interest rates could lead to debt, affecting their future. Even if the guitar appreciates, the immediate financial strain and potential credit score impact are real concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about financial security, which is a valid point.\n\nThen there's the relationship angle. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which could be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting her input. In a relationship, major financial decisions often require discussion, especially when shared finances are involved. The author's insistence on keeping the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9e's objections might escalate the conflict.\n\nThe author argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that it's an investment. However, investments usually require careful planning and risk assessment. Relying on resale value from the same store might not account for market fluctuations or other financial downturns. The fianc\u00e9e's fear of financial instability is understandable, especially if they have future plans like buying a house or starting a family.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's passion for music and fulfilling a lifelong dream is valid. But balancing personal desires with shared responsibilities in a relationship is crucial. The fact that the author is defensive and unwilling to compromise might indicate a lack of empathy towards the fianc\u00e9e's perspective.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a significant purchase without discussing it, potentially risking their financial future, and dismissing their partner's concerns. While the dream aspect is understandable, the lack of communication and disregard for financial planning seems to tip the scales. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
