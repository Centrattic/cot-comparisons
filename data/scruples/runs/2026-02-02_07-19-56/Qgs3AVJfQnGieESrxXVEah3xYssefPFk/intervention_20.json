My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 being upset about the purchase, and the person defending their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility. The person used a credit card with a $10k limit, which they've had since college. They argue that credit cards are for things you can't afford upfront, but using a significant portion of the credit limit for a luxury item might be risky. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about their financial future, which is a valid point. Even if the guitar appreciates in value, the debt could affect their combined finances. The person didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which is a key factor in relationships. Trust and communication are important, so not discussing a major purchase might contribute to the conflict.\n\nThe person mentions reselling the guitar, but then refuses to do so, which could be seen as doubling down on the decision. The fianc\u00e9 feels that the purchase was impulsive and risky. The argument about whether it's a financial risk versus a dream purchase is subjective. Some might see it as a justified expense for a lifelong dream, while others see it as irresponsible.\n\nFinancial independence vs. shared responsibilities in a relationship. If they are in a position where their money is separate, maybe the purchase was okay. But if they are planning to merge finances or have joint responsibilities, the decision to take on debt without consultation might be problematic.\n\nThe key points are: using a credit card for a significant purchase without discussing it, the fianc\u00e9's valid concerns about financial security, and the lack of communication. The person might not be in the wrong if they believe in their financial management, but the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also valid. The answer depends on whether the purchase was a shared decision or not. Since they didn't consult, it's a breach of communication. But the person's view is that it's their money and their dream. So maybe a balanced answer, but since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is understandable, so the answer is A.\n"
