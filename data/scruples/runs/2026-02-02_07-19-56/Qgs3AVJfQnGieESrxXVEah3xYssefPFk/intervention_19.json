My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author bought their dream Gibson Les Paul, which they've wanted since they were a kid. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and used a credit card with a high limit. The author argues that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that the guitar appreciates in value, so it's a good investment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue seems to be financial decision-making without consulting a partner. The author used a credit card with a $10k limit, which might be a joint account or at least a shared financial responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e feels that this puts their future at risk. The author's defense is that credit cards are for such purchases and that the guitar is a sound investment.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships, financial decisions usually require communication and mutual agreement. Even if the money is separate, using a large credit card for a significant purchase without discussing it with a partner can be seen as dismissive of their concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's anger might stem from feeling that her partner isn't considering their shared future, especially if they have other financial goals or responsibilities.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"once-in-a-lifetime\" opportunities. The author believes they can't pass this up, but the fianc\u00e9e might see it as an unnecessary risk. The argument about the guitar's value increasing is a bit of a gamble; while some items do appreciate, there's no guarantee, and market fluctuations can affect that. The author's insistence that the store is willing to buy it back might not be a solid financial safety net, as reselling might not fetch the same price or at all.\n\nAlso, the author's response to the fianc\u00e9e's concerns\u2014refusing to sell and doubling down\u2014could be seen as not valuing her feelings. Even if the author isn't planning to sell, bringing up the option might have been a way to reassure the fianc\u00e9e, but instead, it made things worse. The author's use of the credit card for a large purchase without prior agreement could be a breach of trust, especially if there were unspoken financial boundaries.\n\nIn many relationships, major purchases, especially those that use credit, are discussed together. The fact that the author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e shows a lack of consideration for her perspective. Even if the author believes they're right, the method of decision-making is problematic. It's not just about the money but about communication and respect in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not consulting their partner and for using a significant amount of credit without discussing financial risks. However, it's a nuanced situation. The author's passion for the guitar is valid, but the execution\u2014without communication\u2014hurts the relationship. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
