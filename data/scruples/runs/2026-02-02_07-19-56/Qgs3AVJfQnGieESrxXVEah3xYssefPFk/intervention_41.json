My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who bought a $10k guitar is in the wrong, especially since their fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave them.\n\nFirst, the person in question bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul that's been a dream of theirs since childhood. They used a credit card with a $10k limit, didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, and now she's upset about the financial risk.\n\nHmm, financial decisions in relationships often involve communication. The author argues that it's their money and that the guitar is a guaranteed investment. But the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a risk and that they didn't consider their future together. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about fulfilling a lifelong dream and seeing the guitar as an asset. The fianc\u00e9e's point is about shared financial responsibility and the potential strain from such a purchase. \n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual agreement. Even if it's their money, in a committed relationship, major purchases usually require discussion. The author didn't consult their partner, which is a point against them. Also, using a credit card for a $10k item might lead to interest charges, making it a financial risk, which the fianc\u00e9e is rightfully concerned about. \n\nThe author mentions the guitar can be resold, but the fianc\u00e9e is upset that they won't sell it. That shows a lack of compromise. The argument over credit card use is another point of contention. \n\nSo, while the author might see it as a justified expense, the lack of communication and considering their partner's perspective likely makes them at least partially at fault. The fianc\u00e9e has valid concerns about shared finances and long-term planning. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate a major financial decision and disregarded their partner's concerns, which is important in a relationship.\n"
