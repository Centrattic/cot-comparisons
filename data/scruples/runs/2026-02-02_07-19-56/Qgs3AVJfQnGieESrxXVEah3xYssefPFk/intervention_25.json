My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying his dream guitar without consulting his fianc\u00e9e, leading to her threatening to leave. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author has had a lifelong dream of owning a specific guitar. He found a rare one and bought it with a credit card to secure the purchase. He believes it's a good investment since these guitars appreciate in value. He also mentions that the store offers to buy it back, which he uses to justify not selling.\n\nOn the other hand, his fianc\u00e9e is upset because he didn't consult her. They might have shared finances, and she feels that using a high-limit credit card for a single purchase puts their financial future at risk. She sees it as a reckless decision, and the fact that he won't sell it now adds to her frustration. The author dismisses her concerns by saying credit cards are for such opportunities, but she disagrees.\n\nNow, the key points here are about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. Even if the guitar is a dream item, using a significant portion of a credit card without discussing it with a partner can be seen as irresponsible, especially if they share financial responsibilities. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about feeling disrespected and not being involved in a major financial decision. The argument here is about mutual respect and financial planning, not just the value of the guitar.\n\nThe author might not see it as a risk because he believes in the guitar's value, but from her perspective, it's a financial risk and a lack of communication. The fact that he used a credit card adds to the issue because it's a debt that needs to be repaid, which could affect their shared finances. \n\nIn relationships, financial decisions often require discussion, especially when they involve substantial amounts of money that can impact both partners. The author's stance that it's his dream and that the guitar's value justifies the purchase might not take into account his fianc\u00e9e's financial priorities and the importance of teamwork in a relationship. \n\nSo, while the author might feel justified in his actions, the lack of communication and considering his partner's feelings could be seen as where he went wrong. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong.\n"
