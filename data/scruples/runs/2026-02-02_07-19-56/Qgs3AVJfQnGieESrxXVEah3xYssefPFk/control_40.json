My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is upset because he bought a dream guitar with a credit card, and she's threatening to leave over it. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The person has been wanting this guitar since he was a kid, and he saw a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. He used a credit card with a high limit because financing wasn't possible. He argues that credit cards are for such purchases and that the guitar's value will go up. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because he didn't consult her. They might be sharing finances, so she feels he put their future at risk. She's also upset that he won't sell it back, even though the store offers to buy it. \n\nThe key points here are communication and financial responsibility. The person didn't talk to his fianc\u00e9 before making the purchase, which is a big deal in a relationship. Even if the guitar is a dream item, using a credit card for a high-value item without discussing it with a partner could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nHe mentions that credit cards are for things you can't afford on the spot, but that's a bit of a stretch. Credit cards are meant for convenience and building credit, not necessarily for large purchases that could lead to debt. Plus, if it's a 10k limit card, using a significant portion of it without considering the couple's finances together is a problem.\n\nFinancial decisions, especially big ones, should be discussed in a relationship. The fact that he didn't consult her, even if it's his dream, might be the main issue here. She feels that her input and the couple's financial security matter. \n\nSo, even though the guitar might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the way he handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer likely leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication and potential financial risk to both of them.\n"
