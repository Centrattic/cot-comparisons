My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. The author's fianc\u00e9e is threatening to leave because they made the purchase without consulting her, using a credit card with a high limit. The author argues that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that the guitar is a good investment since it's a vintage item that goes up in value. They also mention that credit cards are meant for such purchases, and the store is willing to buy it back.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication, financial responsibility, and shared decision-making in a relationship. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which she clearly sees as a major issue. Even if the author's intention was to fulfill a lifelong dream, not involving her in such a significant financial decision could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is about the financial risk, especially using a credit card for a high-value item. The author's response about credit cards being for such purchases might not hold up if they can't afford the payments, leading to debt. The argument that the guitar will appreciate in value is speculative and not guaranteed, though the author is confident. \n\nThe fact that the author mentions the store is willing to buy it back but then refuses to sell it back to the store might indicate that the fianc\u00e9e feels ignored, which could escalate tensions. The author is in denial about the potential financial risk, thinking it's not a risk because of the guitar's value, but that's an assumption. Also, using a credit card with a high limit for a big purchase without discussing it with a partner is a common point of contention in relationships. \n\nFinancial decisions, especially big ones, usually require mutual agreement, especially in a committed relationship like a fianc\u00e9e. Even if the author believes it's their money, shared finances often mean shared responsibility. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, though strong, is a valid concern because sudden large expenses can affect the couple's financial stability. The author's refusal to acknowledge the risk or consider their partner's perspective might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while driven by a personal dream, failed to communicate and consider their partner's financial concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's threat to leave is extreme, but the author's lack of consultation and disregard for the financial implications could indeed be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't include their partner in a major financial decision, leading to conflict.\n"
