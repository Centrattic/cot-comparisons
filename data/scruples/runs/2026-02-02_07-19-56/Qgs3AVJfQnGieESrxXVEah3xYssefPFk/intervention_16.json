My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is 22 and has been playing guitar since age 8. Their dream was to own a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul. They found one that's exactly what they wanted and bought it with a credit card that had a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feels the purchase is a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar will increase in value and that credit cards are for such purchases. The fianc\u00e9e is angry about the credit card use and the fact that the author won't sell it back through the store.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and the value of the item. \n\nFinancially, using a credit card for a high-value item, especially when the total credit limit is $10,000, could be risky. If the card has a $10k limit, spending a significant portion of that on a single item might lead to debt, even if the author believes the guitar will appreciate. However, the author might argue that it's a long-term investment. But the fianc\u00e9e's concern is about the financial future, which is valid. Relationships require mutual agreement on financial decisions, especially big purchases that affect both partners. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e, which is a common point of conflict in relationships. Even if the author thinks it's their money, shared finances often imply shared decisions. \n\nThe author's justification that credit cards are for such purchases isn't entirely wrong, but using a large chunk of the credit limit for a non-essential item might not be prudent, especially if it causes strain in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's anger stems from feeling that her concerns are ignored, which is a relationship issue beyond just the purchase itself.\n\nSo, while the author might not be \"wrong\" in terms of personal desires and investments, the lack of communication and consideration for the fianc\u00e9e's financial perspective likely makes them at fault here. The key is that big purchases should be discussed in a partnership, especially when finances are shared or intertwined. The author acted unilaterally, which caused conflict. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
