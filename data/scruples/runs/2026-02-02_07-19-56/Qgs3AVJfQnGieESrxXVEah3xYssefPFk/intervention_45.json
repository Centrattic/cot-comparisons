My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar was in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's upset because the guitar was purchased using a credit card, potentially risking their financial future. The person argues that it's a dream item that appreciates in value and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider financial responsibility in relationships. Even if it's a personal dream, using a significant amount of credit without consulting a partner can be seen as irresponsible, especially if it affects shared finances. The fianc\u00e9's perspective is that this purchase puts their future at risk, which is a valid concern. The argument that the guitar always goes up in value might not hold if the market fluctuates, so relying on that as a financial safety net isn't wise. Also, the fact that the person didn't consult their partner is a big point here. Communication is key in relationships, and making a large purchase without discussion can be perceived as dismissive of the partner's concerns. The response about credit cards being for such purchases is a bit flimsy; credit cards are tools, but using them for non-essential luxury items can lead to debt issues. The person's insistence on keeping the guitar despite the fianc\u00e9's anger shows a lack of willingness to compromise, which could strain the relationship further. So, while the guitar was a personal dream, the way it was handled without considering the partner's financial concerns makes the person at fault. They might not be entirely wrong in wanting the guitar, but the method and communication around the purchase are the main issues here.\n"
