My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying a dream guitar with a credit card without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a long-standing dream of owning a specific guitar, bought it with a credit card due to financing issues, and now their fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her. She's worried about financial risks, while the author thinks it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that the guitar's value will increase.\n\nSo, the main issues here are financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their fianc\u00e9e, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. The fianc\u00e9e feels her input was ignored, which could be valid. On the other hand, the author sees it as their personal dream and uses the credit card as a tool for such purchases.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author acted inconsiderately. Even if it's a dream item, major purchases that affect shared finances should involve the partner. The author's stance that \"our money is our money\" might not consider the partner's perspective. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial future is reasonable, especially if they rely on each other for financial decisions. The author's refusal to sell the guitar despite the store offering to buy it back could exacerbate the situation, as it shows they're not willing to compromise.\n\nThe author argues credit cards are for such purchases, but using a credit card for a large, non-essential item can lead to debt, which affects both partners if they're in a committed relationship. The fact that the author didn't check with their fianc\u00e9e first is a missed opportunity for mutual decision-making.\n\nSo, while the author's passion for the guitar is understandable, the lack of communication and consideration for the partner's financial concerns is a problem. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they acted unilaterally on a significant financial decision that impacts their partner.\n"
