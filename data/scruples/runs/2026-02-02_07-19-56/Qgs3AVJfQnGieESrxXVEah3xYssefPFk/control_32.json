My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to conflict with their fianc\u00e9e. \n\nFirst, the author has been playing guitar since age 8, so it's a significant part of their life. The guitar is a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a classic and valuable instrument. They found one that's exactly what they wanted and bought it with a credit card that has a $10,000 limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and is threatening to leave over it.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that credit cards are meant for such purchases. They argue that the guitar will increase in value and isn't a risk. However, the fianc\u00e9e feels that this spending jeopardizes their financial future and that the author should have discussed it first.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. Financial decisions in a relationship, especially when it comes to shared money, often require communication and mutual agreement. The author used a credit card that they had since college, which might be a joint or shared financial resource, but the post doesn't specify if the credit card is in both their names or if the finances are separate. If they're sharing finances, then big purchases without discussion can be a problem because it affects their combined budget and future planning.\n\nThe author mentions the guitar's value increasing, which could be true, but the fianc\u00e9e is likely concerned about the debt. Using a credit card for a high-value item can lead to high interest charges if not paid off promptly. Even if the author plans to pay it off, the timing or unexpected expenses from such a large purchase might impact their ability to manage other shared financial obligations. \n\nAlso, the author's refusal to sell the guitar back and their dismissive attitude towards the fianc\u00e9e's concerns might be seen as not respecting her feelings. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about the lack of communication and perceived financial irresponsibility. The author might not be wrong in pursuing a dream, but the method\u2014without discussing it with their partner\u2014could be the issue. \n\nIn many relationships, major purchases are a joint decision. The author's argument that it's \"our money\" is valid if they're sharing finances, but using a credit card could indicate debt that affects both. The fianc\u00e9e's anger seems to stem from feeling that her partner didn't consider their financial goals or her opinions. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate the purchase, which is a significant financial decision, especially in a committed relationship. Even if the guitar is a dream item, the lack of discussion and the way they responded to the fianc\u00e9e's concerns could be seen as dismissive and inconsiderate.\n"
