My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The scenario is that they bought a dream guitar without consulting their fianc\u00e9e, using a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, thinking it's a financial risk and they should have discussed it first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether it's reasonable to buy such an expensive item without discussing it with a partner. The fianc\u00e9e is part of a long-term relationship, so financial decisions might be seen as joint. Even if they don't share finances, big purchases can affect the relationship. The author argues that credit cards are for buying things you can't afford, but using a large credit limit for a $10k guitar is a significant expense. \n\nThe author mentions the guitar's value always increases, but that's an assumption. Collectibles can be risky, and not all investments hold up. The fianc\u00e9e is worried about financial future, which is valid. Also, the author didn't consider consulting her, which might be a breach of communication in a serious relationship. Even if they have different views on credit use, the act of not discussing such a big purchase could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the guitar is a lifelong dream, and the opportunity was once-in-a-lifetime. The author felt it was necessary to act quickly. But in a relationship, especially when planning to marry, major financial decisions should be mutual. The author's stance that they're not wrong because they're not selling the guitar might not address the fianc\u00e9e's concerns about financial responsibility.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the purchase was a personal dream, but the method of financing and lack of communication with the partner could be where the author went wrong. Therefore, the answer is more likely A (yes, in the wrong) because of not discussing and using credit irresponsibly, but there's also understanding for the dream aspect. But the main issue is financial decision-making without consultation in a committed relationship.\n"
