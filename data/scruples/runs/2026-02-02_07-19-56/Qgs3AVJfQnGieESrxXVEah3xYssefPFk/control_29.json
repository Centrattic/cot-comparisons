My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is between them and their fianc\u00e9e. The main points are about buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to a conflict over finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a long history with the guitar, it's a dream item, and they saw it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card they had for a while, and they believe credit cards are for such purchases. They also argue that the guitar's value increases, so it's a good investment.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, which implies a lack of communication. She feels their financial future is at risk, which is a valid concern. The author's response that they can sell it back doesn't help because they refuse to sell, showing they're not considering her perspective. Also, using a credit card for a large purchase can be risky if they can't pay it off quickly, especially if interest rates are high.\n\nFinancial decisions in relationships often require mutual agreement. Even if it's a dream item, big purchases should be discussed. The author's stance that they're not in the wrong might come from their passion for the guitar, but the fianc\u00e9e's concern is about shared finances and planning. The key here is whether the purchase was irresponsible. The author didn't consider the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and financial planning, which could strain the relationship. However, the guitar's potential value increase is a point in their favor, but that's speculative.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't consult their partner, used a credit card for a significant expense without considering the implications, and dismissed their partner's concerns. While their passion is understandable, the financial aspect and communication are crucial. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to weigh the arguments again. The fianc\u00e9e's valid financial concerns versus the personal fulfillment of the author. In relationships, shared financial decisions matter, so not consulting is a misstep. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
