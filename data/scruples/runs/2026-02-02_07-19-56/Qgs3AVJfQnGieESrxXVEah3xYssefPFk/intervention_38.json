My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is that the author bought their dream guitar, a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, using a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar is an investment and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nHmm. So the main points are financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their partner, which is a big deal. Even if the guitar is a dream item, using a credit card for a high-value purchase without considering the partner's input could be seen as inconsiderate. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about financial future is valid because credit card debt can be risky, even if the author believes the guitar's value will increase. The fact that the author won't sell it back further tensions the situation because it shows they are not willing to compromise. \n\nOn the other hand, the guitar is a significant personal dream and might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But relationships require communication and mutual financial decisions. Not consulting the partner on such a big expense might have been the wrong move. So the author might be in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings and financial concerns. But I'm a bit torn because the dream aspect is also a personal passion. However, in a committed relationship, major financial decisions should involve both partners. So probably, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
