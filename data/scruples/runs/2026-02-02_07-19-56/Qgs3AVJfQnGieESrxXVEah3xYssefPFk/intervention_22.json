My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by buying their dream guitar, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9. The answer options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been playing guitar since they were 8, and this is a significant purchase for their dream. They bought a vintage Gibson Les Paul, which they saw as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. They used a credit card with a $10k limit and didn't consult their fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the financial risk and the lack of communication.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, using a credit card for a large purchase without discussing it with a partner can be problematic. Even if the author believes the guitar will appreciate in value, the fianc\u00e9 feels it's a risk. Financial decisions, especially big ones, often require mutual agreement, especially in a committed relationship where finances are shared. The author's argument that credit cards are for such opportunities might not hold weight if it strains the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's passion for the guitar and the emotional value of achieving a lifelong dream are valid. The key issue here is communication. The author didn't consult their partner, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. Even if the purchase itself isn't inherently wrong, the lack of discussion and the potential financial strain on the relationship could be seen as the mistake.\n\nSo, the question is whether the wrong lies in the purchase itself or in not discussing it with the fianc\u00e9. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer hinges on the communication aspect rather than the purchase decision alone. Therefore, the author may be in the wrong for not involving their partner in the decision-making process, even if the purchase was personally justified.\n"
