My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who bought the dream guitar is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 being upset because the author bought an expensive guitar without consulting them, using a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9 is threatening to break up over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author has been a long-time guitarist with a dream to own a specific guitar. They found a rare model and bought it with a credit card because financing wasn't available. The fianc\u00e9 is upset about the financial risk and lack of consultation.\n\nIn relationships, financial decisions are often a point of conflict. The author might feel it's their dream and that the guitar is a sound investment since these guitars appreciate. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is concerned about the financial security of the relationship. The author didn't consult them, which is a big issue in shared finances, even if they aren't technically sharing money.\n\nThe use of a credit card for a large purchase could be seen as risky. While credit cards are for purchases, using a significant portion of the limit might lead to debt. The argument that the guitar will increase in value might not hold in the short term, and there's no guarantee. The author's refusal to sell it despite the fianc\u00e9's concerns adds to the conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, not consulting a partner on a major purchase, especially one that uses a credit card, could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author believes it's their money, a fianc\u00e9 might expect discussions about large expenses. The financial impact on the relationship is a valid concern here.\n\nHowever, the author has a valid point about it being a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and a lifelong dream. The value of personal fulfillment versus financial prudence is a tricky balance. But since the fianc\u00e9 is a significant other, especially when engaged, the expectation of mutual financial planning might be higher.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, the author didn't consider their partner's perspective and the financial implications. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. But generally, not involving a partner in such a decision could be seen as a mistake.\n"
