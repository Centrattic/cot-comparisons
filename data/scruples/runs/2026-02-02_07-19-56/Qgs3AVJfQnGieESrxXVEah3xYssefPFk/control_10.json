My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who bought the dream guitar is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 threatening to leave over the purchase.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The person has been playing guitar since age 8, so it's a lifelong passion. The guitar is a pre-60s Gibson Les Paul, which is a classic and valuable instrument. They bought it with a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her, considering their money as shared. The person argues that the guitar is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that these guitars always increase in value. The fianc\u00e9 feels financial risk was taken for a personal dream, and the person's refusal to sell again is making her angrier.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The question is about financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. Even though the guitar is a dream item, using a shared credit card for a big purchase without discussing it with a partner can be seen as a breach of trust, especially if finances are considered joint. The fianc\u00e9 might feel disrespected or not involved in major financial decisions. The argument that it's a good investment might not matter if it causes strain. The person's stance that credit cards are for such purchases is a personal view but might conflict with the partner's financial values.\n\nIn relationships, open communication about money is crucial. The author didn't consult their fianc\u00e9, which is a key point. Whether it's right or wrong depends on societal views on financial independence vs. partnership. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction indicates that this was a significant issue. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in their own eyes, but objectively, not discussing a major purchase could be seen as a mistake. So, answer A (Yes) because they didn't communicate, leading to conflict. But maybe answer B (No) if it's considered their personal right. Hmm. Need to balance both perspectives.\n"
