My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who bought a dream guitar is in the wrong. They're arguing with their fianc\u00e9e about it.\n\nFirst, the guitar is a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, which is a classic and valuable instrument. The person has been playing since they were 8, so this is a big dream for them. They bought it with a credit card that has a $10,000 limit, which is a significant amount. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and feels it's a financial risk. The person counters by saying the guitar appreciates in value and credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nNow, considering the relationship aspect, they mentioned that their money is joint. If they're in a committed relationship, especially one where finances are shared, making a large purchase without discussing it can be seen as dismissive of the other's concerns. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is about financial responsibility and shared decisions. The person might see it as a justified splurge, but the way they handled it could have been better. \n\nAlso, the fact that the person took out a credit card for this purchase adds to the financial strain. Even if the guitar is valuable, using a credit card for such an expensive item could lead to debt issues, which is a valid concern. The fianc\u00e9e's anger stems from feeling that her partner didn't respect her input in financial matters, which is a key part of any serious relationship.\n\nSo, while the person's passion for the guitar is understandable, the decision-making process here might have been flawed. They should have communicated better and considered their partner's viewpoint. Financial decisions, especially big ones, should ideally be discussed together in a committed relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not consulting their fianc\u00e9e and taking on debt without considering her concerns.\n"
