My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who bought the guitar is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is upset because he bought a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul using a credit card with a $10k limit. He didn't consult her, and she feels it's risking their financial future. He argues it's a dream item and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple is engaged, so they're likely in a committed relationship where financial decisions might involve each other. The person used a credit card with a high limit, which could lead to debt. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because he didn't consult her, which is a common issue in relationships where joint financial planning is expected.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and that the guitar appreciates in value. But he's taking on debt, which could affect their future. The fianc\u00e9e's point is about financial prudence and shared responsibility. The fact that he mentions not selling the guitar shows he's firm in his decision, which might make the situation worse as he's not considering her perspective.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, not discussing major purchases that involve significant debt could be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns. Even if he didn't break any rules, the issue is about mutual respect and communication. Using a credit card for a high-value item that's not an emergency might be seen as irresponsible, especially if it's a risk to their shared future.\n\nHowever, the counterargument is that it's a personal dream and he's within his rights to spend his own money. But since they're engaged, financial decisions might be considered joint. The author's stance that the credit card is for such purchases might not align with responsible financial practices, especially if they can't pay it off quickly.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If they have a joint financial plan and he didn't discuss it, then yes, he might be at fault for not communicating. If they have separate finances, maybe less so. But given the fianc\u00e9e's reaction and the context of being engaged, it's likely expected to discuss such a purchase. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her concerns and taking on debt without her input.\n"
