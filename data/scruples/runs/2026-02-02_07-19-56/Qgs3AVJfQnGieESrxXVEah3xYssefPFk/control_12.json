My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying a dream guitar with a credit card, which led to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9e.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has been wanting a vintage Gibson Les Paul for a long time. They bought it with a credit card, which had a $10k limit, and didn't consult their fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels this puts their financial future at risk. The author argues that the guitar's value appreciates and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nNow, thinking about financial responsibility in relationships. Even if the author sees buying the guitar as a one-time, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the fact that they used a credit card with a high limit without discussing it with their partner is a point of contention. Financial decisions, especially big ones, often require mutual agreement in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is about the financial risk and the potential strain on their shared money. The author's defense that the guitar will increase in value might be valid, but that's an investment perspective, which the fianc\u00e9e might not agree with. Also, using credit cards for large purchases can lead to debt, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. The author's refusal to sell the guitar back, even though the store offers to buy it, shows they're committed to keeping it, which might escalate the conflict. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, not discussing a significant financial decision with a partner can be seen as dismissive of their concerns. While the author might believe they're acting on a dream and using the credit card appropriately, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective is valid too. The answer might hinge on the assumption that joint finances require joint decisions. Therefore, the author could be seen as at fault for not consulting their partner first, even if they had good intentions.\n"
