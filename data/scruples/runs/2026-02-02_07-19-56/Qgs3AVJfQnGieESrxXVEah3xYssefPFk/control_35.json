My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 22, has been playing guitar since 8. They bought a pre-1960s Gibson Les Paul, their dream guitar, using a credit card with a $10k limit. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels they put their financial future at risk. The author argues that the guitar is an investment since it always increases in value, and credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is financial decision-making and communication in a relationship. The author made a big purchase without discussing it with their partner. Even though they might consider it a dream or an investment, the fianc\u00e9e feels it's a risk. The use of a credit card adds to the financial strain, especially if they can't pay it off immediately, leading to interest and potential debt.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. From a financial responsibility standpoint, big purchases that affect shared finances should be discussed with a partner. The fianc\u00e9e's concern about the financial future is valid. The argument that the guitar is an investment might not hold if they can't afford the credit card payments, leading to debt. Also, the fact that the author is unwilling to sell it back shows they might not consider the partner's feelings or the financial implications.\n\nBut the author's perspective is that it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and a dream. However, relationships require compromise and communication. Not discussing such a significant expense could be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns. So, while the author's passion for the guitar is understandable, the lack of communication and potential financial risk might make them at fault here. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is about feeling disrespected and the financial risk, which are valid points. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
