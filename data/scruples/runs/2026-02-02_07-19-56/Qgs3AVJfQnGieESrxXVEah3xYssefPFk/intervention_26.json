My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying their dream guitar with a credit card, leading their fianc\u00e9e to threaten leaving them.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been playing guitar since age 8 and found a rare, vintage Gibson Les Paul. They bought it on a credit card with a $10k limit, which they had since college. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because they didn't consult her and they have different views on financial decisions. She thinks it's a risk, while the author believes the guitar's value will increase and that using a credit card is okay for such purchases. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is so angry that she's threatening to leave.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and differing values. Even if the author believes the guitar is a good investment and that they're managing the credit card properly, the main issue is that they didn't discuss such a significant purchase with their partner. In relationships, especially when finances are shared or discussed, making a large purchase without consultation can be seen as disrespectful or neglectful. It's about mutual decision-making. \n\nThe author's argument about the guitar's value and the use of a credit card might be valid in isolation, but the context is a partnership where both parties should agree on major expenses. The fianc\u00e9e's concern is about the financial future and the risk involved, which is a legitimate perspective. The author might not see it as a risk, but the fianc\u00e9e does, leading to conflict. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the author mentions the store is willing to buy it back but refuses to sell it back shows a lack of willingness to compromise, which can escalate the problem. The fianc\u00e9e might feel unheard, which is a bigger issue than just the purchase itself. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate because they didn't communicate their decision, which is crucial in a close relationship. Even if the purchase itself isn't inherently wrong, the way it was handled could be at fault. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of the lack of communication and not respecting their partner's financial concerns.\n"
