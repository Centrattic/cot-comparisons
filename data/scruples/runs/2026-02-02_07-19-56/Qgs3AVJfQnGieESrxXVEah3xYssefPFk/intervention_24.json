My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar, leading to a fight with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been wanting a specific guitar for a long time. They bought it using a credit card with a $10k limit, which they had since college. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her, and she feels it's a financial risk. The author argues that the guitar's value will go up and that credit cards are for such purchases.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility, communication in a relationship, and differing priorities. The author didn't discuss the purchase with their partner, which is a common source of conflict. Even if the author believes the purchase is justified, the lack of communication can be seen as a breach of trust, especially when using shared finances. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's perspective is about protecting their financial future. The author might see the guitar as an investment, but the fianc\u00e9 might view it as an unnecessary expense. The fact that the author is unwilling to sell it despite the fianc\u00e9's objections shows a lack of compromise. \n\nCredit card usage for a large purchase can be risky, especially if there's interest involved. The author mentions financing wasn't possible, so they used the credit card. However, using a credit card for a $10k item might lead to debt, which could strain the relationship further. \n\nIn relationships, financial decisions often require mutual agreement. The author's unilateral action might be seen as dismissive of the partner's concerns. The fianc\u00e9's anger stems from feeling that her priorities aren't being considered. \n\nThe author's justification that the guitar \"always goes up in value\" might not hold if the market fluctuates, and relying on resale isn't a guarantee. The offer to buy back from the store might not cover the credit card debt if there's interest accrued. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while understandable from a personal passion standpoint, may have disregarded the partner's financial security and communication needs. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is valid as she feels her concerns were ignored. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't communicate the purchase, used shared financial resources without consent, and refused to compromise, which are significant issues in a relationship.\n"
