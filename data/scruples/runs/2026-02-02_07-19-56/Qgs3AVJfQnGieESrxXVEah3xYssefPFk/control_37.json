My fiance is threatening to leave me over it.\nI've been playing guitar since I was about 8 years old (I'm 22 now). It's always been my dream to own a pre 1960s Gibson Les Paul. \n\nI just happened to be googling around and found one litterlly exactly like I wanted. It's an Ebony finish with gold  with 3 pickups and gold hardware. It was literally too good to pass up, I mean once in a lifetime, will never find again, had to buy it or never have the chance again opportunity. I tried to get financing from the dealer but it just wasn't happening so I took a credit card that had a 10,000 limit that I'd had since college and bought it. It came one day shipping and it is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. It looks and plays like a dream. \n\nMy fiance is furious that I didn't consult with her, in my take our money is our money and she shouldn't panic. Her take is that I put our financial future at risk for something silly. I'm trying to tell her its not even a risk since these guitars ALWAYS go up in value and it's been my dream. She refuses to see this and to prove it to her the music store I bought it from is willing to buy it back from me, but she's mad now that I won't just sell it back so I shouldn't have said that because I'm never getting rid of this guitar. She is also mad about putting it on a credit card but to me that's exactly what credit cards are for...to buy once in a lifetime things that we can't afford on the spot. She says that's not true at all so I guess we just have to disagree over this because that will never be how I see it. \n\nThis isn't a relationship advice post because I'm not selling or getting rid of the guitar. But I want to know I really was an asshole for buying it in the first place?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for buying a dream guitar with a credit card, leading to a conflict with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author has been playing guitar since they were 8, which shows a long-term passion. The guitar they bought is a specific, rare model they've wanted for a long time. They used a credit card with a high limit, which they had since college. Their fianc\u00e9 is upset because they didn't consult her, feel it's a financial risk, and argue about selling it back. The author thinks it's a sound investment since the guitar's value goes up, but the fianc\u00e9 disagrees.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication in a relationship. The author didn't consult their partner before making a significant purchase that uses shared financial resources. Even if the author sees it as a personal dream, the use of a credit card (which might be part of their joint finances) could strain their financial future. The fianc\u00e9's concern is valid because big purchases, especially those charged to credit, can affect both partners' financial health. The argument about credit cards being for such purchases is a personal opinion; responsible use typically involves not charging more than you can pay off, which the author might not have considered. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author mentions the store is willing to buy it back but then refuses to sell it complicates things. It might seem like an argument from both sides, but the fianc\u00e9's main issue is the lack of communication and the potential financial risk. The author's stance that \"our money is our money\" might not account for the shared nature of their finances in a committed relationship. \n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a shared financial future (like marriage plans), major purchases should involve discussion. The author's decision to act unilaterally, despite the significant financial impact, could be seen as irresponsible. Even if the guitar is an investment, the method of payment and the lack of consultation are points where the author might be at fault.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate a major financial decision with their partner, which is a key aspect of relationship responsibility.\n"
