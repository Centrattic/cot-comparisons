It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be a caretaker in a 'little' dynamic. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 'little' dynamic is. From the context, it sounds like it's a type of roleplay where one partner acts as a caretaker for the other, who might be into being treated like a child. The author looked it up and isn't interested.\n\nThe girlfriend feels rejected because she believes he doesn't accept her for who she is. The author is conflicted because he loves her but isn't comfortable with the role. He's also feeling guilty, maybe because he didn't consider her feelings enough or because friends advised him to try it.\n\nKey points to consider: The author is honest about his lack of interest. He doesn't judge her, just isn't into it. The girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014calling him an asshole and not talking to him. The author's friends suggest he should try it, but he's uncomfortable. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are crucial. If both partners can't meet halfway on something important, it might be a deal-breaker. The author isn't forcing her to do anything; he's declining a role he's not comfortable with. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her authentic self isn't accepted. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, he's being honest, even if it's hard. But maybe he could have approached the conversation with more empathy, explaining his feelings without dismissing her needs. However, it's also her responsibility to know his boundaries. Since he's clear and not pressuring her, it's a matter of differing needs. Neither is entirely wrong, but the author isn't in the wrong for saying no to something he's not comfortable with. So the answer is B.\n"
