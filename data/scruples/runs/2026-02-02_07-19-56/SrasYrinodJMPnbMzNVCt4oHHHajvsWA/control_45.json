It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for turning down being a caretaker for their girlfriend's \"little\" role. First, I need to understand what the \"little\" and \"caretaker\" refer to here. From the context, it seems like it's related to a specific dynamic, possibly a role in a relationship where one person takes on a nurturing or caretaking role. The user has been in a relationship for a year, and this came up recently. The girlfriend felt hurt because he didn't accept her for who she is, but the user is uncomfortable with it.\n\nThe user isn't judging others who choose this dynamic, but he's not into it himself. He turned her down, leading to a fight and her not talking to him. The key points here are mutual respect in relationships and consent. The user is expressing that he's not comfortable with the idea and doesn't want to participate. If both people in a relationship can't agree on a role they both want, then it's not appropriate to force the issue. The girlfriend's argument that he should accept it if he loves her might be a form of emotional pressure or manipulation. The user is standing by his own boundaries, which is important in a healthy relationship. However, there's also the aspect of communication. If the girlfriend had discussed this earlier, maybe they could have found a middle ground. Since he mentioned he's not open-minded about it and the idea makes him uncomfortable, he's not at fault for not accepting something he's not into. The friends suggesting he should try it might not understand the personal discomfort involved. The user's guilt could stem from feeling he's not meeting her needs, but it's okay to prioritize one's own comfort as long as it's communicated respectfully. So, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong because he's honest about his feelings and not forcing himself into a role he's uncomfortable with.\n"
