It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend found out he's not into being a 'caretaker' for her little persona, and they had a fight about it. The author says he looked up what it meant and isn't comfortable with it. He turned her down, and now she's not talking to him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 'caretaker' role entails in this context. From what I know, in a DDLG (Daddy Dom/Little Girl) dynamic, a caretaker might take on a parental or nurturing role. The author isn't into that, and he's not judging others who are into it, just stating his own preference.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author is clear that he doesn't want to participate, and he's not pressuring her. The girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not accepting her for who she is. But the author is also standing by his own boundaries. It's a situation where both have different needs or kinks. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend needs this dynamic to be happy, and the author can't fulfill that, then maybe the relationship isn't compatible. The author isn't forcing her to change; he's just declining a role he's not comfortable with. \n\nThe author might feel guilty because he didn't explore it more, but he's honest about his discomfort. Friends suggest trying it, but he's not convinced. It's his right to say no. The girlfriend's reaction seems intense, but if this is a core part of her identity, she might need someone who's into that dynamic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to take on that role. He's being honest and respecting his own boundaries. The wrong here, if any, might be on the girlfriend's side for pushing him to accept something he's not into, but the question is about the author. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
