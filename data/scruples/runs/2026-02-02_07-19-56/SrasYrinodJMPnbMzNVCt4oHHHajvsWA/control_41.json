It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend's request to be her \"caretaker\" in a little role. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe couple has been dating for a year. The girlfriend recently came out about being a \"little,\" which the author didn't know about and looked up. He's not interested in that dynamic. He turned her down, leading to a fight and her not talking to him. She feels he's not accepting her, while he feels uncomfortable and thinks it's a phase. Friends suggested he try it, but he feels weird about it.\n\nNow, to figure out if he's in the wrong. The key points are consent, mutual respect, and personal boundaries. The author is saying he's not into that role and doesn't want to participate. If both partners have to agree on aspects of their relationship, then the author is right to set his boundaries. It's his right to say no to something that makes him uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend might feel that her needs are being ignored. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's honest about his feelings and isn't pressuring her, he's not being disrespectful. It's a matter of differing needs. So the answer is B.\n"
