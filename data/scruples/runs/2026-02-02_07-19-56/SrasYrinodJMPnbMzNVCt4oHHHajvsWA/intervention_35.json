It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend have been dating for a year. She recently came out as being a \"little,\" which he researched and decided he didn't want to be part of. He turned down her request to be her caretaker. Now she's upset and hasn't spoken to him, leading to a fight. He's feeling guilty because he wasn't open-minded when he looked up what it meant and is confused because friends told him to try it, but he's uncomfortable.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to form my own opinion.\n\nLooking at the key points: The author made a decision based on his own discomfort with the role. He doesn't judge others who choose this dynamic, just says it's not for him. The girlfriend feels rejected and that he doesn't accept her. The conflict arises because she values this part of her identity, and he isn't willing to participate.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and acceptance of each other's needs are crucial. If one partner has a significant aspect of their identity that the other cannot accept, it can lead to problems. However, the author isn't forcing her to change her preferences; he's stating his own boundaries. But if she needs this dynamic for her happiness, refusing might be a deal-breaker for her. \n\nThe author's guilt comes from feeling he should have been more open-minded. But it's also his right to have personal boundaries. The key here is whether he's wrong for setting those boundaries. Since the situation is new to him and he's honest about his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the relationship requires this dynamic and he can't accept it, it might be a fundamental incompatibility. \n\nThe friends' advice to try it might not consider his discomfort. The problem here is that both need to communicate and find a middle ground. However, if the author isn't willing to engage in something that's important to her, he might be the one not accepting her. But he's also not being disrespectful; he's just not interested. \n\nIn many cases, being in a relationship requires compromise. If she can't accept his refusal, maybe it's not the right relationship. But if he's not willing to try something that's a core part of her, he might be the problem. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's honest about his feelings and respects her without judgment, maybe he's not the asshole. But if he's dismissing her needs without understanding, he might be. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not wrong for setting his boundaries. The issue is more about compatibility. So the answer would be B, he's not the asshole. But I need to check if there's any aspect where he overstepped. Since he's not pressuring her to change, just stating his limits, he's probably not in the wrong.\n"
