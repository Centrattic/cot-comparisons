It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be a 'caretaker' in a 'little' dynamic. First, I need to understand what 'little' refers to here. From the context, it's likely talking about a relationship where one person takes on a caretaker role, possibly involving role-playing or a specific kink. The author mentions looking it up and not wanting any part in it.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The author clearly states his boundaries and turned down the request. He explains that he doesn't feel comfortable with the role and that it's not his thing. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that acceptance of this aspect is necessary for her to be with him, leading to a conflict.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners can agree on terms that respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't forcing the girlfriend to do anything; he's declining a role he's uncomfortable with. However, the girlfriend is taking this refusal as a rejection of her identity, which she might see as essential to her. The author might be in the right if he's given her space to process and hasn't pressured him. But if he hasn't engaged in further communication to understand her perspective or find a compromise, that could be an issue. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's honest and set his boundaries, it's not necessarily his fault. The issue might be more about differing values or what each partner considers essential in a relationship. The friends suggest trying it, but the author feels weird. Ultimately, if both can't meet in the middle, it's a matter of compatibility. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his limits.\n"
