It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend wants to engage in a \"little\" dynamic, which the author isn't comfortable with. He turned her down, and now there's some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the caretaker role in a \"little\" dynamic entails. From what I know, it's a type of roleplay where one partner (the caretaker) takes on a nurturing role, treating the other as a child. It's a consensual adult activity, similar to other kinks or role-playing in relationships. The key here is consent and mutual agreement.\n\nThe author says he looked up what it meant and decided he doesn't want to be part of it. He doesn't judge others who do, but he's not into it. He turned her down, and she's upset, feeling that he's not accepting her. They had a fight where she said he's an asshole, and he feels guilty for not being open-minded enough.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. In healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the author isn't comfortable with this dynamic, it's his right to express that. However, communication is key. Did he communicate his feelings clearly? The article mentions he said he's not into it, so he did express his position.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not accepting her. But acceptance should be mutual. If the author is genuinely not interested, he can't be forced to participate. However, maybe there's a disconnect in how they're communicating. The author is feeling guilty because others suggested he try it, but he's uncomfortable. It's important to follow his own comfort level, as consent requires both parties to be comfortable.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she's not talking to him and called him an asshole. That might indicate that she's not handling the situation well. But the author isn't in the wrong for standing by his boundaries. If a relationship requires one person to do something they're fundamentally uncomfortable with, that's a problem. The key is whether both can find a middle ground or agree on terms that work for both. If the author isn't willing to try it, and the girlfriend can't accept that, maybe the relationship is incompatible.\n\nSo, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong for rejecting a role he's not comfortable with. Both need to respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend might need to accept his position if she's to stay in the relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
