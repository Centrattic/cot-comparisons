It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with his girlfriend. She recently came out to him about being a 'little', which he had to look up. He found out what it is and decided he doesn't want to be her 'caretaker', which I assume refers to a dynamic in a 'littles and caregivers' relationship. He says he doesn't judge other couples who have such relationships but isn't comfortable with it himself. They had a fight where she said he's not accepting her for who she is, and he felt guilty because he didn't explore the idea open-mindedly. Mutual friends suggested he try it, but he's still uncomfortable. He loves her but can't do something that feels wrong to him.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for turning her down. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. \n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The girlfriend introduced a new aspect of her identity that she's been keeping to herself for a while. The author didn't know about it and, after researching, found it unappealing. He turned her down because he's not into it. She's upset because she feels he's not accepting her, leading to a conflict and her not talking to him. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication and mutual respect are essential. The girlfriend wanted to express her needs and desires, which is important. The author's response was to say no, but the question is whether that was wrong. \n\nThe author doesn't seem to be judging her or other people for having such relationships. He just doesn't want to participate. He's honest about his feelings and boundaries. On the other hand, the girlfriend's argument is that if he loves her, he should accept her. That's a bit of a slippery slope because love should be about mutual respect and consent, not expecting the other person to change or participate in something they're fundamentally against. \n\nHowever, the fact that she didn't mention this before might be a red flag. The author says it's a new development, and she acted like it's a major part of her identity that he should accept. Maybe she didn't discuss it earlier because she thought he might not be into it, or she was testing the waters. But the author is clear that he's not comfortable with it. \n\nThe friends suggest he try it, but personal discomfort isn't something you should have to force yourself to overcome unless both parties are willing and the activity is consensual and within legal/ethical bounds. The author is not in the wrong if he's being honest about his limits. \n\nOn the flip side, the girlfriend's right to her own preferences and identity is valid. But in a relationship, both people need to meet in the middle. If one partner is not willing to engage in a consensual activity that the other wants, it's a matter of differing values or desires. The author's guilt might stem from feeling he didn't consider it enough, but he did look it up and made a decision based on his own comfort. \n\nSo, the core issue is whether refusing to participate in something consensual that one's partner wants is wrong. Since the author is not forcing her to do anything and is honest about his boundaries, I think he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's reaction is about her not being accepted, but the author is stating his own limits. Relationships should respect each other's boundaries unless they're harmful. Here, the 'littles' dynamic is consensual between adults, so the author's refusal is about personal preference, not judgment. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
