It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about turning down a girlfriend's request to be a caretaker in a \"little\" dynamic. The author of the post is unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The couple has been dating for a year. The girlfriend introduced the idea of being a \"little\" and asked the guy to be a caretaker. The guy looked it up, found out what it is (which is a specific relationship dynamic where one person acts as a parent figure and the other as a child), and decided against it. He doesn't want to do it, even though he doesn't judge others who do. The girlfriend is upset, hasn't talked to him, and says he's an asshole for not considering it. The guy feels guilty but isn't into it and the thought makes him uncomfortable. Friends suggested he try it, but he's still not comfortable.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong by declining. The answer should be A or B.\n\nIn relationships, it's generally accepted that both partners should be okay with certain aspects. If one partner has a specific kink or dynamic they want, the other isn't obligated to comply if it makes them uncomfortable. The key points here are mutual respect and consent. The guy isn't forcing her to change; he's declining a role that he's not comfortable with. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is saying that her identity is tied to this dynamic and that he's not accepting her for who she is. \n\nHowever, the problem arises when one partner's needs are non-negotiable and the other feels pressured. The guy is clear that he's not into it, and the girlfriend is taking it as a rejection of her as a person. It's possible that the girlfriend didn't communicate this need earlier, leading to the situation now. The guy's right to set boundaries is important. But the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as extreme if she can't accept his refusal without ending the relationship.\n\nBut the main question is about the author's wrongdoing. If he's honest about his feelings and isn't pressuring her in return, then he's not in the wrong. He's not dismissing her feelings entirely but is firm in his own. The girlfriend's response might be more about her inability to accept his stance rather than the guy's actions. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), because respecting personal boundaries is crucial in a relationship. If the girlfriend can't accept that, the issue lies with her willingness to adjust or accept his limits.\n"
