It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author turning down his girlfriend's request to be her \"caretaker\" in a \"little\" relationship, which he later found out is part of a dynamic where one partner acts more dominant and the other more submissive. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for a year. She recently came out about wanting this dynamic, which he wasn't aware of until he looked it up. He turned her down, leading to a fight and her not talking to him. He feels guilty because he wasn't open-minded when researching it, but he's not comfortable. Friends suggest he should try it, but he's weirded out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The choices are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not). \n\nConsidering the factors: The author had no prior knowledge of this dynamic before the girlfriend mentioned it. He did research and decided it wasn't for him. The girlfriend says she can't date someone who doesn't accept her, which is a big deal. The author's stance is about personal comfort and not wanting to act in a way that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nRelationships require mutual consent and comfort. If one partner has a non-negotiable aspect of their identity, the other person's refusal could be seen as a deal-breaker. However, the author is clear he doesn't want to participate, which is his right. The girlfriend is in a tough spot because her needs aren't being met. \n\nIs the author wrong for not agreeing? It depends on the context. If the dynamic is a core part of her identity and she can't accept a partner who doesn't engage in it, then the author's refusal is a valid decision. But if the relationship requires compromise and he's unwilling to meet her halfway, that could be seen as the issue. However, the author isn't refusing to accept her; he's refusing to take on a role he's not comfortable with. The key is whether the refusal is due to lack of respect or personal boundaries. Since he doesn't judge others but knows it's not for him, it's more about personal boundaries than rejection of her as a person. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to participate in something he's uncomfortable with. The girlfriend's reaction (calling him an asshole, saying he doesn't accept her) might be more about her needs not being met rather than the author being wrong. So the answer would be B (No, he's not wrong).\n"
