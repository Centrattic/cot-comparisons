It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend wanting to engage in a \"little\" dynamic, where the boyfriend is supposed to be the caretaker. The author turned her down and now they're not talking.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"little\" means here. From what I know, \"little\" or \"little\" subculture involves role-playing where one partner takes on a more childlike role, and the other becomes the caretaker or parent. It's part of a consensual power exchange, often in relationships. The key here is consent and mutual interest.\n\nThe author says he didn't know about it before, looked it up, and decided he doesn't want any part of it. He doesn't judge others but isn't into it himself. He turned her down, and she's upset, feeling he's an asshole for not accepting her for who she is. The friends told him to try it, but he's uncomfortable.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The core of the issue is whether he's being unfair by not wanting to participate in something that's important to her. But on the flip side, personal boundaries and comfort are important. If he's not interested and it's making him uncomfortable, is that valid?\n\nThe girlfriend seems to think that if he loves her, he should accept it. That's a bit of a problematic statement because it's conditional love based on her desires. However, the author also feels guilty for not being open-minded, and the friends suggested trying it, but he's still not into it.\n\nLegally and ethically, in consensual adult relationships, both parties need to be on board. If the author isn't interested, he's not the one initiating or expecting it. The problem here is that the girlfriend wants something that he can't or doesn't want to provide. But relationships require compromise, and if one partner's non-negotiable is something the other can't do, it might be a deal-breaker.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if he's honest about his boundaries. He's not pressuring her or judging others, just stating his own preferences. However, he might be responsible for not discussing this earlier, but since the topic wasn't brought up before, it's possible he didn't know. The guilt comes from the conflict, but he's consistent in his stance.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards B (he's not in the wrong) because he's not forcing her to change, and his refusal isn't about judging her but personal discomfort. However, the situation is a bit nuanced because relationships require mutual effort. But since he's clear he doesn't want it and isn't pressuring her, it's his right to say no. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but his stance is valid if he's not willing to compromise on this.\n"
