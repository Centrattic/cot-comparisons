It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is in a one-year relationship with his girlfriend. She recently came out about being a \"little,\" which he looked up and decided he didn't want to be part of. He turned her down when she asked him to be her \"caretaker,\" and now she's upset and hasn't talked to him. The author is feeling guilty and is wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider what being a \"little\" entails. From what I know, it's part of a dynamic where one person (the 'little') enjoys being treated like a child, and the other (the 'caretaker') takes on a parental role. It's a consensual arrangement, but it's specific to their desires and comfort levels.\n\nThe author says he doesn't judge others who are into this dynamic but isn't interested himself. He turned her down because he felt uncomfortable treating her like a child. He also mentions that she's never brought this topic up before, leading him to think it might be a phase. She, on the other hand, feels he doesn't accept her for who she is and called him an asshole. The mutual friends suggested he try it, but he feels weird about it.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, mutual respect, and communication. The author was honest about his feelings, even if it was uncomfortable for both of them. The girlfriend wanted a specific dynamic that he's not comfortable with. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to express their boundaries without fear of judgment. The author isn't forcing her to change who she is; he's stating his own boundaries. Conversely, she might feel that her needs aren't being met and that he's rejecting an essential part of her identity.\n\nBut, if the author isn't into the dynamic, can he be forced to participate? Relationships require compromise, but not at the expense of one's own comfort. It's important that both partners are on the same page. If she's unhappy with the refusal, maybe this isn't the right match for her. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to do something that makes him uncomfortable, especially if he's upfront about it. However, if the relationship is to work, there needs to be mutual respect for each other's boundaries. The fact that she's upset and hasn't communicated further might indicate a deeper issue about how she handles differing opinions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't the asshole here because he's being honest about his boundaries. The girlfriend is within her right to feel hurt, but the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in a dynamic he's not comfortable with. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
