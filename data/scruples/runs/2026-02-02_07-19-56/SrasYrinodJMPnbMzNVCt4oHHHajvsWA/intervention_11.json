It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author turning down his girlfriend's request to be a 'caretaker' in a 'little' relationship dynamic. The author isn't into it, doesn't want to treat her like a kid, and it's causing a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 'little' relationship is. From what I know, it's part of the age play or power exchange dynamics in relationships, where one partner (the 'little') takes on a more childlike role, and the other (the 'caretaker' or 'big') provides care and guidance. It's a consensual arrangement for some couples, but not everyone is into it.\n\nThe author says he looked it up and doesn't want any part in it. He turned her down, and now she's not talking to him. He feels guilty because he wasn't open-minded when looking into it, and friends suggested he try it, but he's uncomfortable. He's questioning if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and personal boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to express their needs and boundaries without pressure. The author made his stance clear, so he's not being forced into something he's not comfortable with. However, the girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not accepting her for who she is. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in this dynamic if he's not into it. It's his right to set boundaries. However, the way the conflict was handled might matter. Was he respectful in his refusal? Did he give reasons? The post mentions they fought, with her saying if he loved her he would accept it. That sounds like emotional pressure, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe author's guilt might come from feeling he didn't consider her enough, but he's also not obligated to change his preferences for someone else. The friends' advice to try it might be well-meaning, but if the author's not interested, it's not his responsibility to conform. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. He's staying true to his boundaries, which is important. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her needs not being met, but that doesn't make him at fault. So Answer B.\n"
