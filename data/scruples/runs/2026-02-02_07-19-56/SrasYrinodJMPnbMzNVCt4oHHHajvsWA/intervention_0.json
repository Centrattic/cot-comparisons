It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about the girlfriend wanting to explore being a 'little' and asking the author to be her caretaker. The author didn't know about this before and after looking it up, turned her down. Now she's upset and hasn't talked to him in a while.\n\nFirst, I should understand what being a 'little' entails. From what I know, it's part of a dynamic where one person takes on a more childlike role, and the other acts as a parent or caretaker. It's a consensual arrangement, similar to other forms of relationship exploration like D/s dynamics. The key here is consent and mutual agreement.\n\nThe author mentions that he doesn't want to participate but isn't judging others who do. That's important because he's not condemning the practice itself. He's just not comfortable with it personally. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that if he truly loved her, he would accept her as she is, including this aspect. She sees this as a deal-breaker, while the author feels that he shouldn't have to do something he's uncomfortable with, even if it's for her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main points to consider are communication, consent, and mutual respect. The girlfriend brought up this aspect after a year, which might have been unexpected. The author took the time to research it, which shows he tried to understand her needs, but ultimately decided it wasn't for him. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial that both partners are on the same page regarding their comfort levels and boundaries. If one partner has a non-negotiable aspect of their identity that the other is unwilling to accept, it can lead to conflict. The author's refusal isn't about rejecting her as a person but his own limits. However, the girlfriend feels rejected and sees this as a lack of acceptance of her true self.\n\nThe friends suggested he should try it, but the author feels uncomfortable even considering it. That's his right. Everyone has different boundaries, and respecting those is key. But the girlfriend's perspective is that her authentic self is part of what she needs in the relationship. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether the author being unwilling to participate in this dynamic is a deal-breaker for her. If she can't accept that he's not into it, then maybe the relationship isn't viable for her. However, the author isn't pressuring her to stop being who she is; he's just not part of the dynamic. It's a mutual respect issue. If the author is clear that he won't participate, and she feels that's a deal-breaker, then maybe the problem isn't entirely on the author. But the author's refusal isn't wrong because he's not being forced to do something he's uncomfortable with. \n\nBut wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend feels that her identity is being rejected, then the author might be in the wrong by not being open-minded enough. However, the author isn't being judgmental; he's just not interested. The line between respecting her needs and respecting his own is tricky here. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's being honest about his limits. It's up to the girlfriend whether she can accept those limits. But if she can't, it's not the author's fault. The conflict arises from differing needs and boundaries, and both have valid perspectives. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, I'd say he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
