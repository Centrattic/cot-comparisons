It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants the boyfriend to be her \"caretaker,\" which the boyfriend turns down. He says he looked up what being a \"little\" entails and doesn't want any part of it. Now they're in a conflict, and the guy is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The term \"little\" here might refer to a dynamic where one person takes on a more nurturing or caregiver role, possibly involving age play or power exchange. The boyfriend didn't know about this before, so he looked it up and decided against it. The girlfriend feels that he's not accepting her for who she is, leading to a fight.\n\nNow, considering the question: is the guy in the wrong? The key points are about consent and mutual respect in a relationship. If both partners are supposed to be comfortable with their roles and boundaries, then the guy's refusal might be justified if he's not comfortable. However, if the girlfriend's identity is deeply tied to this dynamic, then refusing could be seen as rejecting her as a person, which is a problem.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend said she can't date someone who doesn't accept her, implying that his refusal is a deal-breaker. The guy loves her but isn't comfortable. The friends suggested he try it, but he feels weird. The question is whether he's wrong for not wanting to engage in something he's uncomfortable with.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, relationships require mutual respect. If one partner has a significant part of their identity that the other can't accept, it might not be sustainable. However, the guy isn't forcing her; he's just saying no. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that her needs are not being met. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether it's fair for the girlfriend to expect the guy to take on a role that makes him uncomfortable. If she's brought this up and he's honest about his feelings, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if the refusal is causing significant harm without any attempt to find a middle ground, maybe there's some fault. But given that he's honest and not willing to compromise on something he's genuinely uncomfortable with, it's possible he's not the asshole. \n\nSo I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his boundaries. If the relationship can't continue without that dynamic, then it's a matter of mutual compatibility. The guy isn't obligated to agree to something he's not comfortable with, especially if it's a core part of his identity.\n"
