It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author turning down their girlfriend's request to be a caretaker in a \"littles\" dynamic. The key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual consent in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what being a \"caretaker\" in this context means. From what I know, \"littles\" is part of the adult roleplay where one person acts as a parent or caretaker. The author didn't know about this before and after looking it up, they don't want to participate. The girlfriend feels rejected because he didn't accept her as she is, which is a common AITA scenario.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're not comfortable with treating their girlfriend like a child. They mention they don't judge others but aren't into it themselves. The girlfriend's reaction is that he's not accepting her, which led to a fight. Friends suggest trying it, but the author feels it's not right for them.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have mutual respect and boundaries. The author isn't forcing the girlfriend to change her preferences, just declining to participate. They're not in the wrong if they're honest about their feelings. The girlfriend's reaction, while hurtful, might be due to her strong feelings about this dynamic. The question is whether refusing to engage in a partner's kink is wrong if it's not consensual for both. Since consent requires both parties to be okay, the author isn't at fault here. They have the right to their boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
