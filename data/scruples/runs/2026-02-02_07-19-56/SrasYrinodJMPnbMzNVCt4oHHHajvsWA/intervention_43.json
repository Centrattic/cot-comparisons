It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend wanting to be a \"little\" and the author turning her down. First, I need to understand what it means to be a \"little\" in this context. From what I know, the \"little\" role is part of a power dynamic where one person (the caretaker) takes on a more nurturing or authoritative role, and the other (the little) adopts a more childlike or submissive role. It's consensual and part of some relationships, but not everyone is into it.\n\nThe author mentions that he had no idea about this before his girlfriend brought it up. He looked it up and decided he didn't want to be part of it. Now, she's upset and hasn't talked to him in a while. She's saying he should accept her for who she is, and he feels guilty for not being open-minded enough. His friends suggested he try it, but he's uncomfortable even considering it.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong for turning her down. Let's break it down. In a healthy relationship, both partners should feel respected and comfortable. If one partner has a non-negotiable that the other is unwilling to meet, it's a problem. The author is clear that he doesn't want to participate in this dynamic. He's not judging others who do, just stating his own boundaries. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend is upset because she feels her identity isn't accepted. She might see this as a fundamental part of who she is, and he's refusing to engage with it. On the other hand, the author is also standing by his own feelings and doesn't want to force himself into a role that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect. If the girlfriend's needs are such that she needs a caretaker role to feel fulfilled, and the author can't meet that need, then it's a deal-breaker for her. But the author isn't in the wrong for having his own boundaries. He isn't forcing her to leave; she's choosing to end the relationship because of his refusal. \n\nThe author isn't being dismissive; he's explaining his discomfort and has a right to his own comfort. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for expecting him to accept something he's fundamentally opposed to. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because he's respecting his own boundaries, which is valid in a relationship.\n"
