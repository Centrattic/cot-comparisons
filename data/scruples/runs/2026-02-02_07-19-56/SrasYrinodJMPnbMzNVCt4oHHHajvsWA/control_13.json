It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants the boyfriend to be her \"caretaker\" in the context of being a \"little,\" which I think refers to a caretaker dynamic in an adult relationship, maybe involving some sort of role-play or power exchange. The boyfriend turned her down and now they're having issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend found out about this aspect of his girlfriend's interests and declined to participate. He doesn't judge others who are into it but isn't comfortable himself. The girlfriend feels he's not accepting her for who she is, leading to a fight and her being upset. Friends suggested he should try it, but he feels weird about it.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider aspects of consent, mutual respect in relationships, and personal boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If one partner has a specific interest or need, the other isn't obligated to fulfill it if it goes against their personal comfort. However, communication is key. The boyfriend might have made an effort to explain his feelings, but maybe the way he declined could have been handled better.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel rejected or unaccepted, which is valid if she sees this aspect as integral to her identity. But the boyfriend also has the right to his own boundaries. The key is whether he was considerate in his response and whether there was a mutual understanding. The fact that he looked it up and was open-minded initially shows he tried to understand, but ultimately felt uncomfortable. His friends' opinions might not align with his personal comfort level.\n\nSo, the boyfriend isn't necessarily in the wrong for declining. However, the way the situation escalated might indicate a need for more effective communication. But since he's not forcing her to change and is honest about his feelings, he's not the asshole. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
