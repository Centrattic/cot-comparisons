It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her 'caretaker' in the context of a 'little' dynamic. First, I need to understand what a 'little' dynamic entails. From what I know, it's a consensual role-play where one partner takes a more childlike role, and the other acts as a caretaker. It's part of a broader kink or fetish culture.\n\nThe author is in a relationship and found out about this through his girlfriend. He did some research and decided he's not into it. He turned her down, and now they're having issues. The key points here are consent, mutual agreement, and personal boundaries. \n\nThe author hasn't judged others who are into it, but he's not interested himself. He's trying to be honest about his feelings. The girlfriend is upset and feels rejected, which is understandable because her needs or desires aren't being met. However, the author is also not willing to compromise on something that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's boundaries. If one partner is not open to a certain aspect that's important to the other, it's a matter of whether they can find a middle ground or if it's a deal-breaker. The author's friends suggested trying it, but he's not comfortable. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether he was disrespectful or dismissive. From the text, he didn't mock her or refuse outright without discussion. He said he doesn't want to do it, which is his right. If both parties have discussed it and the girlfriend is still upset, maybe she needs to consider if this is a deal-breaker for her. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's statement that she can't date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is suggests that this dynamic is a core part of her identity. The author's refusal might be seen as not accepting her, which could be a valid reason for her to feel hurt. But the author isn't in the wrong if he's being honest about his preferences. It's a matter of mutual respect. \n\nIn relationships, people have different needs, and it's possible they're incompatible in this aspect. The author isn't the asshole if he's being genuine and not pressuring her into anything else. The guilt comes from not being open-minded, but he's also not obligated to do something that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. Both sides have valid points, but it's a matter of mutual acceptance and whether they can find a way forward given their differing needs.\n"
