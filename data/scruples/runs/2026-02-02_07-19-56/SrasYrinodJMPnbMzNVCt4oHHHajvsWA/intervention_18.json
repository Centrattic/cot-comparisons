It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants him to be her \"caretaker\" in the context of being a \"little,\" which I know is part of a relationship dynamic where one person acts younger. The author didn't know about this before and, after looking it up, decided he doesn't want to be involved. He turned her down, and now she's upset, feeling like he's not accepting her. The author is conflicted because he loves her but isn't comfortable with this arrangement. His friends told him to try it, but he feels weird about it. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the key factor here is mutual consent and comfort in the relationship. In healthy relationships, both partners need to be on the same page about the dynamics they want. The author wasn't aware of this aspect of his girlfriend's preferences until she brought it up. He researched it and decided it wasn't for him. The question is whether turning down a request for a specific dynamic makes him the asshole.\n\nThe author isn't judging her; he says he doesn't judge others who are into it. He's honest about his feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend, however, is upset because she feels he's not accepting her for who she is, which is a valid concern if she's been into this for a while. But the key point is that he didn't know about this before and isn't willing to participate. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't being disrespectful. He's communicating his boundaries. The girlfriend might feel rejected, but if the dynamic is important to her, maybe it's a deal-breaker. However, if she hadn't mentioned it before, it's possible she didn't realize how significant it was to her. \n\nThe friends suggesting he try it might be well-meaning, but if the author genuinely feels uncomfortable, he's not obligated to comply. The problem here isn't about being wrong per se, but about differing needs and expectations. If both can't meet in the middle, it might be a sign that the relationship isn't compatible. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's honest about his feelings. However, there's also a case for considering communication. Maybe he could have been more open-minded, but if he still feels uncomfortable after researching, it's his right to say no. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but it's also her right to feel that way if this dynamic is a core part of her identity. \n\nSo, in the end, it's a complex situation. The author isn't necessarily the asshole for setting boundaries, but it's a situation where both sides have valid points. However, since the question is a binary choice, the answer would depend on whether the author breached any social norms. Since he's honest and not malicious, I'd lean towards B (Not the Asshole).\n"
