It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her 'caretaker' in a 'Little' dynamic. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what the 'Little' dynamic entails. From what I know, it's a type of consensual power exchange relationship where one partner (the 'little') may adopt childlike behaviors, and the other (the 'caretaker' or 'big') takes on a parental role. It's part of the broader BDSM or alternative relationship spectrum.\n\nThe author states he looked up what it meant and found he doesn't want any part of it. He turned her down, which led to a conflict. He's feeling guilty and confused because friends suggested he try it, but he's uncomfortable. The key points here are consent, mutual respect, and personal boundaries.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset, saying he's an asshole for not accepting her for who she is. She might feel that her authentic self is being rejected. But the author is clear that he's not interested and doesn't want to participate in something that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners have the right to set boundaries. If the dynamic was discussed early on, maybe there could be compromise or finding another way. But since the author isn't interested and the girlfriend is making it a deal-breaker, it's a matter of differing needs and values.\n\nThe friends' advice to try it isn't necessarily valid if the author isn't comfortable. Forcing someone into a dynamic they don't want isn't consensual. The author isn't being judgmental of others' choices, just stating his own lack of interest.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling her needs aren't met, but the author isn't obligated to fulfill them if they conflict with his own. The fact that this is a new aspect of her personality not discussed before could also be a red flag about communication in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and honesty. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend can't accept that, maybe the issue is deeper about whether she respects his boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
