It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting her partner to be a 'caretaker' in a little role, which he turned down. He's been with her for a year, and this came up suddenly. He says he looked it up and isn't into it, but he doesn't judge others who are. Now she's upset and hasn't spoken to him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The key points are consent, mutual respect, and boundaries. The author is clear that he isn't interested in that aspect of their relationship. The girlfriend feels that he's not accepting her for who she is, leading to a fight. The author is questioning if he's in the wrong by not being open to it.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should be able to express their needs and boundaries. The author is being honest about his lack of interest, which is not inherently wrong. However, if the girlfriend felt that this was part of her identity and he's not willing to accommodate it at all, that could be a problem. The fact that he says he looked it up and felt uncomfortable is important. It shows he tried to understand, but it's not for him.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also part of the equation. If she's using this as a dealbreaker, then it's a matter of compatibility. The author isn't pressuring her into anything, but he's also not willing to engage in something that makes him uncomfortable. The friends' advice to at least try it might be well-meaning, but if the author really isn't into it, forcing himself could lead to resentment.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for setting a boundary. If the relationship requires him to do something he's not comfortable with and he's honest about it, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels that her needs are being dismissed, that's a different angle. The key is mutual respect. The author isn't being judgmental towards others, just stating his own preferences. If the girlfriend can't accept that, maybe the issue is more about compatibility. So, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong for not accepting something he's not comfortable with, as long as he's being respectful and honest."
