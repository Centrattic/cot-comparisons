It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend's request to be her \"caretaker.\" The author provided the context of a one-year relationship that was going smoothly until the girlfriend introduced this aspect of being a 'little,' which the author looked up and decided wasn't for them. The girlfriend is upset, feeling judged, and the author is conflicted between not wanting to do something they're uncomfortable with and feeling guilty for not being open-minded.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the term \"caretaker\" in this context. From the description, it seems related to a \"little\" dynamic, which I believe is part of a power exchange or ageplay in relationships. The author isn't into it, which is their personal preference. The key points here are consent, mutual respect, and whether the author is being closed-minded. \n\nThe author says they don't judge others who are into this, but it's a new development in the relationship. The girlfriend feels that the author isn't accepting her for who she is, which is a valid concern because in a healthy relationship, both partners should accept each other's preferences and boundaries. However, the author is clear that they are not comfortable with this role. The question is if the author is wrong for refusing. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate boundaries honestly. If the author isn't interested in this dynamic, they have the right to say no. However, the girlfriend's non-negotiable stance might indicate that this is a deal-breaker for her. The author might feel they're in a tough spot because they love the girlfriend but can't meet this specific desire. \n\nThe mutual friends suggested trying it, but the author is uneasy. The guilt comes from maybe not being open enough or not considering it fully. However, the author already did consider it and decided it doesn't align with their comfort. \n\nSo, the author isn't at fault for not wanting to engage in something they're not comfortable with, as long as they communicated that respect. The girlfriend's reaction is her issue if she can't accept the author's limitations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
