It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her 'caretaker' in a little relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been dating his girlfriend for a year, and it's been smooth until she brought up being a 'little'. He looked it up, decided he doesn't want any part in it, and turned her down. Now she's upset, hasn't talked to him in a while, and they had a fight. He's feeling guilty but also uncomfortable. His friends told him to try it, but he's not into it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent, mutual respect in relationships, and personal boundaries. The girlfriend wants the relationship to include this dynamic, but the author isn't interested. The question is whether he's wrong for not complying.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should be able to express their needs and boundaries. It's important that neither feels forced into something they're not comfortable with. The author is clear that he doesn't want to participate, which is his right. On the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not accepting her for who she is. But acceptance doesn't mean you have to participate in every aspect of the other person's identity if it goes against your own comfort.\n\nThe author isn't being closed-minded just for not wanting to engage. The fact that he didn't judge others who are into it shows he's not prejudiced, but he's honest about his own preferences. The problem arises if he's being dismissive or disrespectful, but the situation as described doesn't indicate that. He communicated his feelings, even if it was difficult.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. She says she can't date someone who doesn't accept her, which is a valid stance for her, but if the author isn't willing to meet her halfway here, he's not the one violating the relationship's terms. It's a matter of differing needs. The friends suggesting he should try it might be well-meaning, but ultimately, the decision has to be his. It's not about being open-minded if it makes him uncomfortable.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong because he's being honest about his boundaries. It's a tough situation, but he's not obligated to participate in something that makes him uneasy. The girlfriend's frustration is her issue to work through, and the relationship might need to adjust or part ways if this is a deal-breaker for her.\n"
