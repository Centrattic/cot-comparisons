It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be a caretaker in a \"littles\" dynamic. First, I need to understand what a \"little\" dynamic entails. From what I know, it's a relationship where one person (the \"little\") acts like a child, and the other (the \"caretaker\") takes on a parent-like role. It's a consensual kink, so both parties must agree.\n\nThe author mentions he's been with his girlfriend for a year, and she recently came out about being a \"little.\" He looked it up and decided he doesn't want to participate. He turned her down, leading to a fight and her not talking to him. Now he's feeling guilty, questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nI need to determine if he's at fault. The key points here are consent, mutual respect, and communication. The girlfriend expressed her needs; the author explained his discomfort. The issue is whether refusing to participate in a consensual dynamic makes him wrong. Consent is mutual and requires both parties to be okay with the terms. If one person isn't comfortable, they can't be forced. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about accepting her for who she is, which is valid. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to engage in something that makes him uncomfortable. Relationships require compromise, but not to the point of personal discomfort if it's a deal-breaker.\n\nThe friends advised him to try it, but he feels weirded out. That's his personal boundary. The question is whether his refusal is unjust. Since he's clear about his stance and it's non-negotiable for him, he's not in the wrong. However, he might need to reflect on communication and whether there's another way to meet her needs without involving this dynamic. But in terms of right or wrong, the answer likely leans toward not being in the wrong (B).\n"
