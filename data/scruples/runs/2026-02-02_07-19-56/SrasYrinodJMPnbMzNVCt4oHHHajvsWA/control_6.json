It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThe author has been dating their girlfriend for about a year, and everything was going smoothly until she brought up being a 'little'. They didn't know what that meant, looked it up, and decided they didn't want to be involved. Now she's upset and hasn't talked to them in a while. They mention that they turned her down, she said they're an asshole for not considering it, and mutual friends suggested they try it. The author feels guilty because they looked it up but aren't comfortable with the idea. They love her but don't want to do something they're not okay with.\n\nFirst, I should consider what being a 'little' and a 'caretaker' in this context means. From what I know, in the context of relationships, 'little' usually refers to a dynamic where one person (the little) wants to engage in a role-playing scenario as a child, and the other (the caretaker) takes on a parental or nurturing role. It's a consensual and negotiated part of some relationships, often within the realm of D/s (Dominant/submissive) dynamics.\n\nThe author's main point is that they don't want to be a caretaker, and they don't judge couples who do, but they're uncomfortable with this request. The girlfriend is upset because she feels her authentic self isn't accepted, and the author is feeling guilty but also stuck because they don't want to do something they're not into.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for declining this request? The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel comfortable and respected. If one partner has a specific kink or dynamic they want to explore and the other isn't interested, that's a valid concern. The key here is consent and mutual respect. The author isn't trying to shame the idea but has decided it's not for them. The girlfriend, however, seems to feel that her needs are being disregarded, which is also important. \n\nThe author says they looked up what it was and decided they didn't want it. They also mention that they love their girlfriend and don't want to do something they're not comfortable with. The friends suggested trying it, but the author is still uncomfortable. The girlfriend might see this as a rejection of her identity or desires, while the author sees it as a personal boundary.\n\nI think the core issue is whether the author is respecting their partner's needs. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the author isn't accepting her for who she is. However, the author is also within their rights to say no if it makes them uncomfortable. It's possible that the girlfriend expected the author to be more open-minded, but the author isn't into it regardless. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't judging her but isn't willing to participate. The girlfriend's argument is that if you love someone, you should accept all parts of them. But that's a complex issue. Acceptance doesn't always mean agreeing to every request, especially if it goes against your personal boundaries. The author might not be at fault for not wanting to engage in a dynamic they find weird. However, the way the author handled the situation could matter. If they were dismissive or hurtful, maybe. But from the description, they seem to have considered it and then made a decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have communicated her needs as a significant part of her identity, and the author's refusal could feel like a rejection. But again, unless the author is in a committed dynamic where they've already agreed to certain terms, it's their right to set boundaries. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set personal boundaries and not engage in activities they find uncomfortable. However, the situation could be more nuanced if there were prior discussions or if the dynamic was integral to the relationship. But given that it's a new request and the author isn't willing, it's their prerogative. The girlfriend's response is valid from her perspective, but the author isn't obligated to comply with a request that makes them uncomfortable.\n"
