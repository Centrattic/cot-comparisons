It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her 'caretaker' in a 'little' dynamic. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been dating for a year. The girlfriend recently came out about wanting to be a 'little,' which the author had to look up. He found out he doesn't want to be part of it. He turned her down, and now she's upset, saying he's not accepting her. They had a fight. Friends say he should try it, but he feels weird about it. He's feeling guilty but isn't comfortable with the idea.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong).\n\nLet me consider the key points. The author is in a relationship and has certain boundaries. The girlfriend has a specific kink or lifestyle choice that he's not comfortable with. The question is whether he's wrong for not wanting to participate in that dynamic.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries and comfort levels. If one person is not into a certain aspect, they can't be forced to participate. The author didn't force the girlfriend to hide her preferences; he just chose not to engage in them. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel rejected because her needs aren't met, but that's a different issue. The author isn't wrong for being honest about his feelings. However, the way he communicated it might have been a problem. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might have felt her identity was being rejected, which is a valid concern. But the author's discomfort is also valid. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent and respect. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be a 'caretaker' if it's not something he's comfortable with. However, the girlfriend's feelings are also important, and they need to find a way to resolve this. The friends suggesting he should try it might not understand the depth of his discomfort. \n\nSo, in terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) framework, the author isn't necessarily the asshole if he's being honest and respectful. However, the situation is complicated because the girlfriend felt that not accepting her kink means he doesn't love her. But the author's stance is about his own comfort, which is a valid reason. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
