It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be a caretaker in a \"little\" dynamic. First, I need to understand what a \"little\" relationship is. From what I remember, it's often part of a dynamic where one person (the \"little\") may engage in age-regressed behavior, and the other (the caretaker) acts as a parental figure. So the girlfriend wants the author to take on a caretaker role, but he's uncomfortable with it.\n\nThe author doesn't judge others who choose this dynamic, but he's not into it himself. He turned her down, and now she's upset, even saying she can't date someone who doesn't accept her. The question is whether he's in the wrong for saying no.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both partners need to be on the same page about their boundaries and desires. The author expressed his discomfort, which is important. But maybe the issue is that the girlfriend felt her needs were being dismissed. If she had previously mentioned this as a significant part of her identity, and he hadn't considered it, that might be different. However, he mentions she hadn't brought it up before, so maybe it was a sudden request.\n\nHe also says he looked up \"little\" and wasn't open-minded, which makes him feel guilty. But it's his right to feel that way and not want to participate in something that makes him uncomfortable. The mutual friends suggested he should try it, but he's still not into it. The core of the issue is whether he's obligated to meet her needs if it's against his own comfort.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems intense\u2014she's upset, says he's an asshole, and implies that not accepting her means not loving her. That's a high-pressure tactic. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries without feeling they have to change for the other. So, if the author is clear that he's not willing to meet this specific need, but the girlfriend sees it as a deal-breaker, then it might be a matter of incompatible needs rather than the author being wrong.\n\nBut maybe the author could have approached the situation with more empathy. He could have listened more, asked her questions to understand why it's important to her, and explored if there's a middle ground. However, he did try to communicate his stance, and if she's unwilling to accept that, it's not entirely his fault. The guilt he's feeling might stem from not being as open-minded as he could be, but ultimately, he's not obligated to participate in something that he finds uncomfortable unless it's a deal-breaker for both.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably that the author isn't in the wrong. He's being honest about his boundaries, even if it leads to the relationship ending. Relationships require mutual agreement, and if one partner can't meet the other's needs in a certain area, it's not necessarily wrong to say no. However, the way he communicated his refusal might be a point of reflection. But based on the information given, he's not the asshole.\n"
