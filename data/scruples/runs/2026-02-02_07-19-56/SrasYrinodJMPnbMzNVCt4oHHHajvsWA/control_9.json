It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants him to be her \"caretaker,\" which he later looks up and finds out is related to being a \"little,\" which I think refers to an adult baby or a relationship where one person acts like a child. The author isn't into that and turned her down, leading to a fight and her not talking to him. He's feeling guilty but also uncomfortable with the idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author says he doesn't judge couples who want that kind of relationship but doesn't want it for himself. The girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not accepting her, which is a big part of her identity. The mutual friends suggest he should try it, but he finds the idea weird. They've been dating a year, and this came up suddenly. She says she can't date someone who doesn't accept her, and he's torn between guilt and his own comfort.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are important. If someone has a significant part of their identity that they want to share, the other partner's willingness to consider it can be a factor. However, being in a relationship also means having boundaries. The author isn't forcing her to do anything, and he's being honest about his discomfort. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel rejected if this is a core part of who she is, and if he's unwilling to engage, it could be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If both partners are supposed to accept each other's needs and boundaries, but in this case, the author's boundary is not to participate. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but it's her right to feel that way. The author isn't being judgmental about others but is stating his own preferences. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's being honest. However, the fact that she feels he's not accepting her could mean that there's a mismatch in their needs. But the author isn't forcing her into anything; he's just not willing to comply. I think the answer would be B, No, because he's not in the wrong for expressing his boundaries, even if it leads to the relationship ending.\n"
