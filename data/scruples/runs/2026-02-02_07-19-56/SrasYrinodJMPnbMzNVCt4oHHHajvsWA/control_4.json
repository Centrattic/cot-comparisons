It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend's request to be a caretaker in a \"little\" relationship. First, I need to understand what a \"little\" relationship entails. From what I know, it's a type of dynamic where one person (the \"little\") wants to role-play as a child, and the other (the \"caretaker\") takes on a parental role. It's part of the DDLG (Daddy Dom/Little Girl) subculture or similar dynamics.\n\nThe author mentions they've been dating for a year, and the girlfriend came out about being a \"little\" recently. The key points here are that the author didn't know about this aspect before and looked it up, finding they don't want any part of it. They turned her down, which led to her not talking to them and feeling hurt. The author is conflicted because they love her but aren't comfortable with the dynamic. Friends suggested trying it, but the author feels weird about it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether turning down the request is the right choice. In relationships, both partners have the right to express their boundaries and preferences. If the girlfriend has specific needs that require the other partner to engage in a certain role, but the other partner isn't comfortable with that, it's their right to say no. However, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014saying she can't date someone who doesn't accept her and calling the author an asshole\u2014might indicate that this is a deal-breaker for her.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary they're not comfortable with. The issue here is mutual compatibility. If one person's needs are non-negotiable and the other can't meet them, it's not necessarily the person who declines the role that's at fault. However, the author could have approached the situation with more open-mindedness, but since they did look it up and still found it uncomfortable, that's a valid stance.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. If she's been into this dynamic for a while and hasn't mentioned it before, maybe she should have communicated earlier. But if this is something that's integral to her identity and she couldn't see the relationship without it, then she's justified in feeling hurt. However, the author isn't obligated to meet her needs if they're outside their comfort zone.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for declining. They have the right to be honest about their boundaries. The problem is a mismatch in their compatibility. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
