It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting him to be her 'caretaker' in a 'little' dynamic. He turned her down because he's not comfortable with treating her like a child, even though he doesn't judge others in similar relationships. Now they're fighting and haven't talked in a while.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend is honest about his feelings and preferences. He's not forcing her to change; instead, he's stating his own boundaries. The girlfriend feels that he can't accept her for who she is, which is a valid concern if compatibility is an issue. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for declining her request.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding of each other's boundaries are important. If both partners can't meet in the middle, it might not be a healthy relationship. The author isn't being judgmental of the lifestyle itself, just stating he's not into it. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, but it's her way of expressing that this is a core part of her identity. \n\nHowever, it's also about personal comfort. If someone isn't into a specific role, they aren't obligated to take it on. The friends suggested he try it, but he feels weirded out just thinking about it. That discomfort is real, and it's his right to prioritize his own feelings. \n\nThe main issue is whether declining a request that's important to the partner makes someone the asshole. It's a matter of whether the author is being disrespectful. He's being honest and not pressuring her, but she feels rejected. It's a tough spot, but if the author is clear and respectful in his communication, he's not wrong for sticking to his boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because he's not in the wrong for not wanting to participate in something he's uncomfortable with, as long as he's respectful and honest. The girlfriend's needs might not align with his, but that doesn't make him the asshole. It's more about compatibility here.\n"
