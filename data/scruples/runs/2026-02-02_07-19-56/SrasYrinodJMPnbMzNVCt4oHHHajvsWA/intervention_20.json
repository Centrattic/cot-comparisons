It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be a 'caretaker' for her in a 'little' relationship dynamic. The author mentions that he found out about this after a year of dating, looked it up, and decided he didn't want to be involved. Now the girlfriend is upset and hasn't spoken to him, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 'little' relationship entails. From what I know, it's part of a dynamic where one person takes on a role that involves age-regression or caregiver/caregiver relationship. The key here is that both parties need to be on the same page and comfortable with the dynamic. The author says he's not into it and feels weirded out even considering it. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not accepting her for who she is. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The main points are mutual consent and open communication in relationships. If one partner's needs or desires are a deal-breaker for the other, it's not necessarily wrong to say no, especially if it's not something they discussed beforehand. However, there's also the aspect of being open-minded and respecting each other's interests, but that doesn't mean you have to participate if it's outside your comfort zone.\n\nThe author didn't know about this aspect of her before, and he's now making a decision based on his discomfort. The girlfriend is frustrated because she felt her authentic self wasn't accepted. But the author isn't rejecting her as a person; he's rejecting a specific role that's not comfortable for him. However, maybe there's a lack of compromise or understanding from both sides. The author could have tried to find a middle ground, but if the thought makes him uncomfortable, it's his right to say no. \n\nIn relationships, both parties have the right to set boundaries. If the author isn't willing to engage in something that's important to her, but she is, that's a conflict in values or needs. However, it's not inherently wrong to have different interests or boundaries as long as they're communicated respectfully. The key is whether the author's refusal is a deal-breaker for the relationship. Since the girlfriend feels this is a fundamental part of her identity, but the author can't accept it, it's a matter of whether they can adjust or if it's too big a divide.\n\nThe friends suggested he try it, but he's not comfortable. That's his choice. The guilt he feels might come from not being open-minded enough, but if it's genuinely something he's not okay with, he's not in the wrong for stating his boundaries. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because he's respecting his own limits and not forcing himself into a role he's uncomfortable with.\n"
