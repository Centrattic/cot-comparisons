It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants him to be her \"caretaker\" in the context of being a \"little,\" which I know from previous knowledge is part of a roleplay or dynamic where one person acts more like a child and the other as a caregiver. The author didn't know about this before and after looking it up, decided he didn't want to participate. Now they're arguing, and the girlfriend is upset, feeling he's rejecting her for who she is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: consent and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is saying he's not comfortable with this dynamic and isn't willing to participate. The girlfriend is arguing that he's not accepting her for who she is. The key here is whether the author is being disrespectful by not accommodating her desires, or if he's within his rights to decline something he's not comfortable with.\n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and preferences. If one partner has a specific kink or dynamic they want, the other isn't obligated to participate unless both agree. The author isn't being closed-minded just because he's not into it; he's honest about his lack of interest. However, the way he communicated his refusal might matter. If he was dismissive or judgmental, that could be an issue. The post mentions he looked it up but felt weird about it, which shows he made an effort to understand, but still decided against it.\n\nThe girlfriend's response seems harsh\u2014calling him an asshole and saying he's rejecting her. That might indicate that she's taking his refusal as rejection of her as a person, which isn't fair if he's respecting her by acknowledging her choice but declining to participate. However, her desire is significant to her, so the author's refusal is indeed a big deal. The mutual friends suggesting he try it might be well-meaning, but if the author genuinely feels uncomfortable, he isn't wrong for not wanting to compromise his own boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author had been aware of her interests before committing and didn't discuss it, he might be wrong. But the context says she brought it up recently, and he didn't know about it before. So he's not hiding his preferences but making a decision based on new information. The guilt he feels might stem from feeling like he's not being supportive, but it's also important to support oneself mentally and emotionally.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to participate in something he's not comfortable with. He's maintaining his boundaries, which is essential in any relationship. The girlfriend's reaction may be extreme, but the author isn't obligated to engage in activities that make him uncomfortable, especially if they were unknown to him prior.\n"
