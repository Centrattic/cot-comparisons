It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting her partner to be a \"caretaker\" in a little role, which the author is uncomfortable with. He turned her down, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the roles mean. The term \"little\" refers to a dynamic where one person takes on a younger, more dependent role, and the other acts as a caretaker or parent figure. The author isn't into that, which is his personal preference. \n\nThe key points here are about consent, mutual respect in relationships, and personal boundaries. In any healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't forcing his partner to do something, and he's being honest about his feelings. However, the girlfriend is upset because she feels he's not accepting her for who she is. \n\nThe author's argument is that he's not comfortable with the role and that he's not in the wrong for not wanting to participate. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees this refusal as not accepting her true self. The question is whether his refusal makes him the asshole.\n\nI should consider the concept of being in the \"wrong\" here. If the author is honest about his boundaries and the girlfriend is aware of them, then perhaps he's not at fault. But if he's being rigid and unwilling to consider any discussion or compromise, that could be seen as a problem. However, the user mentioned that the author isn't open-minded when looking into it, and he feels weirded out even at the thought. So it's not just a matter of not wanting to participate but being genuinely uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, mutual friends suggested trying it, but the author finds it weird. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014saying he's an asshole for not considering it\u2014might indicate that she's not respecting his boundaries. In that case, the author might be justified in setting those boundaries.\n\nBut then again, in a relationship, sometimes we need to try to meet each other's needs. However, that's only if both parties are willing. The author is clearly not willing, and it's his right to state that. The girlfriend is upset because she feels her needs aren't being met, which is also valid. The problem arises when she accuses him of not accepting her, which could be a stretch if the author is being truthful about his feelings.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for stating his boundaries. However, the situation might require more communication. The key is whether the author is being respectful and honest without judgment. Since he mentions not judging others in similar relationships but doesn't want it himself, that's a sign of not being judgmental. Therefore, he's not the asshole.\n"
