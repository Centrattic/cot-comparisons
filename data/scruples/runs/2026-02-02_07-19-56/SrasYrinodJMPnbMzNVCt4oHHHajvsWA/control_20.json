It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend's request to be a 'caretaker' in a 'little' dynamic. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The term 'little' refers to a type of relationship where one person acts as a caretaker for the other, who may engage in childlike behavior. The author didn't know about this before and looked it up, then declined. The girlfriend is upset and says the author isn't accepting her for who she is.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect in relationships. The author isn't into the dynamic the girlfriend wants. The girlfriend is pressuring the author to accept it, even saying that if he loved her, he would. That's a red flag because relationships should be based on mutual agreement, not coercion. \n\nThe author is clear he doesn't want to participate and isn't comfortable. He's not trying to change her or be judgmental, just stating his own boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she's using emotional manipulation (\"if you loved me...\"), which isn't healthy. \n\nThe friends suggested trying it, but the author feels weird. It's important to honor one's own feelings. You can't force someone into a role they're uncomfortable with. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The problem here is the girlfriend's insistence without considering the author's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's being honest about his preferences and not engaging in something that makes him uncomfortable. The issue lies in the girlfriend's reaction and her not respecting his boundaries.\n"
