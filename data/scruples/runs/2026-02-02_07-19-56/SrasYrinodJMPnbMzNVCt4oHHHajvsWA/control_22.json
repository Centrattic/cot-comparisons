It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her \"caretaker\" in a \"little\" dynamic. First, I need to understand what a \"little\" dynamic is. From the context, it sounds like a consensual power exchange where one person takes on a caregiver role, similar to a parent and child. The author didn't know about this before and isn't interested, even after researching.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual understanding, and boundaries. The girlfriend wanted this arrangement, but the author isn't comfortable with it. The question is whether refusing is wrong. The author isn't being mean or abusive; he's honest about his feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but that doesn't make the author's refusal wrong. The friends suggested he try it, but personal discomfort is valid. The bigger issue is whether the author's refusal is a deal-breaker for the relationship. Since both parties need to be on the same page for such arrangements, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate. It's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
