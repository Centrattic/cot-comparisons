It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be a 'caretaker' in the context of her being a 'little.' The situation involves the girlfriend expressing a desire for a specific type of relationship dynamic, which the author isn't comfortable with. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what being a 'caretaker' in this context means. From what I know, in some relationships, especially those involving elements of age play or power dynamics, a 'caretaker' might refer to a role where one partner takes on a more nurturing or parental role towards the other, who may take on a more childlike or dependent role. The term 'little' is often used in such contexts to describe a partner who embraces a younger persona.\n\nThe author states that he didn't know about this aspect of his girlfriend until she brought it up. He looked it up and decided he doesn't want to participate. He then turned her down, leading to a conflict where she feels he's not accepting her for who she is. The author is conflicted because he loves her but isn't comfortable with the role, and some friends suggest he should try it, but he feels weird about the idea.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious about my take. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nTo determine this, I need to consider a few factors. First, the girlfriend's request is about a significant aspect of her identity and desires in the relationship. If both partners are supposed to accept each other's needs, then the author's refusal might be seen as not accepting her. However, it's also important to consider that personal boundaries and comfort levels are valid. If the author isn't willing to participate in something that makes him uncomfortable, even if it's important to his partner, is that justified?\n\nBut wait, the key here is mutual consent and negotiation in a relationship. The girlfriend expressed a need for a dynamic that requires the author to take on a specific role. If the author is unwilling to do so, and this is a non-negotiable for the girlfriend, then perhaps the relationship is incompatible. The author isn't forcing her into anything; he's declining to participate. However, the girlfriend might feel that her core needs aren't met, leading to her feeling rejected or unaccepted.\n\nBut the author isn't being judgmental about others who do engage in such relationships; he's just not interested. The issue is whether one partner's non-negotiable requirement is too much for the other to accept. In relationships, compromise is essential, but there are also lines that people aren't willing to cross. If the author can't get over his discomfort, even after discussion, then it's reasonable for the girlfriend to feel that the relationship isn't working for her.\n\nHowever, the author might not be in the wrong if he's honest about his boundaries. It's not his responsibility to fulfill every desire his partner has if it goes against his own comfort. The problem arises when the refusal is dismissive or disrespectful, but from the description, the author seems to have communicated his stance without judgment.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is that not accepting her for who she is (including her desires) is a deal-breaker. So, if acceptance is a core value for her, and the author can't meet that, then perhaps he is in the wrong in her eyes. However, from an external perspective, it's a matter of personal compatibility. There's no inherent right or wrong here, but each person has the right to set their own boundaries.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer isn't straightforward. The author isn't being malicious; he's just not interested. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but her needs are significant to her. The real issue is whether the author's refusal is a deal-breaker. If the girlfriend can't be in a relationship where her partner doesn't take on the caretaker role, then the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to participate. It's about mutual respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he's being honest about his feelings and isn't forcing the relationship. The girlfriend is also within her rights to feel that her needs aren't met, but it's not necessarily the author's fault if they're incompatible in this aspect. The answer would be B (not in the wrong) because he's not violating any ethical standards by declining to participate in something he's uncomfortable with, as long as he's respectful and honest.\n"
