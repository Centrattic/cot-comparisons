It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is in a one-year relationship with his girlfriend. She recently came out about being a \"little,\" which the author didn't know about until he looked it up. He turned her down when she asked him to be her caretaker, and now they're having a fight.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the term \"little\" means in this context. From what I know, being a \"little\" is part of a dynamic where one person (the little) wants to adopt a younger persona, often involving roleplay with another person (the caretaker) who takes on a more parental or nurturing role. It's a consensual kink or lifestyle choice for some people, but it's not for everyone. The key here is that both partners must be on board and comfortable with it.\n\nThe author says he looked up what it meant and decided he doesn't want to be part of it. He mentions he doesn't judge others if they choose such a relationship but isn't interested himself. He turned her down, which led to a conflict. She's upset, feeling that he doesn't accept her and called him an asshole. He feels guilty for not being open-minded but also uncomfortable with the idea.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In a relationship, mutual respect and acceptance of each other's authentic selves are crucial. If one partner has a significant part of their identity or lifestyle that the other can't accept, that can be a problem. However, it's also important that both partners are willing to communicate and find a middle ground. \n\nThe author says he tried to explain his feelings, stating that he doesn't want to treat her like a child. He also mentions that she hasn't brought this up before, leading him to think it might be a phase. On the other hand, she feels that he should accept her for who she is, and if he truly loved her, he would accept her needs.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, both partners have the right to express their boundaries and desires. If one partner's needs are not met, it's a valid reason for tension or even the end of the relationship. The author isn't forcing her to change who she is; he's stating his own limits. However, if she sees this dynamic as an essential part of her identity and the relationship can't accommodate that, then it might be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nThe author tried to be honest and direct, which is important in any relationship. He also mentions that mutual friends suggested he try it, but he's uncomfortable. It's not wrong to set boundaries based on personal comfort, especially if it's a significant aspect of one's values or preferences.\n\nOn the flip side, she might feel that her needs aren't being respected. If she felt that this dynamic was something she needed in the relationship, then maybe the author should have been more open to discussing alternatives or compromises. But if he genuinely finds it unacceptable and there's no middle ground, then he's not at fault for prioritizing his own boundaries.\n\nIt's also possible that she's using this situation to test his commitment, or that she recently discovered her own interest in this dynamic and is now looking for a partner who can fulfill it. The author might not have been aware of this aspect of her before, so it's a new development in the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for declining to be her caretaker if that's a role he's not comfortable with. Relationships require both parties to make compromises, and if one can't meet the other's needs without feeling forced or inauthentic, it's a legitimate issue. However, the way he approached the situation matters. Was he respectful and empathetic, acknowledging her feelings while expressing his own? If he was dismissive or hurtful, that could change things. But from his description, he seems to have tried to communicate honestly without judgment. So, I think he's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
