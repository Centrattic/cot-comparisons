It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with his girlfriend. She recently came out about being into being a \"little,\" which he didn't know about until he looked it up. He turned her down when she asked him to be her caretaker, and now they're fighting. She's upset and claims he's being an asshole for not accepting her. The author feels guilty but also uncomfortable with the idea. His friends suggested he try it, but he's not into it. He's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should understand what being a \"little\" and having a caretaker entails. From what I know, in some contexts, being a \"little\" refers to a relationship dynamic where one person (the little) acts like a child and the other (the caretaker) acts like a parent. This is part of a consensual power dynamic, often part of a lifestyle or kink. It's important that both parties consent and are comfortable with the role.\n\nNow, the author was not aware of this aspect of his girlfriend's preferences. When she came out about it, he did some research and decided he wasn't interested. He turned her down, which led to a conflict. She's now upset, feeling that he can't accept her for who she is, while the author is struggling with the idea of engaging in something that makes him uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The girlfriend expressed a desire that the author isn't willing to fulfill. Does that make him the asshole? Well, if the dynamic is consensual and part of her identity, then the author's refusal might be seen as a deal-breaker. However, if the author isn't into it and it's not part of his identity, he's not obligated to participate. Relationships require mutual understanding, and if one partner can't meet the other's needs, that can be a problem. But it's also about personal boundaries and not being forced into something that makes you uncomfortable.\n\nThe author isn't judging others who are into it, which is good. He's honest about his feelings. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is pushing him to accept something he's not comfortable with, possibly using emotional pressure by saying he can't love her if he doesn't comply. That could be a red flag. However, if this dynamic is a core part of her happiness in a relationship, then the author might need to consider if they're compatible long-term.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he communicated his feelings honestly and respectfully, even if she's upset, he's not at fault. However, if he was dismissive or didn't listen to her perspective, that could be an issue. The author mentions he looked it up and decided he didn't want to be involved, which shows he made an informed decision. He also states he's not closed-minded in general, which is a good sign. His friends' advice to try it might add another layer, but the author's discomfort is valid. \n\nIn consensual non-consensual relationships, both parties must agree. If the author isn't willing to participate, then the relationship might need to be reevaluated. But the author isn't wrong for holding to his boundaries. The girlfriend is within her right to feel upset if this is a deal-breaker for her. However, the author isn't in the wrong for not accepting something that's outside his comfort zone, as long as he's respectful and honest.\n"
