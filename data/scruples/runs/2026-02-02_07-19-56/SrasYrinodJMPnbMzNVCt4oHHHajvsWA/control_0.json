It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for turning down being a caretaker for their girlfriend in a \"little\" dynamic. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has been dating their girlfriend for a year, and she recently came out about wanting a \"little\" dynamic. The author looked it up, decided they didn't want to be part of it, and turned her down. Now she's upset and hasn't talked to them in a while.\n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and personal comfort. The author isn't judging others who want this kind of relationship, but they're clear that they don't want it for themselves. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels that the author doesn't accept her for who she is, which is a valid concern because acceptance is important in a relationship.\n\nBut the author is also expressing that they're uncomfortable and that the thought of trying it makes them weirded out. The question is whether it's wrong to say no. In relationships, both partners need to have their boundaries respected. It's not the author's responsibility to pretend they're okay with something that makes them uncomfortable, especially if they've never been into it. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's reaction is also significant. She's saying that if he loved her, he would accept her, which can create pressure. But love should mean accepting someone's boundaries as well. The author isn't rejecting her as a person; they're rejecting a specific role they aren't comfortable with. \n\nThe friends suggesting he try it might not consider his feelings, so his discomfort is valid. The author's guilt might come from feeling like they're not being open-minded, but it's also okay to have personal limits. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they're being honest about their discomfort and aren't willing to compromise their own feelings. The issue might be more about compatibility in this aspect rather than one person being wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
