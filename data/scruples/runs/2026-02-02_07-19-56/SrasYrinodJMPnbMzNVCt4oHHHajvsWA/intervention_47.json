It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after turning down his girlfriend's request to be in a \"little\" relationship, which involves one person acting as a caretaker for the other.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"little\" relationship entails. From what I know, it's a type of dynamic where one partner takes on a more childlike role, and the other acts as a caretaker or parent-like figure. This is part of the broader kink or fetish community, but not everyone is into that. The key here is mutual consent and comfort.\n\nThe author didn't know about this aspect of his girlfriend's interests before she brought it up. He did some research and decided he wasn't comfortable with it. He turned her down, and now she's upset, saying he's an asshole for not accepting her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering relationship ethics, the main points are: consent, communication, and mutual respect. The author communicated his feelings clearly, right? He told her he wasn't interested and didn't want to pretend she was a child. He's not trying to control her or make her stop being who she is, just not participating in the dynamic she wants.\n\nOn the other hand, she feels that if he loves her, he should accept this part of her. But that's a tricky point. While acceptance is important in a relationship, it's also about mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If one person is uncomfortable with a specific aspect of the other's lifestyle or preferences, they aren't obligated to comply, especially if it's a fundamental part of their identity that they're not okay with.\n\nThe author didn't force her into this; she initiated the discussion. He made his feelings clear, and she's now upset. The friends suggested he should try it, but that's not necessarily right. People should be able to set their boundaries without being labeled as assholes. It's possible that the girlfriend is conflating acceptance with acceptance of all her desires, but consent and comfort are crucial. If he's not comfortable, he's not in the wrong for saying no.\n\nHowever, maybe the problem is that he didn't try to understand her perspective more, but he did look it up and still felt uncomfortable. So he's not being closed-minded. The guilt he feels might be because he's not accepting something she wants, but if it's against his values or makes him uncomfortable, it's not his fault.\n\nIn summary, the author clearly communicated his boundaries, and the girlfriend is upset because she feels unaccepted. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's limits. Since he's not forcing her to stop what she likes, just not participating, he's not in the wrong.\n"
