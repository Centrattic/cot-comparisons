It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants the guy to be her \"caretaker\" in a \"little\" dynamic, which the guy doesn't feel comfortable with. He turned her down, and now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what \"little\" and \"caretaker\" mean in this context. From what I know, being a \"little\" in the context of relationships usually refers to a dynamic where one person acts in a childlike manner, often part of a dominance/submission relationship. The caretaker would be the one who acts as a parent figure. So, the guy is being asked to take on a parent-like role towards his girlfriend, which he's not interested in.\n\nThe guy says he looked it up after she came out about it and found it unappealing. He turned her down because he doesn't want to treat her like a kid. He also mentions that she's never brought it up before, so he thinks it might be a phase. The girlfriend is upset, saying she can't date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that he's an asshole for not considering it. The guy is feeling guilty and friends are telling him to try it, but he's uncomfortable.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about consent, mutual respect, and the nature of their relationship. The question is whether the guy was wrong to decline a role he's not comfortable with, even if it's important to his girlfriend.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable expressing their boundaries and preferences. The guy is honest about his feelings and isn't trying to force himself into a role he's uncomfortable with. However, the girlfriend might feel rejected or that her needs aren't being considered. The problem here is whether the guy's refusal is a deal-breaker for her, which seems to be the case.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is curious for an opinion. I need to consider if refusing to participate in a partner's kink or preference is inherently wrong. The answer likely depends on whether the refusal is due to judgment or personal disinterest versus a lack of respect. The guy states he doesn't judge others for choosing such relationships but isn't into it himself. That's a key point\u2014he's not condemning her, just stating his own limits.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to meet in the middle, but there are limits. If a core part of someone's identity or desires isn't compatible with their partner's, it can lead to conflict. The girlfriend is saying that this issue is a deal-breaker for her, which the guy now realizes. He feels guilty because he didn't consider that this might be a significant part of her identity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship requires mutual acceptance of each other's non-negotiables, and the girlfriend's non-negotiable is that he accepts this dynamic, then the guy's refusal would break that mutual acceptance. However, if the guy's comfort and boundaries are also non-negotiable, then he's not in the wrong. It's a matter of whether both partners can accept each other's limits.\n\nThe guy is honest and clear about his stance. He didn't force her or mock her, just said he's not into it. If the girlfriend can't accept that, maybe it's a sign that the relationship isn't compatible. But if the guy is causing her emotional distress by not considering her needs, that could be a problem. The friends advising him to try it might be pushing him to be more open, but if he's genuinely uncomfortable, he's not obligated to comply.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for setting his boundaries. It's not his fault that their values or desires in the relationship don't align in this specific way. However, the situation is complicated because it's causing a rift. The answer would be that he's not the asshole because he's being honest and respecting his own boundaries, even if the relationship can't continue.\n"
