It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting to be a 'little' and the boyfriend not wanting to be a caretaker in that dynamic. The writer turned her down, and now they're not talking. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The term 'little' here likely refers to a caretaker/little (C/l) relationship, where one partner takes on more of a nurturing role. The author says they looked up what it meant and decided they don't want to participate. The girlfriend is upset, saying he's an asshole for not considering it.\n\nThe key points to consider: mutual consent and comfort in a relationship. The author isn't into C/l dynamics and isn't comfortable with the idea. The girlfriend feels rejected and says he doesn't accept her. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in something he's not comfortable with. Relationships require both parties to agree on terms. If one person isn't into it, they have the right to say no. The friends advising him to try it might not consider his discomfort. However, the author could have approached the situation more sensitively, maybe explaining why it's not for him. But ultimately, being in a relationship shouldn't force someone into a role they're not okay with. The girlfriend might need to realize that her needs in this aspect aren't met here, even if they're in love. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
