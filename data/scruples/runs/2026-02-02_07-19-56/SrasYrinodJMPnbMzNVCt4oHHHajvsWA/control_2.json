It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down their girlfriend's request to be a 'caretaker' in a 'little' dynamic. First, I need to understand the context. The author dates their girlfriend for a year, and she comes out as being into being a 'little,' which involves a caretaker role. The author looked it up and decided they don't want to participate. They turned her down, leading to a fight and her not talking to them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole here. Let's break it down. The key points are: mutual respect in relationships, consent, personal boundaries, and communication. The author isn't judging others who choose such a lifestyle but personally doesn't want it. They communicated their feelings, even if it made the girlfriend upset. The girlfriend feels rejected because she believes the author isn't accepting her for who she is, and she sees the refusal as a lack of love. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to be okay with the other's preferences, but it's also about personal comfort. If the author is uncomfortable with the idea, they aren't obligated to comply. However, the way they handled it might matter. Did they communicate their feelings respectfully? The user says they turned her down directly, leading to a fight. The girlfriend's reaction is strong\u2014she calls the author an asshole and claims they don't accept her. \n\nThe author might be in the right if they clearly communicated their boundaries and aren't willing to compromise on something they're uncomfortable with. However, if the refusal was abrupt without trying to understand her perspective, maybe there's room for improvement. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't the asshole if they're honest about their feelings and not forcing the relationship into something they can't be part of. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about her needing to accept that the author can't meet her needs in that specific way. \n\nAlso, considering mutual friends suggesting trying it, but the author feels weird. That shows they considered others' opinions but still stand by their comfort. So, the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
