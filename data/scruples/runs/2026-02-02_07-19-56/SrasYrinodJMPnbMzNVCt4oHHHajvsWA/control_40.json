It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants the guy to be her \"caretaker\" in a 'little' dynamic, which he's not comfortable with. He turned her down, and now they're in a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what a 'little' dynamic entails. From what I remember, it's a type of relationship where one person (the 'little') acts like a child, and the other (the caretaker) takes on a parental role. It's a consensual power exchange, part of the broader kink or fetish community. The key here is consent and mutual agreement.\n\nThe author says he's not into it, doesn't want to treat his girlfriend like a kid, and feels it's a phase. The girlfriend, on the other hand, feels he's not accepting her, leading to a breakup. The mutual friends suggest he should try it, but he's uncomfortable even considering it.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries and desires. If the girlfriend's identity or needs involve something the other isn't willing to engage with, it can create a conflict. But it's also important that the author isn't pressured into something he's not comfortable with. The girlfriend's statement that he's an asshole for not considering it and that he should accept it if he loves her might be problematic. That sounds like emotional manipulation, suggesting that he should compromise his own boundaries for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be dismissive if he's not even open-minded about it. However, he mentions he looked it up and isn't interested. It's his right to set boundaries. The key is mutual respect. If the girlfriend can't accept his refusal, maybe the relationship isn't compatible. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in something he's not comfortable with, especially if it's not a prior known aspect of her. The girlfriend's reaction seems more extreme, possibly unrealistic expectations. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
