It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her 'caretaker' in a 'littles' dynamic. First, I need to understand what the situation is.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been dating for a year. She recently came out as a 'little', which he looked up and decided he doesn't want to be involved in. He turned her down, and now she's upset, not talking to him. They had a fight where she felt he wasn't accepting her, while he's uncomfortable with the role of a caretaker, treating her like a kid. Friends suggested he try it, but he's still uncomfortable.\n\nThe question is whether he's the asshole here. The key points are: mutual respect in relationships, boundaries, and communication. The author isn't judging others for this dynamic but isn't into it himself. He's honest about not wanting to participate, which is important. She feels he's not accepting her, but if the author isn't comfortable, it's his right to set boundaries. However, relationships require compromise. If she sees this as a deal-breaker and he doesn't, maybe they need to part ways. The guilt might be because he didn't explore it more, but if it genuinely makes him uncomfortable, he's not obligated to comply. So, is he wrong? Probably not, because he's being honest about his limits. But maybe the way he handled it could be improved, like discussing it earlier. However, the core issue is his right to set boundaries. Answer B.\n"
