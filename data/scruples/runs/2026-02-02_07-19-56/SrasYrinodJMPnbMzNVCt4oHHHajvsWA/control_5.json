It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her \"caretaker\" in a \"little\" relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been dating for a year, and it's been smooth until she brought up this new aspect of her identity. He didn't know about the \"little\" dynamic until he looked it up, and he's decided he doesn't want to participate. He turned her down, which led to a conflict where she hasn't spoken to him since. She feels he doesn't accept her, while he feels uncomfortable and unsure if this is a phase. Friends have suggested he try it, but he's not comfortable.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship. In consensual relationships, both partners should have the right to set their own boundaries without feeling guilty. The author is not in the wrong if he's honest about his discomfort and isn't pressuring her to change who she is. However, the situation could also imply that the girlfriend has certain expectations that the author isn't meeting, which might be a deal-breaker for her.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are: \n1. Did he handle the situation respectfully? He did turn her down after understanding what it entailed, which is a valid right.\n2. Was he open-minded? He looked it up, so that's a positive step. He's not forcing her to change, but he's clear about his boundaries.\n3. Is refusing to participate inherently wrong? No, because relationships require mutual consent and comfort. Neither partner should be forced into something they're not okay with.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. If she's using the relationship as a test of acceptance, that could be an issue. But the author's stance is about his own comfort, which is his right. However, the fact that this is a significant deal for her might mean that the relationship can't continue if this is non-negotiable for her. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" question, it's about whether he's being unreasonable. Since he's not judging her but stating his own limits, he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend is also not in the wrong for needing this, but if it's a non-starter for him, it's a compatibility issue. The answer would be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's communicating his boundaries and not pressuring her to change."
