It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down his girlfriend's request to be her \"caretaker\" in a \"little\" dynamic. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"little\" dynamic entails. From what I know, it's a type of roleplay where one person (the \"little\") acts younger or more childlike, and the other (the \"caretaker\") takes on a parental or nurturing role. It's consensual and part of their kink or preference.\n\nThe author says he found out about her being a \"little\" and looked it up, but doesn't want any part of it. He turned her down, which led to a fight and her not talking to him. He's feeling guilty but also uncomfortable. His friends suggested he should at least try it, but he's not into it and feels weird even considering it. He loves her but doesn't want to do something he's not comfortable with.\n\nNow, the key points here. In a relationship, both partners should be able to express their needs and boundaries. The girlfriend expected him to accept her as she is, which includes her kink. The author is clear that he doesn't want to participate, which is his right. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not accommodating her preference. \n\nConsent and mutual agreement are essential in any relationship. If one partner has a specific kink that the other isn't willing to engage in, it's not the other's fault for not wanting to participate. However, it's important to communicate and find a compromise. But if the kink is a non-negotiable for one partner and the other can't comply, it might lead to incompatibility. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014saying he's an asshole for not considering it and that he can't accept her\u2014suggests that she sees this as a deal-breaker. If she can't be with someone who isn't into her kink, then maybe the issue is about her needs not being met, not necessarily the author being in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't pressuring her to change her preferences either. He's honest about his boundaries. The problem arises when one person's needs are so critical that the other can't meet them. In that case, the relationship might not be sustainable, but that doesn't mean either is the \"asshole.\" \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to participate in something he's uncomfortable with. The responsibility isn't solely on him to change. If the girlfriend can't accept his boundaries, that's her issue, but it's a mutual problem. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
