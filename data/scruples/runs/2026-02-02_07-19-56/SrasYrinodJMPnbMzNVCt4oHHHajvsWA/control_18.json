It's been smooth but yesterday she came out about being a 'little'. I had no idea what it was about until I looked it up and I want absolutly no part in it. I don't judge couples if both of them want a relationship like that, but I really don't want it for myself\n\nI turned her down when she asked me to be her 'caretaker' or something, and now she hasn't talked to me in a while. I really dont feel comfortable with treating my girlfriend like a little kid, and part of me thinks this is a phase because she'a never really brought this up before.\n\nShe said she didn't think she could date someone who doesn't accept her for who she is, and that I'm an asshole for not even considering it. We kind of fought for a little bit, me saying that I'm not into that sort of thing and her saying that if I loved her I would accept it. This whole ordeal is stressful and weird because I've never seen her act like this, but I also can't help but feel guilty since I wasn't exactly open minded when I looked it up. I've talked with some mutual friends and they've said that I should at least try it, but even the thought makes me just weirded out. I love this girl but I really don't want to do something that I'm completely not comfortable with. It seems like a really big deal to her.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for turning her down?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the girlfriend wanting to be a \"little,\" which I think refers to a \"little\" relationship where one partner (the caretaker) takes on a more nurturing role. The author isn't into it and turned her down. Now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in relationships. Both partners should be comfortable with the terms of their relationship. The author isn't interested in this dynamic, so he's being honest about his preferences. That seems fair. He doesn't judge others but isn't willing to participate, which is his right.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend feels that he's not accepting her for who she is. If someone's identity or needs are part of who they are, refusing to accommodate that might be a problem. However, if this is a recent development for her and not a core part of her identity, maybe it's more of a preference she's exploring now. The user mentions she hasn't brought it up before, so maybe it's a new phase. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being disrespectful. He's not trying to change her but is stating his own boundaries. It's possible that the girlfriend feels rejected because her needs aren't being met. But in relationships, both people have to compromise. If one person isn't comfortable with a significant aspect, it might be a deal-breaker. \n\nAlso, the friends advised him to try it, but he's genuinely uncomfortable. It's important not to force someone into something they find weird or unacceptable. Emotional pressure from a partner to change can be an issue, but so can being forced into a dynamic that goes against one's values or comfort.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being honest about his boundaries. However, the way he communicated his refusal might matter. Was it respectful? Did he listen to her feelings? The scenario says he explained his reasons and they had a fight. It's possible that both sides have valid points, but the author isn't obligated to participate in something he finds uncomfortable. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for declining, as long as he's being truthful and respectful about his limits.\n"
