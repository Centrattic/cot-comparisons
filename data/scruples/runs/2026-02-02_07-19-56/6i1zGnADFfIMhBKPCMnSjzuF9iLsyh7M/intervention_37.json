In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister against returning to work after giving birth. The author tried to explain their perspective, emphasizing the importance of being present for the child's milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister took offense, calling the author condescending and telling them to butt out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and sister are close, so the advice was given with good intentions. However, even well-intentioned advice can come across as condescending if not delivered carefully. The author might not have considered that their sister's decision could be based on different values or circumstances. For example, maybe the parents are both working to provide a better life, or they have a trusted daycare setup. The author's assumption that their sister will regret her choice is a strong statement and could be dismissive of her own reasoning.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction suggests that the advice was unwelcome, which is important. Even if the author believes they're right, pushing their views without respecting boundaries can be seen as overstepping. The key point is whether the author had the right to give this advice in the first place. While it's natural to want to help, the sister's autonomy in making decisions about her family is significant. The author might be projecting their own values without considering that their sister has her own priorities and reasons.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were good, the way the advice was given and the strong assertion that the sister will regret her choice could be seen as judgmental. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because they may have overstepped by being condescending and not respecting their sister's choice.\n"
