In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The sister ended up being upset, calling the advice condescending.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to share their own positive experience of staying home with their kids. They tried to explain the benefits and the emotional aspects, like missing milestones. But the sister didn't appreciate it, feeling that the author was being condescending. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. In situations like this, it's important to consider the context. Family advice can be well-meaning but might come across as judgmental if not delivered carefully. The key points here are the method of delivery and the relationship dynamics. The author mentions that they and their sister have been close, so the sister might have felt the advice was overstepping, even if it was from a good place. \n\nAlso, the author assumes the sister will regret her decision. That's pretty strong language. Advising someone else's parenting choices can be sensitive, especially when it's framed as a prediction of regret. The sister might have felt her decision was being invalidated, even though she and her husband can afford to have her work. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because their intention was to offer support based on their own experience. However, the way the advice was given could have been more empathetic. It's possible that the sister needed support for her choice rather than being told it's a mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that they're sharing a valid viewpoint, and it's up to the sister to decide. But in close relationships, even well-intentioned advice can cause hurt if it's not respectful of the other person's autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as coming from a good place but delivered in a way that was too forceful or condescending, which could make them in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
