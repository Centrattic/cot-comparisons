In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author advising their sister against returning to work after giving birth, suggesting that she should stay home with the baby since they can afford it. The sister reacted negatively, saying the author was condescending, and the author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister and her husband can financially support her staying home, so there's no necessity for her to return to work. The author's intention was to share their own positive experience of staying home and the emotional benefits they felt. However, the sister felt condescended to, which is a key point here.\n\nIn many cultures, there's a lot of debate about whether it's better for a parent to stay home or work. Different families have different priorities and values. The author is coming from a place of personal experience, trying to share what they believe is the better choice. However, even if their intention is good, the sister might feel that her personal choice is being dismissed or criticized. \n\nThe term \"AITA\" often hinges on respect for others' autonomy and boundaries. The sister might feel that her decision is personal, and even though the author is a well-meaning sibling, she might not want unsolicited advice. The author might be overstepping by implying that their way is the only correct way, leading to the sister feeling judged. \n\nAlso, the sister's reaction of telling them to \"butt out\" suggests that she felt her autonomy was being invaded. The author might not have considered that their sister has her own reasons for returning to work, which could include personal fulfillment, financial reasons (even if they can afford it, maybe she wants to work for other reasons), or other factors. The author's advice, while well-intentioned, may not take into account the sister's individual circumstances and choices.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were good, the action of giving unsolicited advice in a way that the sister perceived as condescending could be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is respecting the sister's right to make her own decisions without pressure, even if the author disagrees. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's autonomy despite their good intentions.\n"
