In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to return to work after giving birth.\n\nFirst, the author stayed home with their kids for a year and values that time. They tried to share their experience with their sister, emphasizing the emotional benefits of being present for the child's milestones. The sister, however, reacted negatively, feeling condescended to.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and intent. The author is concerned that their advice, given from a place of personal experience, is valid. But the sister felt it was intrusive. The author's approach might have come off as judgmental, especially using phrases like \"she will regret\" and questioning the daycare choice. Even though the author's intention was to help, the delivery could have been perceived as condescending.\n\nAlso, the sister made a different choice based on her own circumstances. The author might not have considered that their sister's reasons for returning to work (like financial needs, family support, or personal circumstances) could be valid. Everyone's situation is different. The author's advice, while well-meaning, might have dismissed the sister's autonomy in making her own decisions regarding her family.\n\nSo, the question is whether giving advice in this context, especially when it leads to conflict and perceived condescension, is wrong. Since the sister felt belittled and the author didn't account for her different situation, it's possible the author overstepped. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's choice and approached it in a way that caused hurt feelings.\n"
