In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister to stay home with her baby instead of going back to work. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who had their own kids and stayed home for the first year, gave advice about the value of time with the child. The sister took offense, saying the author is condescending. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, family dynamics can be tricky. The author's intention was to share their experience and advice, which might be well-meaning, but the sister felt it was intrusive. The key here is whether giving advice without being asked is condescending. Even if the advice comes from a good place, it can come across as judgmental, especially if the sister feels her choice is valid. The author assumes the sister will regret her decision, which might not be fair. People have different priorities\u2014maybe the sister wants to return to work for financial, career, or personal reasons. The author is projecting their own experience onto their sister, which isn't necessarily wrong, but it's important to respect others' choices.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that someone has to work, but the sister's husband can support her. However, maybe the sister and her husband made a joint decision based on their needs. The author's advice could be seen as undermining their choice. Even if the advice is based on their own positive experience, it's not the same for everyone. The sister might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. So, while the author's intentions are good, the way the advice was given might have been condescending, leading to the sister feeling judged. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's decision without sufficient discussion or understanding of her reasons.\n"
