In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about returning to work after childbirth. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who stayed home with their own kids for a year, gave advice about missing milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister felt condescended to and told the author to butt out.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to share their own experience and express concern. But the sister didn't appreciate the advice and felt it was intrusive. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nI need to consider the context. Family dynamics are tricky. Offering advice based on personal experience isn't inherently wrong, but the delivery might matter. The author might have been too pushy or not considered that their sister's situation is different. The key points are: the sister can afford to stay home, so she's making a choice. The author's advice could be seen as judgmental, especially if it's framed as knowing what's best. The sister's right to make her own decision is important here. Even if the author meant well, the sister felt disrespected. The author might not be in the wrong for giving advice, but the way it was given could be problematic. However, the core issue is whether the author has the right to give that advice. Since it's family, giving advice isn't wrong, but respecting the sister's choice is crucial. The author might be in the wrong if they crossed into being condescending, but if they honestly meant to help and the sister misinterpreted, it's a gray area. The answer hinges on whether the advice was given in a supportive way versus being judgmental. From the description, the author's tone might have been too heavy-handed. So, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy despite their good intentions.\n"
