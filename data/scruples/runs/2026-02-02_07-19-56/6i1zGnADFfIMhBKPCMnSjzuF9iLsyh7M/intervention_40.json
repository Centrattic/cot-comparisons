In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author advised their sister not to go back to work after childbirth, sharing their personal experience of staying home with their kids. The sister didn't take the advice well, feeling condescended to. The author is questioning if they were wrong to give that advice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between siblings. Family members often give advice based on their own experiences, but it's important to respect others' choices. The author's intention was to share their perspective, which is valid, but the sister might have felt pressured or judged. The key here is whether the advice was given in a way that was respectful and considerate of the sister's situation.\n\nThe author mentions that their sister has the financial means to choose either option, so the decision isn't purely based on necessity. The sister's husband is supporting her, so maybe she's making a different choice for personal or professional reasons. The author's concern is about missing out on milestones, but the sister might have different priorities or believe that working is important for her well-being or family's future.\n\nThe line where the author says they know the sister will regret it could come off as judgmental. It's one thing to share personal experiences and another to assert that someone else's decision is wrong. The sister's reaction suggests she felt the advice was condescending, which might be because the author assumed their way was better without acknowledging other valid perspectives.\n\nAlso, every parent has different values and circumstances. What works for one might not work for another. The author might have overstepped by implying that their choice is the only correct one. Even though the advice was well-meaning, the delivery could have been more empathetic, allowing the sister to make her own decision without guilt or pressure.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about the approach. Giving advice isn't inherently wrong, but how it's given matters. If it's done in a way that's dismissive of the other person's autonomy and choices, then it could be problematic. The author's insistence that their sister will regret her choice, despite her having the financial support, shows a lack of respect for her decision.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they crossed a boundary by being judgmental and not respecting their sister's choice, even if their intentions were good.\n"
