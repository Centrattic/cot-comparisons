In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister against returning to work so soon after childbirth. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and is planning to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to explain the benefits of staying home, mentioning milestones and the joy of watching the child grow. The sister got defensive, called the author condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author and sister are close, so giving advice is part of their relationship. The author has personal experience, having stayed home with their kids. They mention the sister's husband can support her financially, so the decision is more about personal choice rather than necessity. \n\nIs it wrong to give advice? Well, the author shares their perspective, which is valid based on their own experience. But the sister might feel that her choice is being judged. The key here is whether the advice was given in a condescending manner. The author says they don't think they were condescending, but the sister felt that way. The way the advice was delivered matters. If it came off as judgmental, even if the intent was to help, it could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, every parent has different priorities. Some may choose to work for personal reasons, career, or financial stability. The author's assumption that the sister will regret her choice might not hold true. It's possible to respect the sister's decision without implying she's making a mistake. The author might have a right to share their opinion, but they need to respect the sister's autonomy in making her own choices for her family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the sister has the right to make her own decisions, even if they differ from the author's, the author might be overstepping by insisting their way is better. The sister's reaction suggests that the advice was not well-received, possibly because it was framed as a criticism rather than a suggestion. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's choice and for the tone of the advice.\n"
