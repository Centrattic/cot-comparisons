In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The sister took offense, calling the author condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author stayed home with their kids for the first year and feels strongly about the benefits of that time. They tried to share their perspective with their sister, emphasizing the emotional and developmental aspects. But the sister didn't appreciate the advice and felt it was intrusive.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. Even though the author's intentions might be good, giving advice on such a personal decision can come off as judgmental. The sister chose to use daycare, which is a valid choice given their financial situation. The author's sister might feel that her decision is being criticized, which can lead to defensiveness.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they don't think there's anything condescending about sharing their views. However, the term \"condescending\" is part of the sister's reaction, so the author might not have communicated their advice in a way that was respectful of their sister's autonomy. Everyone has different circumstances and values, and it's important to acknowledge that without imposing one's own beliefs.\n\nAnother angle is the right to make personal choices. The sister has the right to choose her own path regarding work and childcare. The author's advice, while coming from a place of caring, might have disregarded that choice, leading to the conflict. The author might not be wrong in wanting to share their experience, but the way they did it could have been inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the advice might have been delivered in a way that overstepped boundaries, making them at least partially in the wrong. So, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
