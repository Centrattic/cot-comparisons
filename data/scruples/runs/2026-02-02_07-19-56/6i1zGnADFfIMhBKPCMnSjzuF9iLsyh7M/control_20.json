In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The sister chose to use daycare starting at six weeks, and the author expressed their opinion that their sister will regret missing those early milestones.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is close to their sister and has given her advice based on their own experience. They mention they stayed home with their kids for the first year. The sister, on the other hand, has financial support to return to work. The key points are about the author's intention and the sister's reaction.\n\nThe author's advice was about the emotional value of being present for the child's early development. They might believe that staying home is better for bonding and meeting milestones. However, the sister felt that the advice was condescending and overstepping. The author might not realize that their sister has different priorities or circumstances. Maybe the sister values her career, needs the income, or feels that daycare is a better option for her family. The author's assumption that staying home is the best choice for everyone could be dismissive of the sister's individual situation and choices.\n\nAlso, the tone of the advice might have been perceived as judgmental. Even if the author's intentions were good, the way they framed the advice\u2014emphasizing that the sister will \"regret\" her decision\u2014could come across as presumptuous. Everyone's situation is different, and while the author shares their own experience, they don't get to dictate what's best for their sister's family. The sister's right to make her own decision, even if it's different from the author's, is important. So, the author might be overstepping by implying that their way is the only right way. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't respect the sister's autonomy and choices, even if their intentions were good.\n"
