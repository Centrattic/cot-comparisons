In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after having a baby. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the sister's perspective: She's close to her sister and gave advice based on her own experience of staying home with her kids. She mentions the emotional benefits of being there for milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister didn't take the advice well, calling the author condescending and telling them to butt out.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intentions seem good\u2014they care about their sister and want to share their positive experience. But the sister felt it was condescending. Even if the advice is well-meaning, the way it's delivered can matter. Was the author overstepping? They tried to convince their sister about how she'll regret it, which might come across as judgmental. Everyone's situation is different; even though the sister can afford to stay home, personal choices about work and childcare vary. The author might be projecting their own values onto their sister without considering different priorities, like career or financial independence.\n\nAlso, the sister's response\u2014feeling condescended to\u2014suggests the advice wasn't framed in a supportive way. Maybe the author didn't consider that their sister might have valid reasons for returning to work, like wanting to maintain her career or personal fulfillment. The author's belief that staying home is better for the child might not account for the sister's personal circumstances or desires.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, giving advice is fine, but when it's given in a way that's critical or prescriptive, it can feel intrusive. The sister might need to make her own decision without feeling judged. So while the author's intentions were to help, the execution might have been flawed, leading to the conflict. So, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they overstepped and didn't consider their sister's autonomy and different perspective.\n"
