In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth and instead stay home with the baby. The sister took offense, saying the advice was condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The sister and the author have been close, so the author probably meant well. But the sister didn't take the advice well. The author's reasoning is based on their own experience of staying home with their kids and the value they placed on that time. However, every parent has different priorities and circumstances.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author's intention was to share their perspective, but the sister felt condescended to. Even if the advice was given from a good place, the way it was delivered might have been seen as judgmental. The author mentions that they know the sister will regret it, which could come off as lecturing rather than open dialogue.\n\nAlso, the sister's decision might be based on her own values, job satisfaction, or financial considerations. The author assumes that staying home is the better choice for everyone, but that's not necessarily the case. The author's right to give advice isn't wrong, but pushing their own views as superior might be. The sister's right to make her own decision without being judged is important here.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in wanting to share their experience, the way they did it might have been condescending, leading to the sister's reaction. The question is whether the author overstepped. Since the sister felt the advice was condescending, even if the author didn't mean to be, the impact is what matters. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy and for the condescending tone.\n"
