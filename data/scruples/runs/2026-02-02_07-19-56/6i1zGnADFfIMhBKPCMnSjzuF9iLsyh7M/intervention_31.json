In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister she'll regret going back to work. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is close to their sister and has given advice before. They stayed home with their kids for the first year, and now they're advising the sister to do the same, given the financial ability. The sister took offense, called the author condescending and told them to butt out.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and the nature of the advice. The author's intention might be to share their own positive experience, but the sister feels criticized. Even if the author's advice is well-meaning, giving unsolicited advice can come off as condescending, especially when the sister made her own choice. The author might not realize that their sister has different priorities or circumstances, even if they have the same financial flexibility. The author's statement that they \"know she will regret it\" is pretty strong and could be seen as judgmental. People have different values\u2014some might prefer work-life balance, others prefer more involvement in their child's early days. By implying that the sister's choice is wrong, the author might be overstepping. So, even though the author's intentions are good, the way they delivered the advice and the certainty about the sister's future regret could be why the sister got upset. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they crossed a boundary by not respecting the sister's decision and being judgmental.\n"
