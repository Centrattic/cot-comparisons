In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about staying home with the baby instead of going back to work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who has stayed home with their kids, gave advice about the value of being present for milestones. The sister took offense, saying it was condescending. The author thinks they're not wrong because they're just sharing their views.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about giving advice, especially in a family context. The author is close to their sister and has given guidance before. But in this case, the sister didn't appreciate it. The author is trying to share their experience, but the sister felt it was condescending.\n\nI remember that in these types of situations, it's often about how the advice is delivered and the sister's autonomy. Even if the author's intentions are good, the sister has her own reasons for choosing to work. Maybe the author didn't consider that the sister might have different priorities or financial considerations, even if they can afford to stay home. The author's approach might have come off as judgmental, implying that the sister is making a mistake, which could be why the sister felt attacked.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job\" is pretty strong. It's making a definitive claim about the sister's future feelings, which can be hurtful. Everyone's circumstances are different. The author's sister might value her career or have other reasons for returning to work that the author isn't considering. The author's advice might be well-meaning but could be overstepping by not respecting the sister's choice.\n\nThe sister's husband is able to support her, so maybe the financial aspect isn't the main issue. However, personal choice and emotional well-being are important. The author might be projecting their own values onto their sister without considering that the sister might have a different approach to parenting. It's possible that the author's delivery was too forceful, making it sound like they're the only right way to do things, which can be condescending.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions are good, the way they delivered the advice might have been inconsiderate of the sister's autonomy and personal choices. The sister's reaction might be valid because she feels her decisions are being judged. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
