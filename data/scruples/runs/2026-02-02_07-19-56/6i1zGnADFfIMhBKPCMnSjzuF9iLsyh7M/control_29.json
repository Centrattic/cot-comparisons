In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The sister went back to work at 6 weeks, and the author expressed their concerns about missing out on the baby's milestones and the risks of daycare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between siblings. The author mentions they have been close their whole lives and have given advice before. So, maybe the sister expects some input, but the way the advice was received was negative. The sister felt condescended, which is a key point here. The author might be in the wrong if the advice was delivered in a way that was judgmental or not respectful of their sister's choices.\n\nThe author's intention was to share their own positive experience of staying home with their kids. However, even if the advice is well-meaning, the sister's right to make her own decisions should be considered. Parents have different priorities and circumstances. The sister and her husband can afford to have her go back to work, maybe for financial reasons or career goals. The author's advice might not take into account their sister's personal situation or the family's needs beyond what the author knows.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"AITA for telling my sister she'll regret going back to work\" implies the author is imposing their own regrets onto their sister. Everyone's experience is different, and assuming someone will regret a choice they've made is not helpful. The author should respect their sister's autonomy in this decision. Even if the author believes staying home is better, it's not their place to dictate that choice.\n\nThe sister's reaction of feeling condescended might be because the advice came across as moral superior, not as a suggestion. The line about risking the baby with strangers and not doing it right could be seen as attacking the daycare choice, which is a valid and common decision for many families. The author didn't present alternatives or listen to their sister's reasoning, which could have led to the conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, the way they delivered the advice and the assumption that their sister will regret her choice could be seen as overstepping. The sister has the right to make her own decisions about parenting, and the author should respect that even if they disagree. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
