In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after childbirth. The sister chose to return to work and use daycare, and the author tried to explain why they think it's better to stay home. The sister took offense, calling the author condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a close sibling, so their intention might be to help. They share their own experience of staying home with their kids and the benefits they observed. But the sister felt that the advice was intrusive and condescending. The key here is whether the author overstepped or not.\n\nFamily dynamics can be tricky. While sharing personal experiences is natural, the sister might feel that her choice is being judged. The author's message could come off as implying that the sister's decision is wrong, which can trigger defensiveness. Even if the author's intention is good, the way the advice is given matters. Using phrases like \"you will regret\" and questioning her decision might not be helpful and could be perceived as critical.\n\nAlso, the author assumes that staying home is the ideal scenario and that daycare is risky. However, every parent has different circumstances. The sister might have her own reasons for returning to work, which the author didn't address. It's possible that the sister values her career, needs the financial support, or feels it's best for her mental health. The author didn't acknowledge these possibilities, which might have made the sister feel unheard.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for sharing their perspective, but they might have handled it poorly. The sister's choice is her own, and while the author's advice is based on their experience, it's important to respect differing opinions. The line between giving advice and being condescending can be thin here. The author's insistence on their own path and the negative framing (\"regret\", \"strangers\") could be the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy and presented their views in a way that was possibly condescending and dismissive of other valid reasons for returning to work.\n"
