In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister she'll regret going back to work after childbirth. The sister went back to work at 6 weeks, and the author tried to advise her against it, sharing their own experience of staying home with their kids. The sister got upset, called the author condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and sister are close, so the intention was to give advice. The author's own situation is that they had the means to stay home, and the sister also has financial support. The key point here is whether giving this advice, even if well-intentioned, is considered inconsiderate or overstepping.\n\nThe sister's reaction was negative. Maybe she felt judged. The author is justifying their advice by saying they know she'll regret it. But every parent's decision is personal. The author might be imposing their own values without considering other factors, like the sister's personal or career needs. The author might not be in the wrong per se, but the way the advice was given could have been better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about boundaries. The sister might have felt the author was being condescending, which the author denies. Advice can be given if offered respectfully, but if it comes off as judgmental, even with good intentions, it can be hurtful. The author's statement that the sister will \"regret\" her choice is strong and might imply that the author is certain of the outcome, which could be dismissive of the sister's own reasoning. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be good, the manner of delivery and the absolute statement about regret could be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy and decision, even if they have a good reason. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
