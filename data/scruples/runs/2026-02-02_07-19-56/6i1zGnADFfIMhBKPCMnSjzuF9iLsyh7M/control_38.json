In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after having a baby. The sister is going back to work after four weeks, putting the baby in daycare. The user tried to explain how meaningful it is to stay home and be there for milestones, and the sister took offense, saying the advice was condescending.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is at fault here. The key points are about giving advice versus being judgmental. The sister was close to the user, so maybe she expected support, not unsolicited advice. The user's reasoning is that they're sharing their own positive experience, but the sister might feel like they're being criticized. \n\nIs it wrong to give advice even if it's not wanted? Well, the user's intention was to share their perspective, but maybe they didn't consider the sister's feelings or autonomy. The sister has her own situation\u2014maybe she has career goals, or the daycare is necessary for her family's financial reasons, even if they can afford it. The user might be assuming that staying home is always better, but every family makes different choices. \n\nThe user also says they think the sister will regret it. That could come off as judgmental. Even if the user's advice is well-meaning, delivering it in a way that suggests someone else's choice is wrong can be hurtful. The sister might feel like her decision is being invalidated. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for having their opinion or sharing their own experience. However, the way they presented the advice might have been too pushy or not respectful of their sister's choice. The line between giving advice and being condescending is thin. Since the sister felt condescended to, the user might have overstepped by implying her choice is inferior without considering her perspective.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they gave unsolicited advice in a way that was perceived as judgmental, not respecting their sister's autonomy to make her own decision.\n"
