In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for advising their sister to stay home with her baby instead of going back to work. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author has a close relationship with their sister and has given her guidance before. They stayed home with their own kids, and now their sister is making a different choice. The author tried to explain the benefits of staying home, mentioning milestones like first steps and words, and the risks of daycare. The sister got defensive, called the author condescending, and the author feels like they're right because they think the sister will regret it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about advising versus pressuring, and respecting personal choices. The author's intention was to give advice based on their own experience, but the sister felt it was condescending. The author might not realize that their sister could have her own reasons for choosing to work. Maybe the sister values her career, needs personal time, or has other family dynamics. The author is assuming that staying home is the better option and that the sister will regret working, which might not be fair. Everyone's situation is different, even if the financial ability is there. It's also possible that the sister feels the author is overstepping by implying she's making a wrong choice.\n\nAlso, the author says they would want every parent to stay home, but that's not feasible for everyone. The sister might be making a choice that's right for her and her family, even if it's different from the author's path. The author's message might come across as judgmental rather than supportive. Even if the advice is well-meaning, the way it was delivered could have made the sister feel criticized. The sister's reaction suggests that the author's approach was not well-received, so maybe they did overstep. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like they're not respecting their sister's autonomy. While sharing experiences is okay, implying that her choice is wrong and that she'll regret it might be too much. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should allow their sister to make her own decision without pressure, even if they disagree.\n"
