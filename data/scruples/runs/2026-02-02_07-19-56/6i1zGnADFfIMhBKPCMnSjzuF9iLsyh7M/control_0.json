In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about staying home with the baby. The sister went back to work after four weeks, and the author tried to explain the benefits of staying home. The sister took offense, saying the author was condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has personal experience of staying home with their kids and is trying to share that advice. They mention they had the financial means to do so, and their sister does too. So the advice isn't about financial constraints but about the experience and bonding time.\n\nThe main issue here is whether giving advice, even with good intentions, is wrong if it's not wanted. The author tried to explain their perspective, which is valid, but the sister felt it was condescending. There's a difference between offering advice and being pushy. The author might be overstepping by assuming their way is the only correct one. Every parent has different circumstances and choices. The sister might have her reasons for returning to work, like career goals, personal fulfillment, or even financial reasons beyond just staying home. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that they know the sister will regret it is a strong assertion. It's possible that the author is projecting their own values but not considering that the sister's decision is valid for her situation. The key point is autonomy. The sister has the right to make her own choice without judgment. Even if the advice is well-meaning, it can come off as judgmental if not received well.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to share their experience, but they might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's decision and possibly being condescending. The line between helpful advice and overstepping can be thin. The answer might hinge on whether the advice was given in a way that respected the sister's autonomy or if it was more about imposing their views.\n"
