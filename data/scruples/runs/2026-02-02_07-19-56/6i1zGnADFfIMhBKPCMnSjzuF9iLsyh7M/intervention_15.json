In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for advising their sister not to return to work after giving birth. The sister took their advice negatively, calling them condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids and stayed home with them for the first year, which they're grateful for because their job allowed it. Their sister and her husband have the financial means to do the same. The author's intention seems to be to share their positive experience of staying home, emphasizing the bonding and developmental milestones. However, the sister didn't take the advice well, feeling criticized and defensive.\n\nThe key points here are about the appropriateness of giving advice. The author thinks they're helping, but their sister perceived it as condescending. The question is whether the author overstepped by offering their opinion, even if it's well-intentioned.\n\nIn many cases, family dynamics come into play. Siblings, especially close ones, might have different parenting styles. The author might have good intentions, but the way they presented the advice could be seen as judgmental. Also, the sister's decision to return to work might be based on her own circumstances, such as career considerations, personal preferences, or maybe the husband's support isn't as solid as the author thinks. The author's assumption that the sister will regret her choice could be projecting their own values onto her.\n\nAnother angle is the right to make personal choices. Even if the author believes their path is better, the sister has the right to choose what's best for her family. The author's advice might have come across as dismissive of her situation, leading to the sister feeling attacked.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while sharing experiences is fine, imposing one's views without acknowledging the other person's autonomy can be problematic. The author didn't present their advice as a suggestion but rather as a warning of regret, which might have been off-putting.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's decision-making process and possibly came across as judgmental. Even with good intentions, the manner of delivery matters. The correct answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
