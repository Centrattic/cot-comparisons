In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister is going back to work after her baby was born just four weeks ago. The author tried to persuade her not to, talking about the importance of being there for milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister got defensive, called the author condescending and told her to butt out. Now the author is asking if they're the a**hole for giving advice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and sister are close, and the author has stayed home with their kids. The sister has the financial ability to do the same. The author's intention seems to come from a place of caring, wanting the best for her sister's child and her experience as a parent.\n\nBut then, the way the advice was given might be the issue. The author says she \"tried to explain\" her feelings and the joy of staying home. However, the sister felt condescended to, which suggests that the author's approach might have been perceived as judgmental or not considering her sister's perspective. The author also states that she knows her sister will regret it, which could come off as assuming she knows better than her sister, even though they're both making choices based on their own situations.\n\nThe key here is whether the author overstepped by giving unsolicited advice in a way that's shaming or not respecting her sister's autonomy. Even if the author has good intentions, the sister might have her own reasons for returning to work\u2014maybe she needs the job, wants to maintain her career, or feels the daycare is better than she can provide. The author's insistence that her sister will regret it could be seen as invalidating her sister's decision and not respecting her right to make her own choices.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that if she had her way, every parent would stay home, which is an ideal but not always feasible. However, the sister has the financial support to do so, so the author's advice might be more about her personal values rather than practical concerns. It's possible that the advice was more about the author's beliefs rather than addressing the sister's actual situation or needs.\n\nIn relationships, especially with family, boundaries are important. While it's natural to want to help, pushing one's own views without considering the other person's feelings or autonomy can lead to conflict. The sister's reaction indicates that she felt her decision was being criticized, which is why she became defensive.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's intention was to offer advice from a caring place, but the way it was delivered might have been condescending and not respectful of her sister's choice. The sister has the right to make her own decisions, even if they differ from the author's. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's autonomy and for delivering the advice in a way that was perceived as judgmental.\n"
