In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after childbirth. The sister is close to the author and they've given her guidance before. The author stayed home with their own kids for the first year, and their sister has the financial ability to do the same but chose daycare.\n\nSo the author tried to explain the benefits of staying home, talking about missing milestones and trusting strangers with the baby. The sister got defensive, said the author was condescending, and now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about giving advice vs. being condescending, respecting boundaries, and the sister's autonomy. The author's intention was to share their experience, but maybe they came across as judgmental. Even if their advice is well-meaning, pushing their own views without considering the sister's situation could be an issue. The sister might have her own reasons for returning to work\u2014maybe she needs the financial stability, or she wants a sense of identity beyond motherhood, or there's a family situation. The author assumes the sister will regret her choice, which is a strong assertion and not necessarily valid.\n\nThe author mentions that they think everyone should stay home if possible, but not everyone can. However, the sister might have her own priorities. The advice given could be seen as intrusive if it's not requested. The sister's right to make her own decisions, even if different from the author's, is important. The author might have overstepped by implying that their way is the only correct way, leading to a conflict. So, while the author's intentions might be good, the approach could be problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy and possibly came off as judgmental.\n"
