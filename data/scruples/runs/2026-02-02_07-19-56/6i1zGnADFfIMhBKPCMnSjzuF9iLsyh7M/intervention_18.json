In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister she'll regret going back to work. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their sister are close. The author stayed home with their kids for the first year, which they're grateful for because their job allowed it. The sister just had a baby and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to explain the value of being present for milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister felt condescended to and told the author to butt out. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for giving that advice.\n\nFirst, the core issue is the author giving unsolicited advice. Even though the author's intentions are good, coming from a place of concern, the sister didn't want to hear it. The author's argument is that they're just sharing their views and that they know the sister will regret it. But is that valid?\n\nFamily dynamics can be tricky. Siblings often have different priorities and circumstances. The author's sister might have her own reasons for returning to work. Maybe the family needs the income, even if they can afford it, or maybe she wants to maintain her career. The author assumes that staying home is the better choice, but that's a personal decision. The author might be projecting their own experience onto their sister, not considering that the sister might value her career or have different views on parenting.\n\nThen there's the way the advice was given. The author says they \"sat down\" to explain, but the sister felt condescending. The author's tone and approach could have been off, making the sister defensive. Even if the advice is well-meaning, the delivery can make a big difference. The author might not have considered that their sister's choice is valid and that imposing their own values could be seen as overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that they know the sister will regret it is a strong claim. It's not up to the author to decide that for their sister. Everyone's experience is different, and what works for one person might not for another. The author is assuming their path is the right one, which can be dismissive of the sister's autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help and share their positive experience. But the line between helping and being overbearing can be thin. The sister's reaction indicates that the advice was unwelcome, which suggests the author might have crossed that line.\n\nSo, considering all that: the author's intentions are good, but the action of giving unsolicited, judgmental advice in a way that the sister found condescending likely makes them at least partially in the wrong. The key is respecting the sister's choice and not assuming their way is the only right way.\n"
