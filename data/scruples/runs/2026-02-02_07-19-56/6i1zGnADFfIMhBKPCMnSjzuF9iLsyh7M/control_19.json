In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after her baby was just four weeks old. The sister is going back to work at six weeks and putting the baby in daycare. The author is trying to explain their perspective on staying home with kids, using their own experience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sister has the financial means to stay home, so she's choosing to work. The author is sharing their personal experience and feelings about missing out on early milestones. The sister didn't take the advice well and accused the author of being condescending.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and the nature of the advice. The author is close to their sister and has given guidance before. But in this case, the sister might feel that her choice is being criticized, especially since they have different circumstances. The author might have overstepped by implying the sister will regret her decision, which could come off as judgmental.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they don't think it's condescending to share their views. But the sister perceived it as such. The author's reasoning includes saying that she should take advantage of her husband's support to stay home. This could be seen as pushing their own values rather than respecting the sister's choice. Even if the author's intentions are good, forcing advice on someone else can be hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is that parents have different priorities. Some might value career, financial stability, personal fulfillment from work, or other factors. The author's perspective is valid, but the sister's decision is hers to make. The author's message might have been delivered in a way that made the sister feel shamed for her choice, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong in their opinion or in caring about their sister's well-being, but the way they expressed it might have been inappropriate. The sister has the right to make her own decisions, even if they differ from the author's. The author might have crossed a line by being judgmental and not respecting her autonomy in this decision.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because giving unsolicited advice in a way that makes someone feel judged can be harmful, even if the advice comes from a good place.\n"
