In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author told their sister she'd regret going back to work after giving birth. The sister didn't take it well, called them condescending and told them to butt out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has personal experience of staying home with their kids and is sharing their perspective. They mention that they had the financial ability to do so, and their sister does too. So the sister's decision to return to work isn't about financial necessity, which might be a sensitive point. \n\nThe author is trying to explain the emotional value of being present for the child's milestones. But maybe they approached it in a way that came off as judgmental. Even if their intentions were good, if the sister felt criticized, that could be problematic. The key here is whether the author overstepped by making their opinion seem like the only right one, especially since the sister had already made her decision.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction suggests she felt the advice was intrusive. The author might not have considered that their sister might have her own reasons for returning to work, which could be important to her, like career goals or personal fulfillment. The author's message that the sister will \"regret\" her choice implies a certainty that their way is better, which can be hurtful regardless of the intent.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author might believe they're offering helpful guidance, the way they delivered it and the sister's reaction indicate that it was received negatively. The sister's autonomy in making decisions about her family is a big factor here. Even with good intentions, the author might have been dismissive of the sister's own values and circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, though well-meaning, likely crossed a boundary by being judgmental and not respecting the sister's choice. That would make the answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
