In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister advising her sister not to go back to work after having a baby. The author argues that staying home is better for bonding and milestones, and she even mentions the risks of daycare. Her sister took offense and said the advice was condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They are close, but this is a very personal decision. The author's intention was to share her perspective based on her own experience. But how did she present it? She says she \"tried to explain the feeling\" and asked rhetorical questions implying regret. That could come off as judgmental. Even if her motives are good, the way she delivered the advice might have been harsh.\n\nNext, the sister's reaction: she felt condescended to. The author might not see it that way, but if the sister felt attacked, that's a problem. The key here is whether the advice was given in a way that respected her sister's autonomy. The author is assuming her sister will regret the choice, which isn't a neutral stance. Everyone has different circumstances, and the sister chose to go back to work, possibly for valid reasons like financial needs, career goals, or personal balance.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister's husband can support her financially, so maybe she's implying that the sister should take advantage of that. But even with financial support, the decision to work isn't just about money. It's a personal choice influenced by many factors. The author might not have considered her sister's individual motivations or the couple's specific situation.\n\nAnother angle: the author is projecting her own experience. She stayed home with her kids, but that doesn't mean it's the only valid path. The sister might have different priorities. The author's approach could be seen as imposing her values without acknowledging that her sister might have her own reasons for returning to work. The use of phrases like \"you'll regret it\" is a strong statement that could be hurtful, regardless of intent.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about boundaries and respect. While giving advice is okay, doing so in a way that makes someone feel judged or criticized is where the line is crossed. The author might have overstepped by being prescriptive instead of inquisitive, not leaving room for her sister's perspective. The sister's right to make her own choices, even if they differ from the author's views, is important.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because her advice was delivered in a way that disrespected her sister's autonomy and came off as condescending, even if the intention was good. The answer leans towards A.\n"
