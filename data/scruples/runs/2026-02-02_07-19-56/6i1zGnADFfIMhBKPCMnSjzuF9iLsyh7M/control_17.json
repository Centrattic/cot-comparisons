In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation (the author) is in the wrong. The question is whether giving advice to their sister about not going back to work is AITA (Am I the Asshole). The answer needs to be either A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nLet me break down the situation. The author has a sister who had a baby four weeks ago and plans to return to work in six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to advise her, sharing their own experience of staying home with their kids and the value of that time. The sister took offense, called the author condescending, and told them to butt out. The author is now asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions they've been close their whole lives and have given guidance before. So, maybe the sister expected advice, but the way it was delivered might have been an issue. The author's advice is based on their own positive experience, but the sister has different circumstances. The key here is whether the advice was delivered in a condescending manner, even if the author didn't mean it that way.\n\nThe sister's reaction suggests that she felt judged or criticized. The author says they don't think they were condescending, but the sister did. The line \"how will she handle knowing her child will take first steps away from her\" might come off as assuming she's making a bad decision. The author is advocating for staying home because she believes it's the better choice, but the sister might feel pressured or shamed.\n\nIt's important to note that every family's situation is different. The author and sister both have the financial ability to stay home, but maybe the sister has other reasons for returning to work\u2014personal fulfillment, career goals, or even financial considerations (even if they can afford it, maybe they want to contribute differently). The author's insistence that she \"will regret\" her decision might be overstepping, as it's not their place to predict someone else's feelings or make them feel guilty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to share their own positive experience and encourage their sister to consider the benefits. The sister's reaction is valid because even well-meaning advice can come across as condescending if not delivered carefully. The author might not be wrong in wanting to share their perspective, but the way they did it likely crossed a line by making the sister feel judged. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's autonomy and for delivering the advice in a way that was perceived negatively.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the advice was given respectfully and whether the author overstepped. Since the sister felt condescended to and the author is now justifying their approach, it's possible the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely A (Yes), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the advice was given as a suggestion without pressure, maybe B. But the sister's reaction and the author's insistence that the sister will regret her choice points more towards A.\n"
