In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister against going back to work after giving birth. The sister is upset and felt condescending. The author's reasoning is that staying home is better for bonding and milestones, but the sister chose daycare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and sister are close, and the author is trying to give advice based on their own experience. However, the sister might feel that her choice is being judged. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way the advice was given could have been perceived as condescending. The sister might feel pressured, especially since they have their own circumstances. Maybe the author didn't consider that their sister has her own reasons for returning to work, like career goals or personal fulfillment, which are also valid. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they know the sister will regret it. That's a strong statement and might come off as dismissive of the sister's decision. Everyone's situation is different, and what works for one family might not for another. The author might be overstepping by implying that their choice is wrong. Even though the author is coming from a place of caring, the method of communication could be the issue here. The sister's reaction suggests that she felt attacked, which might not have been the author's intention, but the effect is still there.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing their perspective, which isn't inherently wrong. But advising someone else's parenting choices can be sensitive. The key is whether the advice was given in a way that respected the sister's autonomy. If the author was more about expressing their own views without being judgmental, that's different. But the sister felt the need to tell them to \"butt out,\" indicating that the advice wasn't welcome. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they overstepped, even if their intentions were good. The answer would be A.\n"
