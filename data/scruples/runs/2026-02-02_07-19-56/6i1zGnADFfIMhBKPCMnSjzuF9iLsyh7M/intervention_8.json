In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for advising their sister about returning to work after childbirth. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who stayed home with their own children, tried to convince her sister that staying home is better because of the bonding and milestones. The sister took offense, calling the author condescending. Now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong. I need to consider different angles. On one hand, the author is sharing their own experience and perspective, which might be well-intentioned. They value the time with children and want their sister to have that experience. On the other hand, the sister made her own decision based on her circumstances. The author's advice might come across as judgmental, especially if it's not requested. \n\nFamily dynamics matter here. Even if the advice is given from a good place, the sister might feel pressured or criticized, especially in a sensitive postpartum period. The author's approach could be seen as condescending, as the sister pointed out. It's important to respect others' choices even when you disagree. \n\nAlso, the sister has the financial support to stay home, but maybe she has other reasons for returning to work\u2014personal, professional, or otherwise. The author's insistence that she'll \"regret\" her choice could be hurtful and dismissive of her reasons. \n\nSo, the key points are: intention vs. impact, respecting autonomy, and the sensitivity of the situation. The author might not be in the wrong for sharing their opinion, but they might have overstepped by being judgmental and not respecting her decision. The answer hinges on whether intent justifies the approach.\n"
