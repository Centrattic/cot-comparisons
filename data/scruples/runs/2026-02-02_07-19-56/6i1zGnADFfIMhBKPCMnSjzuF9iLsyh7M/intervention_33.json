In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after giving birth. The sister didn't take the advice well and accused the author of being condescending.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to share their experience and perspective. They stayed home with their kids and believe that the time with the child is precious. The sister, however, has different circumstances and made a different choice. The key here is whether the author overstepped by giving unsolicited advice in a condescending manner.\n\nThe author mentions they \"sat down with her and tried to explain,\" which sounds like a direct conversation. The sister felt condescended to, so maybe the tone or approach was off. Even if the author's intentions were good, the way the advice was given might have been perceived as judgmental. The sister's right to make her own decisions is important. Everyone has different family dynamics, financial situations, and personal values. The author assumes that the sister will regret her choice, but that's not guaranteed and might not consider the sister's reasons for working.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in having their opinion, but they might have been in the wrong in how they presented it, especially if it came off as condescending. The sister's autonomy and feelings should be respected. The question is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate despite their good intentions. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the manner in which the advice was given and the assumption of regret without considering the sister's perspective.\n"
