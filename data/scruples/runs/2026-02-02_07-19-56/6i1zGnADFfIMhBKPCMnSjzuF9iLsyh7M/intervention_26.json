In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to return to work after giving birth. The author shares their own experience of staying home with their kids and is concerned that their sister might regret not being there for the early milestones. The sister took offense, feeling condescended to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to give advice based on their personal experience. But the sister didn't take it well. The key question is whether the author overstepped by giving unsolicited advice, even if it's from a place of care.\n\nFamily dynamics play a role here. Close relationships can sometimes lead to boundary issues. The author mentions they've been close their whole lives, so maybe the sister feels the advice is intrusive. Even if the advice is well-meaning, it's possible the sister felt her parenting choices were being criticized. \n\nThe author's argument is that they're not condescending because they know the sister will regret it. But it's not their place to decide what the sister will regret. Everyone's situation is different. The sister and her husband have the financial means to make this choice, and their decision to return to work might be based on other factors\u2014like career goals, personal fulfillment, or even the husband's willingness to support. The author assumes the sister will regret it, but that's a projection. It's possible the sister values her career and sees this as a necessary trade-off. \n\nAlso, the way the advice was given might have been a factor. The author sat down to explain their feelings, but the sister felt it was condescending. The tone and approach can turn well-intentioned advice into perceived criticism. The author might not have considered that their sister's perspective is valid and that her choice is hers alone to make. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions were good, but they might have crossed a boundary by assuming they know what's best for their sister. The sister has the right to make her own decisions about her family and career. Even if the author's advice is based on their own positive experience, it's not necessarily the only valid path. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because giving unsolicited advice, especially about personal choices, can be seen as overstepping, even if the intent is good. The author should respect their sister's autonomy and different life choices.\n"
