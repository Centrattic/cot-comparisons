In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister to stay home with her baby instead of going back to work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who stayed home with their own kids, is advising her sister about the value of being there for milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister didn't take it well, calling the author condescending. The author is asking if they did something wrong.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Is giving advice in the first place wrong? The author is a close family member, so maybe they have good intentions. But the sister might feel that the advice is intrusive. The author mentions they tried to explain their perspective, which is about the emotional benefits of staying home. However, the sister might have different priorities or circumstances, like financial needs or career goals. The author assumes that staying home is better, but maybe the sister has her own reasons for working.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Even if the advice is well-meaning, the sister might not want to hear it, especially if it's framed as a criticism. The author might be projecting their own choices onto their sister, not considering that the sister might have different values or situations. For example, maybe the sister and her husband have plans that require her income, or she might feel that daycare is a better option for the baby. \n\nAlso, the author says they don't think it's condescending to share their views, but the sister perceived it that way. That's a red flag. Condescension can happen when someone gives advice thinking they know better, even if they don't mean to. The author might not realize that their sister is making a different choice that's valid for her own reasons.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's intent is to help, they might be infringing on the sister's autonomy. Every parent should have the right to decide what's best for their family. The author's role as a sister is to support, not to dictate. Even if the author believes staying home is better, the sister has her own reasons. The key issue is respecting the sister's decision without judgment.\n\nSo the answer is AITA? Well, the author's intentions are good, but the way they gave advice might have been condescending, leading to the sister feeling judged. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's choice and imposing their own values.\n"
