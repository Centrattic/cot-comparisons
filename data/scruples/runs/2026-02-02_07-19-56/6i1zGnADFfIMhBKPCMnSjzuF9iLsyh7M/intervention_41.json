In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister against returning to work so soon after giving birth.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who stayed home with their kids, shared their experience and expressed concerns about missing milestones. The sister reacted poorly, saying the advice was condescending. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the right to give advice versus overstepping. The author is close to their sister and wants to share their perspective. But maybe they crossed a line by being judgmental. The sister chose a different path, and the author is projecting their own values as the \"right\" way. \n\nIn many cases, parents make different choices based on their circumstances. Even though they can afford to stay home, the sister might have personal or professional reasons to return. The author's tone might have come off as judgmental, especially mentioning regret and implying the sister will regret her choice. That could be condescending.\n\nAlso, the sister's autonomy is important. While family advice is common, it's not always appropriate to dictate another's decisions. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's choice and for being condescending, even if their intentions were good.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
