In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for advising their sister not to return to work. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to explain their perspective about the value of staying home with the child and the potential regrets, but the sister took offense, saying they were condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to share their experience and advice based on their own choices. They stayed home with their kids for the first year because their job allowed it. The sister has the financial means to make a similar choice. However, the sister chose a different path, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about giving advice versus being condescending. The author might feel they're helping by sharing their insights, but the sister felt it was intrusive. The question is whether the author overstepped by giving unsolicited advice, even if well-meaning.\n\nIn many cultures, family members often give advice, especially on parenting. However, boundaries can be sensitive. The sister might feel that her personal choice is being judged, which can hurt. The author's approach of pointing out the negative aspects (like missing milestones) could be seen as guilt-tripping, which can come off as condescending. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they believe the sister will regret it, which is a strong statement. That could imply that their own choice is the correct one, which might not consider the sister's unique circumstances or desires. Maybe the sister has other reasons for returning to work, like career goals, personal fulfillment, or even financial planning beyond just the immediate support from her husband.\n\nThe sister's right to make her own decisions is important. Even if the author's advice is from a good place, the sister might feel her autonomy is being undermined. The author might not have considered that their sister might have her own reasons for choosing daycare and work, which are equally valid.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, the way they delivered the advice could be problematic. Unsolicited advice, especially when it's framed as a prediction of regret, can come across as condescending. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's choice and for the manner in which they gave the advice.\n"
