In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a sister advising her older sister not to go back to work after having a baby, instead suggesting she stay home. The sister who wrote the post is trying to explain that she's just giving advice based on her own experience, and she's upset because her sister didn't take it well.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had the option to stay home with her kids because of financial support from her job, and she's sharing that experience. The sister in question chose to go back to work, and the author is questioning if she's at fault for giving her opinion.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and respect. The author is a sister who's close, so maybe she feels it's her role to advise. But is it her place to tell her sister what to do? Even if the advice is well-intentioned, the sister might feel that the other is overstepping. The author mentions that she tried to explain the feelings of watching a child grow, which is a personal perspective. However, the sister took offense, calling her condescending. The author might not realize that even with good intentions, the delivery or the assumption that her way is better could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author assumes the sister will regret her decision. That's a strong statement and could come off as judgmental. Every parent has different circumstances and choices. The sister's decision to work might be based on her own priorities, financial needs, or personal goals. The author's advice, while from a place of love, might not consider the sister's individual situation beyond the financial aspect mentioned.\n\nAnother angle is the right to make personal choices. The sister in question has her own life and decisions to make. The author might be in the wrong if she's imposing her views without acknowledging that the sister has her own reasons. It's important to respect others' choices even if you disagree.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's intention is to help, but the way she gave advice and the assumption of regret could be seen as condescending. The sister's reaction is valid because she might feel her autonomy is being questioned. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
