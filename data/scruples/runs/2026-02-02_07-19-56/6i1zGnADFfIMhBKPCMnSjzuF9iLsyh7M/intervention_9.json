In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about staying home with her baby instead of going back to work. The sister just had a baby four weeks ago and plans to start daycare at six weeks. The author tried to explain the benefits of being with the child during those early milestones, but the sister took it as condescending and told them to butt out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has personal experience of staying home with their children, so they're coming from a place of personal choice and experience. They believe that their sister will regret not being there. But is it their place to give that advice, even if it's well-meaning?\n\nThe key points here might be about respecting boundaries and autonomy. The sister made a decision based on her and her husband's financial situation and personal preferences. The author, while trying to share their perspective, might have overstepped by implying that their sister's choice is wrong. Even if the advice is given with good intentions, the sister felt it was condescending and intrusive. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they would prefer every parent to stay home, but that's not feasible for everyone. However, the sister's choice is valid given their financial situation. The author might be projecting their own values onto their sister without considering different circumstances or preferences. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the question is whether the author overstepped. The sister's reaction suggests that she felt her autonomy was being questioned. The author might not be in the wrong for sharing their opinion, but if they did so in a condescending or judgmental way, that's where the issue lies. However, the author claims they didn't mean to be condescending. But the sister's reaction indicates that she perceived it that way. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author respected their sister's right to make her own decision without judgment. Even if the advice is well-intentioned, pushing one's views without considering the other person's situation and feelings can be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's choice and overstepping boundaries.\n"
