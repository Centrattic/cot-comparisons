In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for advising their sister to not go back to work and instead stay home with her baby. The sister's situation is that she had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to explain the value of being present for the child's milestones and the risks of daycare, but the sister felt condescended to and told them to butt out.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were appropriate. The key points here are the author's intent and approach. They mention they're close to their sister and have been giving guidance. The advice itself is about staying home with the child, which is a personal choice. However, the sister might feel that the advice is being given in a judgmental way, especially if the author is implying that the sister will regret her decision. \n\nThe author states they don't think it's condescending, but the sister did. Even if the intention is good, the perception matters. The question is whether the author overstepped by pressuring their sister, even if it's from a place of care. The sister's right to make her own decisions about her career and family life is important. The author might be assuming that daycare is risky or that staying home is better, but every parent has different circumstances and values. The author's sister might have reasons for returning to work that the author isn't considering, like career opportunities, financial considerations beyond just support, or personal well-being. \n\nAlso, the timing of the advice\u2014right after giving birth\u2014could be sensitive. New parents often feel vulnerable, and unsolicited advice, even if well-meaning, can come off as intrusive. The author might have a valid perspective, but the way it was delivered and the fact that it's their sister's decision to make, regardless of the author's opinion, could mean they are in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. \n\nSo, even though the author's intentions are good, the sister has the right to make her own choices without being told she'll regret them. The author might not be in the right because they were imposing their view as the correct one, leading to a judgmental tone. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
