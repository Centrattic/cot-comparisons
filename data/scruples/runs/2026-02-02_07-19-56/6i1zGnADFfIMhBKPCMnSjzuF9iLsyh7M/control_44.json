In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister is close to her sibling and has given her advice based on her own experience of staying home with her children. She shared her feelings about missing out on milestones like first steps and words if the baby is in daycare. The sister didn't take the advice well and accused her of being condescending. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about boundaries in giving advice, the sister's reaction, and whether the advice was condescending. The author's intentions were good, but maybe the delivery was off? Or is the sister just being defensive?\n\nWell, the author is sharing their own experience and perspective, which is valid. But when they start implying that the sister will regret her decision, that might come off as judgmental or prescriptive. The sister might feel her choice is being invalidated, especially since they have the financial means to make that choice. The author's emphasis on how fulfilling staying home is might not consider that the sister might have different priorities or reasons for going back to work, like career goals, financial planning, or personal fulfillment from their job.\n\nAlso, the author claims the sister is wrong and will regret it, which can be seen as condescending. Even if the advice is well-meaning, the tone and the assumption that one path is superior could be the issue. Everyone's situation is different, and the sister might value her career and the daycare option for other reasons, like providing a better environment or needing personal time. The author didn't ask about her reasons but instead focused on their own experiences, which could be why the sister felt the advice was intrusive.\n\nSo, while the author's intention was to help, they might have overstepped by not respecting their sister's autonomy. The sister has the right to make her own decisions based on her family's needs and her own values. The author isn't necessarily at fault for sharing their opinion, but the way it was delivered and the judgmental tone could be problematic. It's a balance between offering support and respecting boundaries. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the condescending approach and invalidating the sister's choice.\n"
