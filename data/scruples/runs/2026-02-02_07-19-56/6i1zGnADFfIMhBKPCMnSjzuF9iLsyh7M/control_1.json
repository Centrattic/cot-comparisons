In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister has a newborn and decided to go back to work after four weeks, putting the baby in daycare. The author, who stayed home with their kids for the first year, tried to advise her against it, explaining their own positive experiences and the potential regrets. The sister took offense, saying the advice was condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions they've been close their whole lives and have given guidance before. So, the intention might be to help, but the sister felt it was intrusive. The key issue here is whether the advice was given in a condescending manner. The author thinks they're just sharing their views, but the sister felt it was condescending. That could mean the way it was delivered was off-putting, even if the content was well-meaning.\n\nAlso, the sister's autonomy is important. Even if the author thinks staying home is better, the sister has her own reasons for returning to work. Maybe financial needs, personal goals, or other factors. The author's advice might undermine her agency. The author also assumes the sister will regret her choice, which is a strong assumption. Everyone's circumstances are different; what worked for the author might not be the right path for the sister.\n\nMoreover, the phrase \"I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views\" suggests the author isn't seeing the sister's perspective. Even if the advice is given without malice, the sister's reaction is valid. The author might have overstepped by implying that their way is the right way, possibly coming across as judgmental. The sister's right to make her own decisions, even if they differ from the author's, should be respected.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author isn't wrong for caring or wanting to share their experience, but they might have failed to respect the sister's autonomy and the complexity of her decision. The wrong isn't necessarily in the advice itself, but in how it was delivered and the assumption that the sister's choice is wrong. So, while the author's intentions were good, the approach could be seen as overbearing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not allowing the sister to make her own choice without pressure.\n"
