In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to return to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to advise her about the value of staying home, mentioning missing milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister got upset, called the author condescending, and the author is now wondering if they were wrong to give advice.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author's intention was to share their personal experience and advice based on their own choices. They have two kids they stayed home with, so they have a perspective from that experience. Their sister, however, and her husband can afford for her to stay home, but she's choosing to work. The author is concerned that the sister will regret it later.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn these types of situations, boundaries and how advice is given are important. The sister might feel that her personal choice is being judged, especially if the advice comes off as prescriptive rather than supportive. The author mentions that they tried to explain their views, but the sister felt condescending. Condescension can happen when someone gives advice in a way that makes the other person feel belittled or as if their choices are being criticized without understanding their circumstances.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they're sharing their perspective, and they believe the sister will regret it. However, every family's situation is different. Even though the sister can afford to stay home, she might have other reasons for returning to work\u2014like personal fulfillment, career goals, or even a desire to maintain their identity outside of motherhood. The author's advice, while coming from a good place, might not consider these factors, and the way it was delivered could have been perceived as dismissive of the sister's own decisions.\n\nAlso, the line \"I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views\" is key. The author is defending their approach by justifying their own experience, but the sister's reaction suggests that she felt judged. Even if the advice is well-meaning, if it's received negatively, the method might be at fault. The author might not be in the wrong for offering advice, but the way it was delivered could have been problematic. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, providing unsolicited advice, especially on personal decisions like parenting choices, can be seen as crossing a line if it's not welcomed. The sister's response indicates that the advice was delivered in a way that felt intrusive. The author might not be entirely wrong because they have a valid perspective, but they might be overstepping by not respecting the sister's autonomy in the decision. The answer might lean towards A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because the sister's reaction and the sister's right to make her own choices, even if it's different from the author's, are important factors. However, the author's intention is to help, so there's nuance here. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author's advice was condescending, which the sister felt it was. If the author's approach was judgmental or didn't account for the sister's specific circumstances, then the author might be in the wrong. The sister has the right to make her own decisions about parenting, even if they differ from the author's. The author's insistence that the sister will regret her choice is also a strong statement that might come across as dismissive of the sister's current decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they gave unsolicited advice in a way that made the sister feel judged, even if their intention was good. The answer would be A.\n"
