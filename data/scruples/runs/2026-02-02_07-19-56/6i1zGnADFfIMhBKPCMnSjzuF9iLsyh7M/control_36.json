In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work so soon after having a baby.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and wants to return to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who's given advice based on their own experience of staying home with their kids, expressed concerns about missing milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister got upset, called the author condescending and told them to butt out.\n\nNow, the core of the issue is whether the author was overstepping by giving unsolicited advice. The author argues they were just sharing their views, but the sister felt it was condescending. \n\nI should consider boundaries in family advice. While the author's intentions might be good, the sister might feel that her choice is being judged. Everyone's circumstances are different. The sister and her husband can afford for her to stay home, but maybe they have other reasons for returning to work\u2014like career goals, needing the income, or personal fulfillment. The author's advice could be seen as imposing their own values without considering the sister's situation.\n\nAlso, the author's approach might have been too strong. Instead of saying the sister will \"regret\" it, they could have expressed their feelings without being so definitive. The sister might feel that the advice is coming from a place of superiority, hence the condescending remark.\n\nIn general, giving advice to family can be tricky. It's important to respect others' autonomy, especially in decisions about parenting. Even if the advice is well-meaning, it's possible the author crossed a line by not respecting their sister's choice, leading to the conflict.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they gave unsolicited, potentially judgmental advice that the sister didn't want to hear, even if their intentions were good. They should have respected her decision without trying to dictate it.\n"
