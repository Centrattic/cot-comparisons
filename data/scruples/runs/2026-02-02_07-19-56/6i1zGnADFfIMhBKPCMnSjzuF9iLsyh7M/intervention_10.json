In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about not returning to work after childbirth. The sister is close to the author, who has personal experience of staying home with their kids. The author feels their advice was condescending and that their sister will regret her decision.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about giving advice and respecting boundaries. The author's intention is to share their perspective, but the sister felt it was condescending. The question is whether the author overstepped by giving unsolicited advice, even if it's well-meaning.\n\nIn many cultures, especially in close family relationships, there's a balance between offering support and respecting individual choices. While the author's experience is valid, everyone's situation is different. The sister might have her own reasons for returning to work, like financial considerations, career goals, or personal preferences. The author's assertion that the sister will \"regret\" her choice is a strong statement that could come off as judgmental. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they know the sister will regret it, which can be seen as assuming they know what's best for her without considering her autonomy. Even if the advice is given from a place of care, the manner in which it's delivered can affect the recipient. The sister's reaction suggests that the advice wasn't well-received, possibly because it felt like an intrusion on her decision.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions might be good, the act of giving unsolicited advice in a way that implies judgment could be seen as crossing a boundary. The question here is about whether the advice was given in a condescending manner and whether the author respected their sister's right to make her own choices. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider their sister's autonomy and possibly dismissed her reasons for her decision.\n"
