In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to return to work after giving birth. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who has experience staying home with their kids, gave advice about the value of that time with the child. They mentioned milestones like first steps and words, and the risks of daycare. The sister got defensive, called them condescending, and the author is now wondering if they did something wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the sister's choice and the author's approach. Parenting decisions are personal, and while the author has their own experience, they might not consider that their sister could have different priorities or circumstances. The author's intention was to share their perspective, but the sister felt judged. \n\nThe author might have overstepped by implying the sister will regret her decision. Using phrases like \"she will regret\" could come off as judgmental. Even if the advice is well-meaning, the delivery matters. The sister might feel her choice is being invalidated, especially since they can afford to stay home. Maybe she has reasons to work that the author isn't considering, like financial needs beyond daycare, career goals, or personal fulfillment.\n\nAlso, the author's statement, \"if I had it my way, every parent would stay home\" suggests they believe their approach is the only right one. That's a bit paternalistic. Every family's situation is different. The sister might value her career or have a support system that makes daycare a good choice. The author's advice, while coming from a place of care, might not respect the sister's autonomy in making her own decisions.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for giving advice, but the way they did it could be problematic. The sister's reaction indicates that the advice wasn't received well, possibly because it was given in a way that felt condescending. The author should realize that while their experience is valid, others have different values and circumstances. They should respect their sister's choice even if they disagree. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy and for delivering the advice in a judgmental manner.\n"
