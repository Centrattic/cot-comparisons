In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after having a baby. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister who just had a baby and plans to return to work at six weeks. The author tried to share their own experience of staying home with their kids and expressed concerns about missing milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister took offense, calling the advice condescending. The author is wondering if they were wrong to give advice.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is coming from a place of caring and sharing their own positive experience. They want what's best for their sister and baby. But on the other hand, the sister might feel pressured or judged. The author's advice could be seen as intrusive, especially if the sister made her own decision based on her family's circumstances.\n\nFinancial stability is a factor here. The sister's husband can support her, so maybe she's choosing to work for career reasons or personal fulfillment. The author's argument is that staying home is more fulfilling, but that's a personal choice. The key is whether the author overstepped by giving unsolicited advice in a condescending way.\n\nThe sister's reaction suggests that the advice was not welcome. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way it's delivered matters. Telling someone they'll regret their decision can come off as judgmental. The author might not have considered that their sister has her own reasons for returning to work, which could be valid and important to her.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, giving unsolicited advice that implies the sister's choice is wrong could be seen as condescending. The sister has the right to make her own decisions, and the author might have crossed a boundary by not respecting that. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
