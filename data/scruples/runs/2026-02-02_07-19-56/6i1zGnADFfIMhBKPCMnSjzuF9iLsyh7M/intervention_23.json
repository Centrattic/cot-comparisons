In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The sister had a child four weeks ago and plans to start daycare at six weeks, so the author is trying to convince her to stay home. The sister got upset and said the author was condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they stayed home with their kids for the first year and are grateful for the financial ability to do so. Their sister and her husband can also afford it. The author's advice is based on their own experience, emphasizing the importance of bonding and missing milestones. But the sister didn't take it well, seeing it as condescending.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is giving advice, which is their right, but the question is whether they're in the wrong. The sister might feel that her choices are being criticized, especially since they both have the financial means. The author's advice could be seen as judgmental, even if well-intentioned. The sister might feel that her decision to return to work is personal and the author is overstepping.\n\nIn many cases, when someone gives advice and the recipient feels it's intrusive or condescending, the advisor might be considered in the wrong if they're not respecting the other's autonomy. The author's statement that the sister will \"regret\" her decision could come off as dismissive of her own judgment and decisions. Even though the author thinks they're sharing their experience, the tone or delivery might have been a problem.\n\nAlso, the sister might have her own reasons for going back to work\u2014maybe career goals, personal fulfillment, or even financial considerations beyond just the ability to stay home. The author didn't consider these factors, assuming that staying home is better without acknowledging the sister's individual circumstances.\n\nSo, even though the author's intentions are good, the way they delivered the advice and the assumption that their path is better might be where they went wrong. The sister's right to make her own choices is important, and the author might have overstepped by being judgmental and not respecting her decision.\n"
