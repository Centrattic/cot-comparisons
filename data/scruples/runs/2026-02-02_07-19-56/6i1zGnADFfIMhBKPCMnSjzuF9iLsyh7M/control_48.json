In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth, based on their own experience of staying home with their children. The sister got upset, called them condescending, and the author is wondering if they overstepped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions being close to their sister their whole lives and offering guidance. That suggests a long-standing, trusting relationship where advice is usually given. But now the sister is reacting negatively. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that staying home is more fulfilling and important for bonding with the child. They point out the milestones and the risks of daycare. However, the sister has the financial means to choose either option. The key here is autonomy. The sister's decision to work might be based on her own values, career goals, or other factors the author isn't considering. \n\nThe author's approach might be seen as imposing their own views without considering the sister's perspective. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way the advice is given could come off as condescending, especially if the sister feels judged. The sister's right to make her own choices, even if different from the author's, is important. \n\nAlso, the author assumes the sister will regret her decision, which might not be valid. Everyone's situation is different, and the sister might have reasons the author isn't aware of. The author's advice, while well-meaning, might infringe on the sister's autonomy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for sharing their experience, but they might be wrong in how they presented it, possibly without respecting the sister's right to make her own choice. The line between helpful advice and overstepping can be thin. The sister's reaction indicates that the advice was received as intrusive, which could make the author at fault for not respecting boundaries.\n"
