In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their sister she'll regret going back to work. The sister just had a baby and is planning to return to work after six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to convince her to stay home, emphasizing the importance of being there for milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister took offense, saying the advice was condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister and author have been close their whole lives, so the author likely had good intentions. However, the key points are whether the advice was given in a condescending way and whether it's appropriate to tell someone they'll \"regret\" their decisions.\n\nThe author mentions they shared their views, but the sister felt condescended to. Even if the author didn't mean to sound condescending, the sister's reaction is valid. People can perceive advice as patronizing based on tone or delivery, even if the content is well-meaning. Also, the author is assuming their sister will regret not staying home. That's a strong statement because it's impossible to predict someone else's future feelings. It might come off as judgmental, especially since the sister and her husband have the financial means to make that choice.\n\nAdditionally, the author is implying that their own experience (staying home with their kids) is the ideal and that their sister's choice is less than optimal. While the author's perspective is valid, everyone's circumstances and values are different. The sister might prioritize her career or have other reasons for returning to work, which the author didn't consider. The advice, even if given from a place of love, might not have been respectful of the sister's autonomy in making her own decisions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped by being prescriptive and judgmental rather than supportive. The sister has the right to make her own choices, even if they differ from her sibling's. The author's intention was to guide, but the execution might have been poor. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting their sister's autonomy and possibly being condescending.\n"
