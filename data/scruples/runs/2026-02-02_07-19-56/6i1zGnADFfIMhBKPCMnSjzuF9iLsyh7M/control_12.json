In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. \n\nFirst, the sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to put the child in daycare at six weeks to return to work. The author, who stayed home with their own kids for the first year, advised her about the benefits of staying home, mentioning milestones like first steps and words. The sister took offense, saying the author was condescending.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the author's intention was to share their own positive experience. But maybe the way they presented it was too pushy. The key here is whether giving advice in that manner is condescending. The author might not have considered that their sister's situation is different. Maybe the sister and her husband need the income, or she wants to pursue her career. The author assumed she would regret it, which might be judgmental.\n\nAlso, the sister's reaction suggests she felt criticized. Even if the author's advice was well-meaning, the sister might feel that her choice is being invalidated. The author's statement that they know the sister will regret it could come off as arrogant. \n\nIn terms of boundaries, it's okay to offer advice, but it's important to respect others' decisions. The author might have overstepped by implying their way is the only right way. The answer likely hinges on the approach taken rather than the content of the advice itself. So, even if the author's perspective is valid, the delivery might have been inappropriate.\n"
