In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The situation is that the sister is going back to work at six weeks, putting the baby in daycare. The author tried to explain the value of staying home with the child and mentioned the milestones and risks of daycare. The sister got defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has personal experience staying home with their kids and is sharing their perspective. But the sister is making her own choice based on her family's situation. The key here is whether the author crossed a line by giving unsolicited advice in a condescending way, even though they meant well.\n\nThe sister felt the advice was condescending. Even if the author didn't mean to be, the way they presented it might have come off as judgmental. It's important to respect others' choices, especially in personal matters like parenting. The author might be projecting their own values onto their sister without considering her reasons for returning to work. Maybe the sister has financial reasons, career goals, or other factors that the author isn't considering. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they wish every parent could stay home, but in reality, not everyone can. The sister is in a position where she can, but she's choosing to work. The author's insistence that she will regret it implies that their way is the only right way, which might not be fair. Everyone's situation is different. \n\nSo, even though the author's intentions are good, pushing their views and making the sister feel bad about her choice could be seen as wrong. The line between helpful advice and being judgmental is thin here. The answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because they overstepped by being condescending and not respecting their sister's decision.\n"
