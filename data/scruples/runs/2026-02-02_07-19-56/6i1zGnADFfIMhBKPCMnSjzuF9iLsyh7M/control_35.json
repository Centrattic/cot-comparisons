In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for advising her sister not to return to work after having her baby. The situation is that the sister is going back to work at six weeks, and the author tried to explain the benefits of staying home, which didn't go well. The sister felt condescended to, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has two kids and stayed home for the first year, so they have personal experience. They tried to share their perspective, which is about the emotional and bonding aspects of being present during early milestones. However, the sister didn't take the advice well, feeling it was condescending.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and how advice is given. Even if the author's intentions are good, giving advice to a family member when it's not asked for can come off as intrusive. The sister might feel that her choices are being judged, especially since they have their own family situation and financial support. The author's assertion that the sister will \"regret\" her decision could be seen as dismissive of her autonomy and possibly her own reasons for returning to work, which might include career goals, financial considerations beyond just the ability to afford daycare, or personal values.\n\nAlso, the sister's husband is able to support her financially, so the author is suggesting she should take that opportunity. But the sister might have her own reasons for wanting to work, such as personal fulfillment, identity outside of motherhood, or other factors. The author might be projecting their own experience but not considering the sister's individual circumstances.\n\nThe term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) is a common way people ask for community judgment, often on forums like Reddit. The analysis usually looks at whether the person crossed a line into judgmental or overstepping behavior, even if their intentions were good. In this case, the sister's reaction suggests she felt the advice was condescending, which could imply the author didn't respect her decision-making. The author's belief that she will \"regret\" the choice might be seen as assuming they know what's best, which can be off-putting.\n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the author has a history of close relationship and giving guidance. Sometimes, even well-meaning advice can be delivered in a way that doesn't consider the recipient's feelings. The line between helpful advice and overstepping can be blurry, especially in family relationships where there's a history of support.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but they may have overstepped by assuming their advice was the right approach and by not respecting their sister's autonomy. The sister's right to make her own choice without judgment is a key factor here. The author's intention was to help, but the delivery and the assumption of regret might have been too forceful or judgmental.\n"
