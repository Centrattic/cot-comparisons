In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after childbirth.\n\nFirst, the author is close to their sister and has given her advice. The author stayed home with their kids for a year each and feels that being there for milestones is important. The sister chose to go back to work, using daycare, and the author tried to explain the importance of being there. The sister reacted negatively, calling the author condescending. The author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about boundaries and the sister's reaction. The author is concerned about their sister's decision, which is understandable. However, when someone tells a family member they'll \"regret\" a choice, even if well-intentioned, it can come off as judgmental. The sister might feel that her autonomy is being criticized. Even if the author's advice is from a good place, the way it's delivered might be overstepping. The sister's right to make her own decision is important. The author might not be in the wrong for caring, but the approach could be problematic. The sister's reaction might be valid because she feels her choice is being dismissed. So maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the sister's choice even though they meant well.\n"
