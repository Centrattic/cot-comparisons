In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about not going back to work after childbirth. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they have a close relationship and have given guidance before. They stayed home with their children and are grateful for the financial ability to do so. The sister, who also has the financial means, chose to go back to work at six weeks. The author tried to explain the importance of those early milestones and the risks of daycare, which upset the sister.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention was to share their perspective, which they believe is beneficial. But the sister felt condescended to. The author argues that sharing views isn't condescending, and they think the sister will regret her choice. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, especially close ones like siblings, giving advice is common. However, the line between helpful advice and being overbearing can be thin. The sister felt the advice was condescending, which suggests that the delivery might have been an issue. The author might not have considered that their sister could have her own reasons for returning to work\u2014perhaps personal, professional, or even financial (even if they think they can afford it, maybe they want to use that time for career growth). \n\nAlso, the author assumes the sister will regret her choice, which might not be valid. Everyone's circumstances and values differ. What works for one family might not for another. The author's approach might be well-meaning but could come off as judgmental, especially if it's framed as knowing what's best for the sister's child without considering her autonomy. \n\nThe sister's reaction of telling them to butt out indicates that the advice was unwelcome. Even if the author's intent was good, if it's delivered in a way that the recipient feels pressured or judged, it can strain the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of motive, but the way the advice was given and the assumption of knowing the outcome could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the advice was given in a way that the sister found condescending, and the author is assuming the outcome without respecting her choice. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) since it's their perspective and they care. But I think the main issue here is the sister's reaction and the author's condescension, so A makes sense.\n"
