In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about staying home with her child instead of going back to work. The sister is upset, feeling condescending, and the author thinks they're right because they're sharing their views.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author and sister are close, and the author has given advice before. The sister's choice is to return to work, which the author is trying to dissuade. The key points here are the sister's autonomy and the author's approach.\n\nThe author mentions that they tried to explain the value of being present for the child's milestones. That's valid, but the sister might feel that her choice is being judged harshly. Even if the author's intentions are good, the sister's reaction suggests that the advice was delivered in a way that felt condescending. The author might not have considered that their sister has her own reasons for choosing to work\u2014maybe financial need, personal goals, or a work-life balance. The author's opinion that the sister \"will regret\" her decision is a strong statement and could be seen as dismissive of her choice.\n\nIt's important to respect others' decisions even if you disagree, especially when it's a personal matter. The author might have meant well, but the way the advice was given could have been insulting. The sister's right to make her own decisions about her family should be respected, even if the author thinks the choice is suboptimal. So, the author might be in the wrong because they imposed their views without respecting their sister's autonomy and maybe came off as judgmental.\n"
