In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's sister is going back to work after giving birth, and the author tried to advise against it, saying she'll regret it. The sister got upset and told them to butt out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and sister are close, so maybe the advice was meant to be helpful. But the way it was delivered might have come off as condescending. The author mentions their own experience of staying home with their kids, which is valid, but everyone's situation is different. The sister and her husband can afford for her to stay home, but maybe they have other reasons for returning to work.\n\nThe key points here are the intent and the method. The author's intention was to share their perspective, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the sister felt that the advice was condescending. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the sister's reaction suggests that the message was received that way. Also, the author is assuming that the sister will regret her decision, which is a strong statement and might not be justified.\n\nIn advice-giving, especially in personal matters, it's important to respect the other person's autonomy. The author might be overstepping by implying that their way is the only right way. While it's okay to share one's own experience, pushing it on someone else can be seen as intrusive. The sister has her own reasons, and unless there's a direct harm (like neglect or danger), it's her choice.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for offering advice, but the way it was presented and the assumption of knowing the sister's future regrets might be where they erred. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because the sister felt condescended to, and the author overstepped by making judgmental statements about her choice.\n"
