In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their sister she'll regret going back to work. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to start daycare at six weeks. The author tried to give advice about staying home, using their own experience of staying home with their kids for the first year. The sister got upset and said the author was condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's intention was to share their perspective based on their own experience. But the sister didn't take it well. The key points here are about boundaries and how advice is received. \n\nThe author mentions they've been close and have given guidance before. But even with good intentions, giving advice can come off as intrusive if not asked. The sister might feel that her choice is being criticized, and the author's approach might not have been supportive enough. \n\nThe author argues that they're just sharing their views, and since the sister can afford to stay home, she should take advantage. But every parent has their own situation and reasons for their choices. The author's statement that the sister will \"regret\" her decision is a strong assertion. It implies that the author's way is the only correct one, which can be dismissive of the sister's own reasoning. \n\nAlso, the author's insistence that they don't find it condescending because they know the sister will regret it shows a lack of consideration for the sister's autonomy. Parents have different values and circumstances. The sister might have valid reasons for returning to work, like career goals, financial planning, or personal needs. The author's advice, while well-meaning, might have crossed into being overbearing, especially since it was given without the sister's request.\n\nThe sister's reaction of telling the author to \"butt out\" suggests that the advice was unwelcome. The author might have overstepped by being prescriptive rather than inquisitive. Instead of explaining their perspective, maybe they should have asked the sister about her thoughts and supported her decision if it's her choice. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions were good, the way they delivered the advice and the assumption that their path is better without considering the sister's own reasons and autonomy could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's decision and approaching it in a condescending manner, even if unintentionally.\n"
