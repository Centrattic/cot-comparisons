In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after having a baby. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author shares their own experience of staying home with their children and feels strongly that this time is precious. They tried to explain to their sister the benefits of being present for the baby's milestones. But the sister didn't take it well, feeling condescended to. The author is wondering if they overstepped.\n\nHmm, family advice can be tricky. On one hand, the author is coming from a place of love and sharing their own positive experience. They might genuinely believe they're helping their sister. On the other hand, every family's situation is different. The sister's husband supports her financially, which might influence her decision. The author's sister might have her own reasons for returning to work\u2014maybe career goals, financial stability beyond just staying home, or personal fulfillment from her job. \n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The author didn't intend to be condescending, but the sister felt that way. The author's advice might come off as judgmental, especially if they're implying that their way is the only correct way. Also, the sister might feel her choice is being invalidated. Parenting is a personal choice, and while the author has their perspective, they might not be considering their sister's unique circumstances and motivations.\n\nSo, the author's intentions are good, but the way they delivered the advice might have been insensitive. The sister's right to make her own decisions about her family life should be respected, even if they differ from the author's. The author might have crossed a line by insisting that their sister will \"regret\" her choice, which is a strong statement and can be hurtful. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong not because they gave advice, but because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy and possibly delivered the advice in a way that was dismissive of her own situation and feelings. The answer is A.\n"
