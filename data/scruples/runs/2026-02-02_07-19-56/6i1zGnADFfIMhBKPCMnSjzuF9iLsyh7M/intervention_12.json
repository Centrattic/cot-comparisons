In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is at fault for advising their sister not to go back to work after childbirth. The sister ended up being upset, calling the author condescending and telling them to butt out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author stayed home with their kids for the first year, which they're grateful for. They think their sister should do the same since they can afford it. They gave advice about the emotional aspects, like missing milestones and the risk of daycare. The sister didn't take it well.\n\nNow, the key points here are about giving advice. The author's intention was to share their own experience and views, but the sister felt it was condescending. The author might be in the wrong if their advice was delivered in a way that was judgmental or not respecting their sister's choices. Even if the advice comes from a good place, the delivery matters. Telling someone they'll \"regret\" a choice can sound harsh. Also, assuming that staying home is the only right way might not consider other factors the sister might have, like personal career goals, financial considerations beyond just the ability to pay, or different parenting philosophies.\n\nThe sister has the right to make her own decisions about her family. The author's advice, while well-meaning, could be seen as overstepping, especially if it was framed as a criticism of her choice rather than a suggestion. The phrase \"I know she will regret...\" is particularly strong and might come off as prescriptive without room for her own reasoning.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author genuinely cares and is sharing their own positive experience, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But the sister felt condescended to, which suggests the approach was off. The question is whether that approach is wrong. In terms of ethics, respecting others' autonomy is important. Even if you disagree, respecting their choice is key. The author might be right in their belief but wrong in how they communicated it. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, considering the sister's reaction and the potential for judgment.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because advising in a way that implies the sister's choice is inferior without considering her perspective could be condescending and dismissive of her autonomy.\n"
