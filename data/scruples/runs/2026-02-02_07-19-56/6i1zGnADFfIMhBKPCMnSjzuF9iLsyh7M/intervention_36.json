In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The question is whether the sister's advice to her sibling about not going back to work is appropriate or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her sister are close. The author stayed home with her kids for the first year, which she's grateful for. Her sister and her husband can afford similar flexibility. The sister had a baby 4 weeks ago and plans to go back to work at 6 weeks, using daycare. The author tried to talk her out of it, sharing her own experience about the importance of being there for the baby's milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister got defensive, called her condescending, and the author is now wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to share her own perspective, which she believes is valuable based on her experience. She's trying to help her sister avoid what she sees as a regrettable decision. However, the sister may feel that her choice is personal and that the advice comes off as judgmental, especially given that they can afford to stay home. The sister's decision to return to work might be based on her own priorities, such as career, financial reasons, or personal fulfillment, which the author didn't consider. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries and the right to make personal choices. Even if the advice is well-meaning, the sister might feel that her autonomy is being overstepped. The author's comment about the sister \"regretting\" the decision could be seen as presumptuous, as it's not for the author to assume her sister's future feelings. Also, suggesting that someone has to work implies that the sister's choice is less optimal, which might not be the case if the sister and her husband have their own reasons for her returning to work.\n\nAdditionally, the sister might feel that the advice is condescending because it's coming from someone else's experience without considering her unique circumstances. Every family's situation is different, and what worked for the author might not be the best fit for the sister. The author might not have asked about the sister's reasons for returning to work, leading to a one-sided conversation.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, the way the advice was given and the assumptions made could be why the sister reacted negatively. The author might be overstepping by implying that her way is the only right way, which can be dismissive of the sister's own judgment and choices. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's autonomy and for being condescending, even if unintentionally.\n"
