In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author advising their sister about returning to work after childbirth. The key points here are the author's intentions and the sister's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they've been close to their sister and have given her guidance before. They stayed home with their kids for a year each, and their sister has the financial means to do the same. The author's main argument is that staying home is better for bonding and seeing milestones, and they expressed concerns about daycare risks. The sister, however, felt condescended to and dismissed the advice.\n\nNow, consider boundaries. The author is giving advice, which is common, but the sister didn't appreciate it. The question is whether the advice was condescending. The author's tone in the scenario includes phrases like \"how will she handle knowing...\" which could come off as judgmental. Even if the author's intention was to help, the way it was delivered might have made the sister feel criticized rather than supported.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they know the sister will regret not staying home. That's a strong statement and might imply that the sister's choice is wrong. Everyone has different circumstances and priorities. The sister might value her career or have other reasons for returning to work. The author's insistence that she'll regret it ignores her autonomy and choices, which could be seen as condescending.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's financial situation. Since they can afford childcare, the decision isn't purely financial. The author is suggesting that she should take advantage of her husband's support, but it's her decision to make. The author's right to give advice doesn't override the sister's right to make her own choice, even if they disagree.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for sharing their opinion, but the approach might be. They might not be in the wrong for giving advice, but the sister's reaction indicates that the advice was given in a way that wasn't respectful of her autonomy. So, the answer could hinge on the delivery rather than the intent.\n\nHowever, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the advice was given in a condescending manner, even if the content is well-meaning, then the author could be at fault. The sister's response of feeling condescended to suggests that the advice wasn't delivered in a supportive way. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they crossed a boundary by implying regret and not respecting her choice, despite good intentions.\n"
