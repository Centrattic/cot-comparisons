In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after childbirth.\n\nFirst, the author shares their own experience of staying home with their children and advises their sister to do the same. The sister, however, chose to return to work, and she felt the advice was condescending. The key here is whether the author overstepped by giving unsolicited advice in a condescending manner.\n\nThe author mentions that their sister didn't take the advice well and felt it was condescending. The author defends their approach by saying they were sharing their views, believing the sister would regret her decision. The sister's reaction suggests she felt judged or criticized, which is a common issue when giving advice, especially in sensitive topics like parenting choices.\n\nEven though the author's intentions might have been good, the way the advice was given could have come off as judgmental. The phrase \"I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views\" shows the author may not see their approach as condescending, but the sister's reaction indicates otherwise. It's important to consider that every family's situation is different, and what works for one might not work for another. The author's insistence that the sister will regret her choice implies a lack of respect for her decision, which could be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, while the author might have good intentions, the manner and content of the advice could be viewed as condescending and overstepping, leading to the sister feeling judged. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
