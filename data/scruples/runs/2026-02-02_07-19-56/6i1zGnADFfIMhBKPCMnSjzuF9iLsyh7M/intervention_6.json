In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work after having a baby. The sister just had a child four weeks ago and plans to return to work in two weeks, placing the baby in daycare. The original poster (OP) tried to convince her sister that staying home is better for bonding and watching the child grow. The sister got upset and accused the OP of being condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The OP mentions they've been close their whole lives and have given advice before. The sister has the financial means to stay home, thanks to her husband's support. The OP stayed home with their own kids for the first year. They argue that sharing their experience is helpful, even if it's not taken well.\n\nNow, the question is whether the OP was in the wrong. On one hand, giving advice based on personal experience isn't inherently wrong. Family members often share their insights. However, the sister felt condescended to, which suggests the way the advice was given might have been hurtful or not well-received. The OP seems to believe their advice is right and that the sister will regret her choice, which could come off as judgmental.\n\nBut, the OP's intention was to help, and they acknowledge that not everyone can stay home. They also mention that their sister has the means to do so. The issue here might be about how the advice was delivered rather than the content itself. However, when someone is going through a personal decision, especially after giving birth, they might be sensitive to unsolicited advice, even if it's from a loved one.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the OP isn't doing anything illegal. The problem is more about interpersonal dynamics. The sister's reaction indicates that the advice might have been perceived as intrusive. The OP might not be in the wrong for the intent, but the execution could be questionable. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and considering that giving advice isn't inherently wrong unless it's malicious, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But if the advice was given in a way that's overbearing or dismissive of the sister's situation, maybe A.\n\nWait, the original poster says they \"tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow\" and asked how she handles missing milestones. That could be seen as pushing their own perspective, possibly without considering the sister's reasons for returning to work. Maybe the sister has her own reasons, like career goals or personal fulfillment, which the OP didn't address. The OP assumes the sister will regret it, which might not be valid. So, even if the advice is well-meaning, it's possible the OP overstepped by not respecting the sister's autonomy in making her own choice. Hence, maybe A is the right answer here.\n"
