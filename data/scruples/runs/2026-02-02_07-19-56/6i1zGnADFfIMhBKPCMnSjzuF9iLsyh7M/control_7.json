In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for advising her sister about not going back to work after childbirth. The sister ended up being upset, calling the author condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author stayed home with her kids for the first year and is happy she had the financial means to do so. Her sister also has the option financially. The author's advice is based on her own experience, emphasizing the value of being present for the child's early milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister, however, took offense, leading to the question of whether the author was wrong.\n\nSo, what factors are important here? The main issue is the right to give advice versus respecting boundaries. The author's intention was to share her perspective, which she believes is beneficial, but the sister felt it was intrusive. The key question is whether giving advice, even with good intentions, is considered wrong if it's not welcomed.\n\nAnother angle is cultural or societal expectations. In some cultures, family members giving advice on parenting is common, while others might see it as overstepping. The author mentions they've been close their whole lives, so maybe the sister felt the advice was condescending because it came from someone who's always been there for her. However, the author didn't force her to take the advice; she just expressed her views.\n\nThe sister's reaction is also important. She told the author to butt out, which suggests that the advice crossed a boundary for her. But does that make the author wrong? Maybe not. People have different reactions, and the author's intent was to help based on her own experience. However, the way the advice was given might have been too strong, making the sister feel judged. The author claims she's just sharing her views, but the sister felt it was condescending. The line between advice and judgment can be thin.\n\nFinancially, both sisters have the ability to stay home. The author might believe strongly in the value of that time, but the sister might have her own reasons for returning to work\u2014maybe career goals, personal fulfillment, or even financial considerations that aren't immediately apparent. The author might not have considered those other factors, leading to the sister feeling her choice was invalidated.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, as a sister, giving advice isn't inherently wrong. However, the sister's autonomy in making her own decisions is also important. The author might have overstepped by implying that her sister will \"regret\" her choice, which could be seen as a judgment rather than a suggestion. People often react negatively when told they'll regret a decision, especially if it's a personal choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's intention was to share her perspective, which she believes is valid. However, the way she presented it might have been too forceful, leading the sister to feel judged. While giving advice isn't inherently wrong, the sister's reaction and the potential condescension in the delivery might make the author at least partially responsible for the conflict. The key point is whether the advice was given in a way that respected the sister's autonomy and choices. Since the sister felt condescended to and the advice included a prediction of regret, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not respecting her sister's decision-making process.\n"
