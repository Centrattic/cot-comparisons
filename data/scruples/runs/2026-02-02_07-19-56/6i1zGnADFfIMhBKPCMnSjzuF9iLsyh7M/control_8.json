In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after childbirth. The sister took their advice poorly, calling them condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids and stayed home with them for the first year, thanks to their job flexibility. Their sister and her husband can do the same financially but chose daycare at six weeks. The author is expressing concerns about missing developmental milestones and the risks of daycare.\n\nThe key points here are the boundaries of giving advice and respect for autonomy. The sister is an adult and a parent, making her own decisions for her family. While the author's intentions are good, coming from a place of wanting to share their positive experience, they might have overstepped by being critical or implying regret. The sister felt that the advice was condescending, which suggests that the delivery was harsh or judgmental rather than supportive.\n\nIt's important to differentiate between offering advice and imposing one's views. The author might not be wrong in sharing their opinion, but the way they presented it could have been insensitive. The sister's right to make her own choices, even if they differ from the author's, is crucial. The author's belief that their way is better doesn't negate the sister's right to her own decision. The regret mentioned by the author might be based on personal experience, but it's not a universal truth. The sister might have valid reasons for choosing to work, such as personal fulfillment, financial reasons beyond what the husband can cover, or career considerations.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, the approach might have crossed a line into being condescending and not respecting her autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) for how they delivered the advice, even if their intent was to help.\n"
