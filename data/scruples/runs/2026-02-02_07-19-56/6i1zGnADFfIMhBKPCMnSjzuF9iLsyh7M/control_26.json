In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author advising their sister not to go back to work after having a baby, suggesting she should stay home with the child instead. The sister didn't take the advice well and accused the author of being condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a close sibling, so there's a personal relationship involved. The author's intention was to share their own positive experience of staying home with their kids and warn their sister about the potential regrets of not being present for the early milestones. However, the sister felt that the advice was unwelcome and condescending.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, giving advice is often seen as a way to help, but it's important to consider how it's received. Even if the advice comes from a good place, if the sister felt it was intrusive or judgmental, the author might be overstepping. The key points here are the sister's reaction and the author's approach. \n\nThe author mentions that they sat down and tried to explain their feelings, but the sister told them to butt out. The author might have been projecting their own values onto their sister, assuming that staying home is the best option. However, every parent's situation is different. The sister might have valid reasons for returning to work, such as personal fulfillment, financial reasons (even if they can afford it), or different priorities. The author's insistence that the sister will regret not staying home could come across as judgmental, not taking into account her own choices and circumstances.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"how will you handle knowing...\" might imply that the sister is making a selfish choice, which can be hurtful. The author might not have considered that their sister might have her own reasons for wanting to return to work, or that she might feel pressured in a different way. The advice might be well-meaning but delivered in a way that's not respectful of the sister's autonomy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one making the decision for the sister, but their advice could be seen as overbearing. The sister has the right to make her own decisions about parenting, even if they differ from her sibling's. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they could have been more tactful. The sister's reaction indicates that the advice wasn't helpful in this context, even if it was intended to be.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they gave unsolicited advice in a condescending manner, not respecting their sister's autonomy and choices, even if the advice came from a place of concern.\n"
