In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister against going back to work after giving birth. The sister took the advice poorly, feeling condescended to. The author's reasoning is that staying home is better for bonding and meeting milestones, and they mention their own experience of staying home for the first year with each child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Siblings can have different perspectives, especially on parenting choices. The author's intention was to share their views, but the sister perceived it as condescending. Even if the author's advice comes from a good place, the delivery might have been off. The key here is whether the author overstepped by making their sister feel guilty or judged. \n\nThe author mentions their own situation where they had the means to stay home, but their sister also has that financial stability. However, people choose different paths for various reasons\u2014maybe the sister wants to work for personal fulfillment, career advancement, or other factors. The author's insistence that the sister will \"regret\" her choice could be seen as dismissive of her decision-making. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while sharing advice isn't inherently wrong, it's important to respect others' autonomy. The author might be projecting their own values onto their sister without considering her unique circumstances. The sister's reaction suggests that the advice was not welcomed and possibly came across as judgmental. \n\nSo, even if the author believes they're helping, the way the advice was given and the assumption that their choice is superior might make them in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the condescending tone and lack of respect for the sister's autonomy.\n"
