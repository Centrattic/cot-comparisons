In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about returning to work after childbirth. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to share their perspective about the value of staying home with the child, which the sister took as condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between siblings. They've been close their whole lives, so the author might think they have the right to give advice. However, the sister felt that the advice was intrusive. The key points here are about boundaries and how the advice was delivered. The author mentions trying to explain their own positive experience of staying home, but the sister felt it was condescending. That suggests that the way the advice was given might have been the issue, not just the content.\n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. While sharing personal experiences can be helpful, it's important to recognize that others might have different priorities or circumstances. The author's sister might have valid reasons for returning to work, such as personal fulfillment, financial considerations beyond daycare, or the desire for a balance between work and family. The author's assumption that the sister will regret her choice could come off as dismissive of her decisions.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"you'll regret\" is strong and possibly judgmental. It's one thing to share personal experiences and another to make someone feel guilty for not following the same path. The sister's response of telling the author to butt out indicates that she felt her autonomy was being challenged.\n\nSo, even if the author's intentions were good, the manner in which the advice was given may have been inappropriate. The sister's autonomy in making her own decisions about her family life should be respected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's choice and for delivering the advice in a way that was perceived as condescending.\n"
