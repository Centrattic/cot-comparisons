In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The situation involves the sister using daycare at six weeks, and the author is upset, feeling she's missing out on crucial moments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between siblings. The author mentions they've been close their whole lives and have given guidance before. But when it comes to parenting choices, especially something as personal as returning to work, it's a sensitive area. The sister might feel defensive because her decision is being questioned, especially by someone close. The author's approach might have come off as condescending, even if that wasn't the intention. Phrases like \"she'll regret giving up this time\" and implying daycare providers are \"strangers\" could be seen as judgmental.\n\nAlso, every family's situation is different. The sister and her husband can afford for her to stay home, but maybe there are other reasons\u2014like career goals, financial needs, or personal preferences beyond just money. The author is projecting their own experience (staying home with kids) onto her sister, assuming that's the only right choice. That's where the conflict might arise. Even if the advice is given from a place of care, the way it's delivered could be hurtful. The sister's reaction suggests she felt criticized, which is a common response when someone feels their parenting choices are being judged.\n\nSo, while the author's intent might be to help, the method and the assumptions made could be where they're in the wrong. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because they crossed a boundary by being judgmental and not respecting their sister's choice, even if they had good intentions.\n"
