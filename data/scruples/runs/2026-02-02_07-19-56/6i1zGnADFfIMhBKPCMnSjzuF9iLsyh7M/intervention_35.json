In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is a sister to someone, is advising her little sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The sister is going back to work at six weeks, putting her baby in daycare. The author is telling her that she'll regret missing the milestones and that she should take advantage of being able to stay home. The sister got defensive, called the author condescending and told her to butt out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if giving advice in this situation is appropriate. The author has her own experience with staying home with her kids and is trying to share her perspective. But does that make it wrong to give advice? Well, maybe not entirely, but the way it's delivered could matter. The author mentions that she's trying to explain the feelings and joys of being with the child. But maybe she's being too pushy or assuming her sister will regret her decision without knowing her sister's reasons.\n\nThe sister might have her own reasons for going back to work. Maybe she needs the financial stability, or maybe she has career goals, or maybe she and her husband have a different approach to parenting. The author is making a judgment that staying home is better, but every family's situation is different. The author's approach might come off as condescending, even if that's not the intention. The sister felt attacked, so the author's method of giving advice might not be the right way.\n\nAlso, the author says she thinks the sister will regret it, which is a strong statement. It's possible that the author is projecting her own choices onto her sister, not considering that the sister might have valid reasons that the author isn't acknowledging. Even if the author's intentions are good, the way she's presenting the advice might be overstepping, especially since the sister is making her own decision.\n\nSo, while the author's concern comes from a place of care and wanting the best for her sister and niece/nephew, she might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's autonomy and not considering her sister's own circumstances and desires. The key here is that every parent has different priorities and challenges, and the author is assuming her way is superior without knowing the full context. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
