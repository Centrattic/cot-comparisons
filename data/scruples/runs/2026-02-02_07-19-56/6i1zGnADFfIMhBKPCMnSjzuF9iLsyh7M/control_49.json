In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about not going back to work after childbirth. The sister is going back to work after just four weeks, putting the baby in daycare. The author tried to explain the benefits of staying home, like bonding and missing milestones. The sister felt condescended, so the author is now wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and sister are close, so the author probably has their best interest in mind. But the sister might feel that the advice was unsolicited or not respected. The key points here are about boundaries, the right to give advice, and how it was received.\n\nThe author mentions they tried to share their views, but the sister didn't take it well. The question is whether the author overstepped. Even if the author's intentions are good, giving unsolicited advice, especially on such a personal decision, can be seen as intrusive. The sister's reaction suggests that she felt the advice wasn't her business. The author's statement that they know the sister will regret it might come off as judgmental, which could contribute to the sister feeling defensive.\n\nHowever, the author's intention is to share their own positive experience and the benefits they saw from staying home. That's not inherently wrong, but it's important to respect the sister's autonomy. The sister has her own circumstances, like her husband's support, which might influence her decision. The author might not be considering that the sister's choice is valid for their own family dynamics.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since the sister felt the advice was condescending and the author might have overstepped, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should respect the sister's decision without imposing their views, even if they think it's better.\n"
