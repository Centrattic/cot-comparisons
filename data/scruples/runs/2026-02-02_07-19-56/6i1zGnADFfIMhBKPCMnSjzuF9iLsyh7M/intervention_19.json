In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister to stay home with her baby instead of going back to work. The sister got upset and accused the author of being condescending. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's motivation is coming from a place of caring, given their close relationship and shared financial ability. The author shares their own positive experience with staying home and expresses concerns about missing milestones and risks of daycare. However, the sister is defensive and didn't appreciate the advice.\n\nThe key points here are the line between offering advice and being condescending. The author might have thought they were helping, but the sister felt criticized. The author's statement that the sister \"will regret it\" could come across as judgmental. Even if the intent was good, the delivery might have been too forceful, especially since parenting choices are deeply personal. The sister's right to make her own decisions, based on her circumstances, should be respected. So, the author might have overstepped by implying their way is better without considering the sister's perspective. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
