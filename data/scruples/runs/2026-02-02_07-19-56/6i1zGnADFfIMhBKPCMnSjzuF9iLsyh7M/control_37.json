In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister she'll regret going back to work after childbirth. The sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to return to work in two weeks, using daycare. The author advised against it, citing the importance of bonding and milestones, but the sister felt criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and sister are close, and the author has their own experience staying home with their kids. They're sharing their perspective, which is valid, but maybe the way they presented it came off as condescending. The sister's reaction was defensive, so maybe the author's tone was an issue. \n\nFamily advice can be tricky because everyone has different circumstances. The sister's husband can support her financially, so her choice to work isn't just about money. The author's intention is to share their positive experience, but imposing that view might not be helpful. It's important to respect others' choices even if you disagree. \n\nThe key points are: the author's advice, the sister's reaction, and whether the advice was given in a way that respected the sister's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for sharing their opinion, but the approach could be problematic. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author's actions were giving advice, not forcing a decision, they might not be at fault. But if the advice was delivered condescendingly, maybe they are. The sister's response suggests the advice was taken as judgmental. So it's a balance between giving advice and respecting boundaries. The answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some cultures, family advice like this is common. However, the sister's right to make her own choice is important. The author isn't wrong for sharing their views, but they should be mindful of how it's received. The answer might lean towards not in the wrong, but with a note about communication style.\n"
