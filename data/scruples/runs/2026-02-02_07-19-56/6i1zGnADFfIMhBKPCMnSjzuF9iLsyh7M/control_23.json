In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about staying home with the baby instead of going back to work. They want a simple A or B answer.\n\nFirst, the situation: The sister just had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author, who stayed home with their kids for the first year, tried to convince her that staying home is better for bonding and missing milestones. The sister took offense, saying the author was condescending. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for giving advice.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and the nature of the advice. The author is close to their sister and has given advice before. But this time, the sister didn't like it. The author's intention was to share their experience, but the sister felt it was condescending. \n\nI need to consider if the advice was intrusive. Even if the author's intentions are good, pushing their own choices onto someone else can be seen as overstepping, especially if the sister didn't ask for it. The author mentions they know she will regret it, which might come off as judgmental. Also, the sister has the financial support to make her choice, so maybe the author shouldn't dictate what's right for her family.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to help based on their own positive experience. But the sister's decision is her own, and the author might have crossed a line by being forceful. The way the advice was given\u2014questioning how the sister will handle missing milestones and implying daycare is risky\u2014could be hurtful. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, being in the wrong often involves crossing boundaries or being judgmental without being asked. The author's advice, while well-meaning, might not be their place to give, especially if delivered in a way that's not respectful of the sister's autonomy. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
