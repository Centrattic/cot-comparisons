In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after giving birth. The sister is close to the author and they've given her advice about staying home with the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author stayed home with their own kids for a year and is sharing their experience. They tried to explain their perspective, which might be valid. But the sister didn't appreciate the advice and felt condescended to. The author claims they're not condescending, but the sister felt that way. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respecting others' choices. The author might have intended to help, but the sister might have felt pressured or judged. Even if the advice is well-meaning, pushing someone else's views without considering their situation could be problematic. The sister chose daycare, which is a personal decision based on her circumstances. The author's advice might come off as imposing their own values, even if they think it's for the best. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister's husband can support her, but each family's situation is different. The author might not fully understand the sister's reasons for returning to work, which could include financial, career, or personal factors. It's possible that the author didn't consider these other aspects and focused only on the emotional side. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, everyone has the right to make their own choices, even if others disagree. The author's intention was to share their experience, but the sister might have felt criticized. The line between giving advice and being judgmental can be thin. The sister's reaction suggests that the advice was received as criticism, which could mean the author overstepped.\n\nSo, even though the author's intentions might be good, the way the advice was given and the sister's negative reaction indicate that the author might be in the wrong. The author should respect the sister's decision without trying to impose their own views, especially after being told to \"butt out.\"\n"
