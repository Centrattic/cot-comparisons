In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their sister she'll regret going back to work. So I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to go back to work at six weeks, using daycare. The author tried to explain their perspective about the importance of being there for milestones and the bonding time. The sister took offense, saying the author was condescending. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. Parenting choices can be really personal. The author's intention was to share their own experience, which they found fulfilling. But maybe they came off as judgmental. Even if they meant well, telling someone they'll \"regret\" a choice is pretty strong language. That might have been the issue. The sister felt her decision was being criticized, which could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they have the financial means to stay home, and the sister does too. So maybe there's an assumption here that staying home is better, but not everyone's situation is the same. Even if both can afford it, the sister might have different priorities or reasons for returning to work. The author's advice might have dismissed her reasons, which could come across as condescending.\n\nThe key points are: giving advice that's not requested, using strong language (\"regret\"), and possibly not respecting the sister's autonomy in her parenting decisions. The sister's reaction suggests she felt attacked. Even if the author's motives were good, the way it was delivered might have been the problem. So, yes, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's choice and the tone they used.\n"
