In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about not going back to work after childbirth. The sister is going back to work in six weeks and using daycare, and the author is upset about it, saying their sister will regret it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids and stayed home with them for the first year, which they value. Their sister has the financial means to do the same but chose a different path. The author tried to explain their perspective, which led to a conflict where the sister felt condescended to.\n\nThe main issue here is whether offering advice in this situation is wrong. The author's intention is to share their experience and what they believe is the right choice. However, the sister interpreted it as condescending and told them to back off. Even though the author's intentions might be good, the way they presented their advice could come off as judgmental, especially if the sister felt pressured or criticized.\n\nFamily dynamics can be tricky. While sharing personal experiences is common, it's important to respect others' choices, especially when they have the means to make different decisions. The author might not be wrong in sharing their views, but if it's done in a way that dismisses the sister's autonomy and choices, that's where the problem lies. The sister chose a path that works for her family, and the author's insistence that she will regret it might be overstepping. \n\nIn many cases, people have different values and circumstances. The author's approach might be seen as imposing their own values without considering that the sister might have valid reasons (like career goals, financial planning, or personal fulfillment) for returning to work. The key point is whether the advice was given in a supportive manner or as criticism. The sister's reaction suggests she felt the latter.\n\nSo, even if the author's advice is based on a genuine desire to help, the manner and the implication that the sister's choice is inferior could be where they're in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes) because the author overstepped by not respecting the sister's decision and imposing their own beliefs as if they're the only correct path.\n"
