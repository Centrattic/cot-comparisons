In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about advising a sister to stay home with her baby instead of returning to work. The sister got upset and called the advice condescending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has two kids and stayed home for the first year, which they're grateful for. Their sister is in a similar financial situation, with the husband able to support her. The author shared their own experience and feelings about missing out on milestones and the risks of daycare. The sister reacted negatively, feeling judged.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal choice and boundaries. The author wanted to share their perspective, which is valid, but the sister felt it was condescending. Even if the author's intention was to help, the sister might have felt pressured or judged. \n\nIn such family dynamics, giving advice can be sensitive. Even if the advice is well-meaning, it's important to respect the other person's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong for sharing their experience, but they might have overstepped by implying the sister would regret her decision. That could come off as judgmental. The author's belief that staying home is better is their own experience, but others might have different priorities, like career or financial reasons. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's advice was overly prescriptive or if they respected their sister's right to make her own choices. The sister's reaction suggests that the advice felt intrusive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the sister's autonomy and for making a definitive statement about regret, which can be hurtful.\n"
