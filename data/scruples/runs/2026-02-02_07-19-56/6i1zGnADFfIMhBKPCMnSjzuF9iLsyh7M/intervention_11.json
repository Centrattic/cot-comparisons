In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about not going back to work after having a baby. The sister took the advice poorly, saying the author was condescending. The author feels they're just sharing their experience.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and sister are close, and the author has their own experience of staying home with their kids. They're sharing their perspective, which they believe is in the sister's best interest. But the sister feels criticized or judged, which led her to push back.\n\nThe key points are: Is it wrong to give advice even if it's not well-received? The author probably meant well, but the way it was delivered might have been off. The sister might be dealing with her own pressures and decisions, like financial considerations or career goals. The author's emphasis on regret and the risks of daycare could come off as judgmental, especially if the sister has already made her choice based on her circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the sister's husband can support her financially, which might not be a factor the sister wants to consider. Maybe the sister has different priorities or reasons for returning to work that the author isn't acknowledging. The author might be assuming that staying home is the best choice without considering the sister's individual situation.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, they might not have considered the sister's autonomy and reasons. Giving advice can be okay, but crossing into condescension or implying that the sister's choice is wrong might be where the issue lies. The sister's right to make her own decisions, even if they differ from the author's, is important. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong not because the advice was bad, but because it was delivered in a way that disrespected the sister's choice.\n"
