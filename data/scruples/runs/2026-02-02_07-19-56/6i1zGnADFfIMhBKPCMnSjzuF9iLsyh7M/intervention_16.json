In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for advising their sister about going back to work. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's sister had a baby four weeks ago and plans to put the baby in daycare at six weeks to return to work. The author tried to convince her that staying home is better for bonding and missing milestones, but the sister got upset and called the author condescending. The author is asking if they're at fault for giving advice.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics between siblings. Siblings often have a close relationship and might feel they can give advice. However, the sister might feel that the author is overstepping, especially if they're not in a position where they can enforce decisions. The author mentions they have two kids and could stay home, but their sister made a different choice. The author's intention was to share their experience, but the sister didn't appreciate it.\n\nThe key points here are the sister's autonomy and the author's approach. The author might be right in their belief that staying home is better, but the way they presented their advice could have been perceived as condescending or judgmental. The sister might feel that the author is imposing their own views without considering her circumstances. Even if the author's advice is well-meaning, the sister has the right to make her own decisions, and the author might not have the authority to dictate that.\n\nAnother angle is the sister's reaction. She felt the advice was condescending, which suggests that the delivery was off-putting. The author might not have considered that their sister has her own reasons for returning to work, such as personal career goals, financial considerations, or other factors. The author's focus on regret could come across as assuming they know what's best without fully understanding the sister's situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while sharing one's perspective isn't inherently wrong, it's important to respect others' autonomy. The author might have crossed a line by implying that the sister will regret her decision, which could be seen as prescriptive and dismissive of her choice. The sister's right to make her own decisions, even if they differ from the author's, is a key factor here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intent was to help, but the method might have been inappropriate. The answer likely hinges on whether the advice was given in a way that respects the sister's autonomy versus imposing the author's views. Since the sister felt judged and the author is assuming she'll regret her choice, the author might indeed be in the wrong for not respecting her decision-making process.\n"
