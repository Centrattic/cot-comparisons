In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for advising their sister not to go back to work after childbirth. The situation is that the sister is going to daycare at six weeks, and the author tried to convince her to stay home, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author and sister are close, and the author has personal experience staying home with their kids. The author's intention was to share their perspective, which they felt was helpful. The sister, however, felt condescended to and told them to butt out.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and respect. Even though the author's advice comes from a place of caring, the sister might have felt that it was an overstep. Every parent makes different choices based on their circumstances. The author's sister and her husband can afford to have her stay home, but maybe there are other reasons she's choosing to work\u2014like personal fulfillment, financial goals, or other family dynamics. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong for sharing their opinion, but the way it was delivered could be an issue. Telling someone they'll regret their choices might come off as judgmental. Also, the sister's reaction suggests that the author didn't consider her feelings or autonomy in the decision. The author's advice, while well-intentioned, might have been perceived as condescending because they assumed their way is the right way.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the line is about respecting others' choices. The author's actions could be seen as overstepping by not allowing their sister to make her own decision without pressure. Even if the author's intent was good, the sister's right to make her own choice should be respected. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect their sister's autonomy, even if their advice was well-meaning.\n"
