In this situation, I have 2 children that I stayed home with for the first year of each of their lives, and I'm grateful that I had a job that gave me the ability to do so. My sister and her husband also have this ability financially.\n\nHowever, my sister had her child only 4 weeks ago and has decided to put the baby in daycare at the 6 week mark and go back to work. I sat down with her and tried to explain the feeling of watching your child grow, the joy of seeing them meet milestones, and how fulfilling the experience is. I asked her how she will be able to handle knowing that her child will take her first steps and say her first word away from her, with people who are essentially strangers. On top of that, there's always a risk to handing a delicate infant off to others instead of doing the work yourself and knowing it is done right. \n\nMy sister did not receive my advice well. She more or less told me to butt out and said I was condescending. I don't think there's anything condescending about sharing my views, since I know she will regret giving up this time with her child for a job. If I had it my way, every parent would be able to stay home with their kids, but since someone has to work, she should take full advantage of the fact that her husband is willing and able to support her while she cares for the baby. AITA for giving my advice?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author advising their sister not to go back to work after having a baby, and the sister reacting negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is close to their sister and has given advice based on their own experience. They stayed home with their kids for the first year, and now their sister is choosing daycare. The author is concerned about the sister missing out on important milestones and the risks of daycare. \n\nBut wait, the sister has the financial means to stay home if she wants. The author's advice is meant to be helpful, but the sister felt condescended to. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nI should think about boundaries in family advice. Just because you have a different experience doesn't mean others should follow your path. The sister might feel pressured, even if the advice is well-intentioned. The author's statement that they \"know she will regret it\" could come off as judgmental. Even if the author's intention was to help, the approach might have been too direct or condescending, especially if the sister felt her choice was being criticized.\n\nAlso, the sister's autonomy is important. Parents have different priorities. Maybe she values her career or needs the work for personal fulfillment, not just financial reasons. The author might not have considered that. The advice could be seen as imposing their own values on the sister's situation.\n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, they might have crossed a line by not respecting the sister's decision and possibly being condescending. The sister's right to make her own choice, even if it differs from the author's, should be acknowledged. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting boundaries and for the condescending tone.\n"
