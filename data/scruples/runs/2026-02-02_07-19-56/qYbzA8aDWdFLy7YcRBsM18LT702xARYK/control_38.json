      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author, who's considering taking his daughter to dye her hair against his wife's wishes, is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter is turning 17, so she's a teenager. She wants to dye her hair turquoise/blue for her birthday. The author thinks it's okay because it's temporary and she's old enough to decide. The wife disagrees, thinking it's a sign of rebellion and is worried about what others might think. The author tried talking to her but she's concerned about grades and behavior. The author wants to support his daughter's wishes, so he's considering going against his wife.\n\nNow, the key points here. The daughter is 17, which is a legal adult age in some places, but even if not, she's an older teenager. The parents are co-decision makers, so both have a say. The wife's concerns are about societal judgment and potential negative effects on the daughter's behavior (grades). The author doesn't see the connection between hair color and grades, which is a valid point. The daughter asked if it was an acceptable present, indicating she wanted to involve them rather than rebel.\n\nBut the main issue is the conflict between the parents. The author is taking a side, which could strain the marriage. Even if he believes he's supporting his daughter, he's going against his wife's wishes. Parents usually make joint decisions, especially regarding their children. So, by acting unilaterally, he's undermining his wife's authority and their partnership. The daughter might appreciate the support, but the parent's relationship is also important. \n\nAlso, the wife's concerns might be unfounded, but as a parent, she has the right to express them. The author should ideally find a compromise or resolve the disagreement with his wife first. If he goes ahead without resolving the conflict, it could lead to more issues. The daughter might end up caught in the middle, which isn't fair either. \n\nSo, the author is prioritizing his daughter's wishes over his wife's, which could be seen as not respecting her input. Even if the hair dye is temporary, the action itself is a breach of the marital agreement. Therefore, he's the asshole here.\n"
