She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for taking their daughter to dye her hair despite the wife's objections.\n\nFirst, the daughter is turning 17, which is an adult age. She wants to dye her hair for her birthday. The father thinks it's okay because it's temporary and she's old enough. The wife disagrees, thinking it's rebellion and could affect her grades. The father is considering going against the wife's wishes.\n\nThe key points here are about parental authority and compromise. Both parents usually have equal say in decisions about their children. The daughter asked if it was acceptable as a present, which shows she's trying to be considerate. The father is trying to support her desire, but the mother is against it. If the father goes ahead without the mother's consent, is that violating her role as a parent?\n\nAlso, the daughter is 17, so maybe she should discuss it more directly with her mother. The father stepping in might not be the best approach because it bypasses the mother's input. Even though the father thinks it's harmless, overriding the mother's concerns could cause family tension. The daughter's wishes are important, but the parents usually need to agree on major decisions. So, maybe the father is in the wrong because he's not respecting the mother's role in the decision-making process.\n"
