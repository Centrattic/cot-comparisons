She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for taking his daughter to dye her hair against his wife's wishes. The daughter is turning 17, which is a major milestone, so she's almost an adult.\n\nThe father supports his daughter's choice because he thinks she's old enough to decide and that the hair dye is temporary. The wife is concerned it's a sign of rebellion and worries about people's perceptions, even though the daughter asked if it was acceptable as a present. The father sees no link between the hair color and her grades slipping. \n\nSo, the key points: the daughter is 17, she's requesting it, it's a temporary choice, and the father is trying to support her. The wife's concerns seem more about appearances than actual harm. The father is trying to respect his daughter's autonomy, which is reasonable at her age. The wife's arguments (rebellion, grades) don't hold much weight here. \n\nIs the father the asshole? It seems like he's standing by his daughter's autonomy and supporting her wishes. The wife is being overprotective and projecting negative assumptions. The father isn't violating any rules; he's just helping his daughter celebrate her birthday as she wants. The daughter probably feels supported, which is important for her self-esteem. The father's action is reasonable, so the answer should be B.\n"
