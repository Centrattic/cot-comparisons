She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent who wants to take their daughter to dye her hair for her 17th birthday. The wife is against it, thinking it's rebellion and bad influence on grades. The daughter asked if it was acceptable as a present, so the author thinks she's being reasonable. The wife's concerns seem a bit over the top, like connecting hair dye to grades. The daughter is turning 17, which is an adult age, so maybe she should have more autonomy. The author supports her, but the wife is worried. So, is the author wrong for going against the wife's wishes? It depends on the family dynamics. If they both have equal say, then maybe the author shouldn't do it without agreement. But if they're co-parenting, maybe he's not the asshole because he's supporting his daughter's wishes, and the wife's concerns aren't justified. Also, the daughter asked first, so it's not rebellious. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
