She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent considering taking their 17-year-old daughter to dye her hair against the wife's wishes. The daughter is turning 17 and wants the dye, which the husband supports, thinking it's a temporary choice. The wife is concerned about rebellion, social perception, and potential academic issues.\n\nFirst, the daughter is of age where she's expected to make more independent decisions, especially about her appearance. However, parents usually have joint custody and decision-making responsibilities. If the wife is firmly against it, the husband going ahead without her input might undermine their partnership. Even if the wife is being overbearing, the husband has a responsibility to communicate and reach a mutual agreement.\n\nThe daughter asked if it was acceptable as a present, which shows she's seeking approval. The parents should ideally discuss it together. The husband's decision to go against the wife's wishes without resolving the disagreement might set a precedent where one parent overrides the other, which can cause more conflict. \n\nEven if the husband believes the wife's concerns are unfounded, he should address them respectfully. The daughter's desire is valid, but the parents should present a united front. Bypassing the wife's decision might lead to resentment and affect family dynamics. So, the author might be in the wrong by not fully resolving the disagreement and not respecting the wife's parental concerns.\n"
