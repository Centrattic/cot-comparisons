She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for taking his daughter to dye her hair against his wife's wishes. The daughter is 17, so she's a teenager close to adulthood. The father thinks it's okay because it's temporary and she's old enough to decide. The wife is concerned about rebellion, others' perceptions, and potential negative effects on grades.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 17, which is an age where many parents start giving kids more autonomy. Dyeing hair is a common way teens express themselves, and it's temporary, so the risk is minimal. The father's argument that she asked if it's acceptable as a present suggests she wanted permission, but since the wife refused, he's considering going against her. \n\nThe main issue here is parental authority. Both parents usually have a say in their child's upbringing. The wife's concerns, while possibly overblown, are about the family's image and the daughter's behavior. The father is prioritizing his daughter's wishes over his wife's concerns. \n\nHowever, by going behind his wife's back, the father is undermining her parental authority and could be causing conflict in the household. Even if the action is benign, the method of bypassing the wife might be the problem. The daughter might feel caught in the middle, and the parents' disagreement could lead to arguments. \n\nSo, while the father's intent is to support his daughter's self-expression, acting without the wife's consent could be seen as disrespectful to her role as a parent. The key is whether the parents should have discussed it as a couple first, rather than one parent making the decision unilaterally. The father might not be in the wrong for supporting his daughter, but the way he's going about it without consensus could be the issue. The answer likely leans towards the father being in the wrong because of undermining the wife's authority.\n"
