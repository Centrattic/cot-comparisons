She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent taking their daughter to dye her hair despite the wife's objections. The daughter is turning 17, so she's a teenager, and she wants this as a birthday present. The author doesn't see a problem because hair dye is temporary and the daughter is old enough to make her own decisions. The wife is concerned it's a sign of rebellion, even though the daughter asked if it's an acceptable present. The wife also worries about people judging the family and thinks it'll affect the daughter's grades and general behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' roles and responsibilities. Both parents usually have a say in their children's decisions, especially when it comes to appearance. The daughter is 17, which is an age where she should be developing her own identity, but it's still a family decision. The author is taking her without the wife's consent. Even if the author thinks the wife's concerns are unfounded, going against her wishes could create conflict. The wife's reasons are based on her perception of the daughter's behavior and potential judgment from others. The author might be right in thinking there's no direct link between hair color and grades, but the wife's feelings are valid too. The key point is whether the author should act unilaterally when the other parent disagrees. Since the daughter is still a minor, parents typically co-parent and make decisions together. Bypassing the wife's input could undermine her authority and their relationship. So, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting his wife's concerns and not finding a compromise. Even if he supports the daughter's choice, involving the other parent is important.\n"
