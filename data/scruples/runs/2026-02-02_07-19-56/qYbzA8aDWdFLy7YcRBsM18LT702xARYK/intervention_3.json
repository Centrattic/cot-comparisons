She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent who wants to surprise their daughter by dyeing her hair against the wife's wishes. The daughter is 17, near her birthday, and this seems like a personal choice she wants to make. The wife is concerned about rebellion, grades, and others' opinions.\n\nFirst, the parents are co-decision makers in a marriage. If one parent goes against the other's wishes without consensus, it could strain their relationship. The daughter's desire to choose her hair color is a coming-of-age thing, but parents often have differing views on what's appropriate. The wife feels it's a sign of rebellion and worries about social perceptions, while the author thinks it's harmless and temporary.\n\nThe key issue here is respecting the spouse's opinions. The author is prioritizing the daughter's wishes over the wife's concerns. Even though the wife's concerns might seem unfounded, they are valid from her perspective. Acting unilaterally could undermine the wife's authority and create tension in the family. The daughter's request was made to both parents, and the wife's refusal was part of the discussion. By going against the wife's wishes, the author might be seen as not respecting her role in co-parenting decisions. So, the author could be in the wrong by not finding a compromise or respecting the wife's decision.\n"
