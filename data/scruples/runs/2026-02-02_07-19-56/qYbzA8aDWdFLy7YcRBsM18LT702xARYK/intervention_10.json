She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for taking his daughter to dye her hair against his wife's wishes.\n\nFirst, the daughter is turning 17 and wants to dye her hair turquoise/blue. The dad doesn't see an issue, especially since it's temporary and she's old enough. The wife is against it, thinking it's rebellion, might affect grades, and public perception. The dad's argument is that the daughter asked if it was acceptable, and he doesn't see the connection between hair color and grades.\n\nSo, the key points here: shared parenting decisions, the daughter's age, the wife's concerns versus the dad's support. Since the daughter is 17, she's almost an adult, and her autonomy is a factor. However, the parents are supposed to be on the same page. The dad is going against the wife's wishes, which could create tension. \n\nIs the dad in the wrong? It depends on the parent's dynamic. If they usually agree and this is a significant overstepping, then maybe A. But if the dad is supporting his daughter's wishes and the wife is being overly controlling, maybe B. The daughter's perspective is important too. But the question is about the dad's actions. \n\nThe dad took the initiative without discussing further, which could undermine the wife's authority. Even if he disagrees, the right approach might be to find a compromise or make the daughter older before deciding. So, maybe A because he didn't respect the wife's position. But if the wife is being unreasonable, B. But the scenario doesn't give enough info on their usual dynamics. The default assumption is that parents should collaborate, so skipping that step could be wrong.\n"
