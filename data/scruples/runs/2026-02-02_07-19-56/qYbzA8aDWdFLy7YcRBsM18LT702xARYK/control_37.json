She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for taking his daughter to dye her hair against his wife's wishes. The daughter is 17, so she's almost an adult. The father thinks it's okay because the hair dye is temporary and she's old enough to decide. The wife is worried about rebellion and people's opinions, and she connects it to potential academic issues.\n\nFirst, the parents should be on the same page when making decisions about their child. The daughter asked if it's an acceptable present, so she's seeking approval. If the wife is against it and the father goes behind her back, that could cause conflict. Even if the father thinks the wife's concerns are unfounded, bypassing her might undermine their partnership. The daughter's autonomy is important, but the parents should ideally agree. The father might be prioritizing his child's wishes over the wife's concerns without a good resolution. So maybe the father is in the wrong by not resolving the disagreement with his wife first.\n"
