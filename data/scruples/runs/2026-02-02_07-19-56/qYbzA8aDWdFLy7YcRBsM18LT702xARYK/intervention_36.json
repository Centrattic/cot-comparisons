She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is considering taking their 17-year-old daughter to dye her hair turquoise/blue for her birthday, despite the wife's opposition. The daughter asked if it's an acceptable present, which suggests she involved the parents. The wife is worried about rebellion, family image, and grades.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 17, which is an age where teens start having more autonomy. The author sees the hair dye as a temporary, safe choice and supports the daughter's desire. The wife's concerns seem more about perception and possible consequences rather than the act itself. The author tried to talk it out but the wife remains against it.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If both parents are supposed to have joint custody or decision-making power, the author going against the wife's wishes might be problematic. However, the daughter did ask if it's acceptable, and the author's response was positive. If the wife wasn't consulted properly or if there was a prior agreement, then the author's action could be seen as overstepping. But the daughter's direct question to the parents implies they were involved in the decision-making process. The author might feel that supporting their daughter's wishes is important, especially when there's no evidence of rebellion or academic issues. However, the wife's concerns, even if not fully shared by the author, are valid in a relationship context. Disrespecting the other parent's wishes could lead to conflict. But if the author believes the daughter's happiness is more important and the wife's concerns are unfounded, it's a personal choice. The key is whether there was mutual agreement. Since the daughter asked both parents and the author agreed, maybe the wife wasn't directly engaged. Alternatively, if the author went ahead without considering the wife's stance, that's where the issue lies. It's a tricky balance between supporting a teen's autonomy and respecting a spouse's wishes. In some cases, parents might split decisions, but if there's no prior agreement, the author might be in the wrong by not consulting properly with the wife. However, the daughter's involvement and the author's reasoning could justify the action. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the daughter was part of the process and the author saw no valid reasons against it, but the conflict with the spouse is still a factor.\n"
