She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they'd be the asshole for getting their daughter's hair dyed turquoise/blue against the wife's wishes. The daughter is 17, so almost an adult. The dad thinks it's okay because it's temporary and she's old enough to decide. The wife is worried about rebellion, people's opinions, and grades.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 17, so she's in high school. Parents usually have some say, but at that age, kids do start making their own choices. The dad is trying to respect her wishes, which is good. But the wife is the other parent, so there's a conflict between the parents. The dad is going behind the wife's back, which could cause problems in the marriage. The daughter asked if it was acceptable as a present, so maybe she wanted parental approval. The dad's action might undermine the wife's authority. Even if the dad thinks the wife is overreacting, he should probably talk to her more or find a compromise. Taking the daughter without the wife's consent might be seen as not respecting her wishes, which could hurt the relationship. So the answer might be A, the dad is in the wrong.\n"
