She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for dyeing their daughter's hair against the wife's wishes. The daughter is turning 17, so she's a minor, and the parents have joint responsibility.\n\nFirst, the author supports the daughter's choice, thinking it's a harmless temporary decision. The wife disagrees, citing concerns about rebellion, grades, and others' opinions. The key here is that the parents haven't reached a consensus. Even if the author believes the wife's concerns are unfounded, as co-guardians, they should ideally agree on major decisions affecting their child. Bypassing the wife's objection could undermine her authority and create tension. The daughter's wishes are valid, but parents need to work together. The author might be prioritizing the daughter's immediate happiness over family harmony, which could have long-term effects. So, while the author's intention is good, acting unilaterally might be wrong because it disregards the wife's role in co-parenting.\n"
