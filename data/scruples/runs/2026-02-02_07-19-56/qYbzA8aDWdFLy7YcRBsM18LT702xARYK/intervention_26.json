She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking their daughter to dye her hair despite the wife's objections. The scenario is that the daughter is 17, wants turquoise/blue hair for her birthday. The author thinks it's fine, the wife disagrees, citing rebellion and concerns about grades. The author is considering going ahead without her approval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be a team. When one parent goes against the other's wishes, especially in a significant decision about their child, it can create tension. The daughter is old enough to make some choices, but the parents still have a role in guiding her. The question is whether the father overstepped by not respecting his wife's concerns.\n\nThe wife's concerns might not be entirely rational\u2014like linking hair color to grades\u2014but they are her feelings. The father dismissing her worries could be seen as undermining her authority. Even if he thinks they're unfounded, he should address them as a couple. Also, the daughter asked for permission, indicating she respects their input. If the parents can't agree, going behind her back might cause conflict within the family.\n\nOn the other hand, the daughter's autonomy is important. At 17, she's close to adulthood, and personal expression is part of growing up. The father might feel that supporting her in this way is nurturing her confidence. However, the key issue is the agreement between the parents. Skipping the wife's consent could lead to resentment on her part and set a bad example for the daughter about resolving disagreements.\n\nSo, the father's actions could be seen as prioritizing his own judgment over the wife's, which is part of the partnership. Even if he's right in the sense that the hair dye isn't harmful, the breach of trust with the spouse is a significant issue. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (in the wrong) because he didn't seek to resolve the disagreement jointly before acting.\n"
