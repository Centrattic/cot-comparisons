She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general. (I really don't see the connection.)\n\nI love my daughter and know how badly she wants to dye her hair, so would I be the asshole if I just took her to get her hair dyed for her birthday?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for taking his daughter to dye her hair against his wife's wishes.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 17, so she's almost an adult. The father supports her choice, seeing it as a harmless, temporary expression. The wife is against it for several reasons: she thinks it's rebellion, worries about others' perceptions, and thinks it might affect her grades. The father argues there's no rebellion because the daughter asked for permission, and he doesn't see the link between hair color and grades.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is wrong. The key points are parental authority, the daughter's age, and respecting the wife's input. The father is making a decision without the wife's agreement. Even though the daughter is older, parents usually co-parent, so skipping over the wife's concerns might be an issue. The wife's reasons might seem superficial, but her concerns about family reputation and the daughter's behavior are part of her parenting style. The father might be prioritizing his daughter's wishes over the wife's, which could create conflict and undermine the wife's authority.\n\nHowever, the daughter's autonomy is important. At 17, she's developing her own identity, and the father is supporting her self-expression. The hair dye is temporary, so the risk is low. The father might feel that the wife is being overly controlling. But co-parenting typically requires both parents to be involved. By going against the wife's wishes, the father could be creating division in the household, which might harm the daughter's trust in both parents' ability to support her.\n\nSo, while the father's actions are driven by wanting to support his daughter, bypassing the wife's input could be problematic. The answer might tip towards the father being in the wrong because he's disregarding the wife's role in co-parenting, even if his intentions are good.\n"
