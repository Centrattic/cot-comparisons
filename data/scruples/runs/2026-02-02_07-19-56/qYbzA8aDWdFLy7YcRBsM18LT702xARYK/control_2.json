She thinks it's a sign of teenage rebellion - I told her I doubt that since my daugther asked us if that would be and acceptable present - and is worried people will think she's \"rowdy\" and that our family will look like we have problems. \n\nI tried to talk it over with her, but she thinks it'll result in her grades getting worse and her slacking of in general.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a dad wanting to take his daughter to dye her hair for her birthday, despite the mom's objections.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 17, so almost an adult. She's asking for something that's a personal choice\u2014hair color. The dad thinks it's okay because it's temporary and she's old enough to decide. The mom is worried about rebellion, people's opinions, and potential negative effects on grades. The dad doesn't see the connection between hair color and grades, which is a common argument in parent-child conflicts.\n\nThe dad's reasoning is that the daughter asked if it's acceptable as a present, implying she wanted to check first. But the mom still says no. The dad is conflicted between supporting his daughter's wishes and respecting his wife's concerns.\n\nNow, is the dad in the wrong if he goes ahead against the wife's wishes? Well, in a family, parents usually make joint decisions. If the wife is firmly against it, overriding her could lead to tension. However, the daughter is old enough to have her own preferences, and hair dye is temporary and non-invasive. The dad's argument is valid, especially since the daughter asked first, showing she's trying to follow the rules.\n\nBut the key here is the marital dynamic. If the parents can't agree, the dad going alone might cause more issues. But if the mom is being overly controlling without good reason, the dad is supporting his daughter's autonomy. The question is whether the dad is the asshole here. If the mom is being unreasonable, then the dad isn't wrong. But if the dad ignores her wishes without a valid reason, maybe he is. However, given that the daughter is an adult soon and the dad is trying to support her, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
