Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation is that the father (M49) had a bad day due to the Christchurch shootings, which is his hometown. He's upset and trying to motivate his son to help with chores. The son is 18, in university, living at home without paying much, and is addicted to League of Legends.\n\nThe father asked the son to do chores, but the son was in a game and didn't help. The mother threatened to cut the WiFi if he didn't help, and the son said if they did that, he wouldn't do anything. The father then cut the WiFi, leading to the son yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, kicking over a basket, and damaging the doorframe. The daughter, who has OCD and Aspergers, got caught in the crossfire. The son later fixed the door and washed the car, but the father is now considering further actions like blocking the WiFi or taking away his door.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. First, the father's actions: he shut off the WiFi to enforce responsibility. The son was being uncooperative, but the father's method led to an escalated conflict. The son's reaction was aggressive, which is concerning, but was the father justified in cutting the WiFi?\n\nOn one hand, the father had a valid reason to want his son to contribute. The son is an adult living at home, so expecting some responsibility makes sense. However, the method of cutting WiFi might have been a heavy-handed approach, leading to a violent reaction. The son's response was inappropriate, but the father's action might have triggered it. The father also took away food access, which could be seen as punitive and possibly excessive. The daughter was affected by the shouting, which adds to the stress.\n\nBut considering the son's addiction to gaming and not contributing, the father might feel that the WiFi is a necessary tool to motivate him. However, the immediate cutoff without prior warnings might not be the best approach. The father's actions led to property damage and emotional distress for the daughter. On the other hand, the son's behavior was unacceptable regardless. The father is trying to enforce accountability, which is understandable, but the method could be questioned.\n\nIn terms of whether the father is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. He had the intention to enforce responsibility, but the method caused an explosive reaction. However, the son's behavior was also at fault. The father's actions might be seen as a reasonable attempt to correct the son's behavior, but the consequences were severe. Depending on cultural norms, parental authority, and the age of the son, the answer might vary. Since the son is 18 and an adult, the father's approach might be considered harsh, but not entirely wrong. However, the immediate cutoff of WiFi without other measures might have contributed to the escalation. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with reservations, or A if the father's actions are seen as the trigger. Considering all factors, I think the father's actions were in response to the son's inaction, but the way he handled it led to a worse outcome. However, the son's reaction was his own responsibility. So maybe the father isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer is likely B.\n"
