Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the parent cutting off the WiFi because their son, who's 18 and living at home, wasn't doing his housework. The son was playing League of Legends and got upset when the WiFi was cut, leading to an argument and some damage to the house. The parent then took away the WiFi and later considered taking away the son's bedroom door.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the parent's actions. The parent had a valid reason to be upset about the son not contributing to housework, especially since the son isn't paying for anything except some personal expenses. The parent was also dealing with emotional distress due to a tragic event in their hometown, which might have affected their patience.\n\nHowever, cutting off the WiFi as a punishment might be seen as harsh, especially since the son is an adult. While the parent has the right to set rules in their household, the method and the subsequent escalation (like taking the WiFi without prior discussion, leading to the son's outburst) might be problematic. The parent then took away food access, which could be seen as crossing a line. Also, the son's reaction, including yelling and damaging property, is concerning, but the parent's response in restricting the son's access to the fridge and threatening to remove his bedroom door might not be appropriate for an adult child. \n\nThe son's behavior is definitely unacceptable\u2014swearing, throwing things, and damaging property. But the parent's approach might not be effective in the long run. Instead of cutting off WiFi abruptly and then food, maybe a more structured conversation about responsibilities and consequences would be better. However, the parent's actions were in response to the son's refusal to help, and they were trying to enforce household rules. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's actions might be seen as justified in enforcing responsibility, but the methods used could be questioned. However, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. Given that the parent was addressing a legitimate issue (housework) and the son was an adult who should be accountable, the parent might not be in the wrong. But perhaps the way they handled it was too harsh. However, in such family dynamics, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key points are that the parent had a reason to be upset, but the enforcement method might have been too extreme. However, since the son was an adult and the parent was trying to set boundaries, maybe the parent isn't entirely in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
