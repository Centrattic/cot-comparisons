Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe father is in New Zealand and is dealing with the aftermath of a terrorist attack in his hometown, Christchurch. That's a lot of stress and emotional baggage. His son is 18, in university, living at home, not contributing much to housework. The parents are trying to get him to help, but he's busy gaming. The father confronts him, and when the son refuses, the father cuts off the WiFi. The son reacts strongly with yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, and damaging the door. The daughter with Asperger's and OCD gets upset. The father then threatens to take away the door and is considering tech solutions to block the son's devices.\n\nNow, the user thinks the father is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The father's actions: cutting WiFi is a form of punishment. But the son is an adult, even though he's still in university. The father's motivation is trying to enforce responsibility for housework. However, cutting off internet could be seen as harsh. The son's reaction is extreme, but the father is also in a vulnerable state emotionally.\n\nLegal aspects: In some places, parents can set rules for their adult children living at home, but it's more of a family dynamics issue. The father's actions might be within his right as a parent, but the method could be questionable. Was cutting off the WiFi a reasonable response? The son's response was violent, but the father's initial action might have been a provocation. Also, the son's mental state might be a factor. The father's stress from the mosque shootings could influence his decision-making. The son's addiction to gaming is a problem, but the father's approach might not address the root issue. The father's response (removing WiFi) is a power move that led to escalation. The son's violent reaction is not excusable, but the father's action might have been a catalyst. The father then takes further steps like threatening to remove the door, which could be excessive. Considering all this, the father's actions, while possibly aimed at fostering responsibility, might be too harsh and contributed to the conflict. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The father is trying to enforce responsibility, but the method could be inappropriate. The son is an adult, so the father should perhaps communicate differently. Cutting off WiFi is a form of punishment that might not be fair, especially without discussion. The father's emotional state might also cloud judgment. So, in the end, the answer might be A.\n"
