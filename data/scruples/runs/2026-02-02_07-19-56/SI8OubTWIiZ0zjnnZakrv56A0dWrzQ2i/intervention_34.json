Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent turning off the WiFi because their 18-year-old son isn't doing his housework. The son is in university, lives at home, and plays a lot of League of Legends. The parent feels stressed because of a recent traumatic event in their hometown and is trying to get the son to contribute more.\n\nFirst, the parent's motivation: they knocked on the son's door, asked him to do chores, and he was in a game. Then the parent turned off the WiFi to push him into helping. But the son reacted violently, yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, damaging property, and storming out. The parent then considered further actions like blocking the WiFi for his devices or removing the door.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because the parent escalated the situation by cutting off WiFi, which led to a violent reaction. But the parent might have thought it was necessary to enforce responsibility. The son's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening not to help if WiFi is cut, then acting out physically. The parent's initial action might have been a way to motivate the son, but it backfired.\n\nHowever, is the parent justified? The son is 18 and an adult, so maybe the parent should have found a different approach. Cutting off WiFi could be seen as a harsh measure, especially without prior discussion. But the parent was also dealing with personal stress. The son's behavior is the bigger issue here\u2014he's being disrespectful and destructive. The parent's actions led to the conflict but the son's response was extreme. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent might have overstepped by physically disconnecting the WiFi and removing the access abruptly, which could have been done more calmly. But given the son's history of not contributing, maybe the parent felt it was necessary. The key points are the parent's intent to get the son to help, the son's violent reaction, and the parent's subsequent actions to enforce accountability. \n\nConsidering all that, the parent's actions might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce responsibility, but the method could have been handled better. However, the son's response was clearly unacceptable. The parent's decision to cut WiFi might have been a mistake in execution but the underlying issue is the son's lack of responsibility. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong, but the situation could have been handled differently.\n"
