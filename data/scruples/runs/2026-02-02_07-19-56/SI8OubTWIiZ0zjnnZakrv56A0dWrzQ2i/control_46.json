Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation. The user is a parent (father) in New Zealand dealing with their 18-year-old son who's living at home, not contributing much to housework, and is addicted to League of Legends. The son is in university but only pays for his clothes, bus, and spending money. The father shut off the WiFi after the son was supposed to help with chores but was in the middle of a game. The son reacted angrily, yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, kicking over a basket, damaging the doorframe, and then leaving. Now the parents are worried about his state of mind.\n\nSo the main question is whether the father did the right thing by cutting the WiFi. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the father's motivation. He was dealing with personal grief (49 people shot in his hometown) and was already down. He asked the son three times to do chores, but the son kept putting it off because of his game. The father's action was to cut the WiFi as a consequence. The son responded with anger, leading to some destruction in the house and leaving the parents worried.\n\nNow, considering the son is 18 and an adult, but still living at home. The parents might have a right to expect some responsibility from him. The son is not paying for most of his expenses, so contributing to housework seems reasonable. The father's action was to enforce responsibility by removing the WiFi, which is a common parenting strategy (like taking away privileges) even for adults living at home, especially when they're not contributing.\n\nHowever, the son's reaction was extreme. The father's action might have been justified to enforce chores, but the way the son reacted (shouting, damaging property) was clearly unacceptable. The parents then have a responsibility to ensure their home environment is safe and that the son takes responsibility for his actions. The father's response after the son's outburst\u2014telling him to fix the door and not allowing him to eat the food\u2014could be seen as appropriate consequences for his behavior.\n\nBut wait, the son is now an adult, so maybe cutting off WiFi is a bit harsh? However, since he's still living under their roof and they cover most of his expenses, the parents might have the right to set boundaries. Also, the son's addiction to gaming is an issue that the parents are trying to address. The father's actions could be seen as a way to enforce accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that cutting off WiFi is extreme, especially when the son is in a game and might have valid reasons (though the father's perspective is that he's not contributing to the household). But given the son's behavior post-WiFi cutoff, maybe the father's action was a necessary step to get the son to start taking responsibility. Also, the son's damage to the doorframe and the aggressive behavior might have warranted the father's response, even if it led to some conflict.\n\nIn terms of the parents' responsibility, they might not be in the wrong here. The son's actions were the direct cause, and the father's actions were a consequence to enforce rules. The son's reaction is his own behavior, which the father had to address. The parents might be justified in their actions to maintain order and encourage responsibility in their adult son, especially since he's still dependent on them financially except for certain expenses.\n\nSo putting it all together, the father's actions were a response to the son's refusal to help with chores and subsequent bad behavior. The father is not in the wrong because he was trying to enforce responsibility and consequences for the son's actions. The son's reaction is his own doing, but the father's response was appropriate in setting boundaries."
