Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi when their son was playing League of Legends and not doing his chores. The son is 18, in university, and lives at home but doesn't pay for much except clothes, bus money, and spending. The parent's motivation was because the son wasn't helping with housework, and they were upset about a recent tragedy in their hometown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They tried to get the son to do his chores, but he was in a game and ignored them. The parent then cut off the WiFi, leading to a confrontation where the son shouted, threw an apple, and damaged the doorframe. The parent took away the WiFi again and told the son he can't eat their food if he's going to act out. The son ended up fixing the door later and washing the car, but the parent is now worried about his state of mind.\n\nNow, thinking about the son's age\u2014he's 18 and in university, so an adult. The parent is trying to enforce responsibilities, but the method was drastic. Cutting off internet access is a common tactic for younger kids, but an 18-year-old is expected to have more autonomy. The parent's actions might have been a bit harsh, especially since the son was in a game that he couldn't just quit. That could lead to frustration. The parent's decision to cut the WiFi without discussing it first might have escalated the situation. The parent also took away food access, which is a serious step. The son's reaction was aggressive, but the parent's initial action could be seen as overreacting. However, the parent is also dealing with personal grief from the mosque shooting, which might have affected their patience.\n\nOn the other hand, the son isn't paying rent and isn't contributing adequately to household chores, which the parents might feel is unfair. But the way they addressed it could be seen as authoritarian. The parent didn't give the son a chance to finish the game or explain their feelings. Instead, they immediately shut off the WiFi, leading to a confrontation. The parent's response to the son's anger (taking away food and then the door) seems excessive and punitive. The son's behavior was clearly inappropriate, but the parent's approach might not have been the most constructive. The parent might need to find a balance between holding the son accountable and respecting his autonomy as an adult.\n\nIn terms of the parent being in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. They had valid reasons for wanting the son to contribute more, but their methods were confrontational and possibly too harsh. The son's actions were definitely wrong, but the parent's response might have made things worse. The parent's emotional state due to the recent tragedy could have influenced their actions, but that doesn't justify the approach. The correct answer here would likely be that the parent is partially in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, but the son is also at fault for his behavior. However, the question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong. Considering the parent's actions led to a more volatile situation, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their approach was overly aggressive and didn't account for the son's age and autonomy.\n"
