Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, a parent, decided to cut off the WiFi because their 18-year-old son wasn't doing his share of the housework. The son is in his second year of university, lives at home, and only pays for his clothes, bus money, and spending. The parent was feeling down because of a recent tragedy in their hometown, which might have contributed to their stress. The son was in the middle of a League of Legends game when asked to help, and he refused, leading the parent to shut off the WiFi. This caused the son to react angrily, yelling and swearing, damaging property, and then going out to a friend's house.\n\nThe parent is now considering whether to block the WiFi for the son's devices or take the door away. They're unsure if they're the one at fault (AITA) or not. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess.\n\nFirst, the parent's actions: cutting off WiFi is a form of punishment for not doing chores. The son is 18, an adult, so setting boundaries is reasonable. However, the parent's method might be harsh. The son is in a game where quitting could affect his standing, so maybe the parent didn't consider that. The parent's emotional state due to the recent tragedy might have influenced their decision, which could be a factor in their response.\n\nThe son's reaction was extreme\u2014yelling, swearing, damaging property. That's definitely wrong, but was the parent's action the trigger? The parent took away a privilege (WiFi) which led to a violent outburst. The parent then took away food, which is a bit extreme. The son's actions were unacceptable, but does that mean the parent was wrong to take the WiFi?\n\nThe parent is trying to enforce responsibility. However, there might be better ways to handle an adult child. The son might need to be held accountable, but cutting off WiFi without prior discussion might not be the best approach. Also, taking away food as punishment is problematic because it's a basic need. The parent's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially since the son is an adult. The parent's actions might have escalated the situation instead of addressing the underlying issues, like the son's addiction to gaming and lack of responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent is dealing with stress from the recent events, which might have made them more irritable. Still, reacting by cutting off WiFi could be impulsive. The parent might have a right to set boundaries, but the method and consequences could be questioned. The son's behavior was clearly wrong, but the parent's actions led to a breakdown in communication and safety (damaged property, emotional distress for the daughter with OCD and Aspergers). \n\nSo, considering all factors, the parent's actions might be seen as overreaching, even if the son's behavior was unacceptable. The parent could have handled it differently, like discussing the issue calmly, setting clear expectations, and perhaps using other methods to encourage responsibility without cutting off WiFi, which is a public resource in the home affecting others. The parent's response might have been too harsh, leading to the son's outburst. Therefore, the author might be partially at fault, but maybe not entirely. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Given the parent's actions led to a volatile situation, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted. The parent had a right to enforce chores, but the way they did it was problematic. Maybe A is the answer here.\n"
