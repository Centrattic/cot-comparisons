Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the father (M49) is dealing with his 18-year-old son who's in university but lives at home without paying much. The son is playing League of Legends and not doing his housework. The parents have been finishing chores after dark. The father, who's feeling down due to a tragic event in his hometown, confronts the son about doing his tasks. The son is in a game and dismisses them. The wife threatens to cut the WiFi, and the son responds that if the WiFi is cut, he won't help. The father then unplugs the router, leading to an argument. The son yells, swears, throws things, and the daughter gets upset. The father removes the fridge access and later finds the doorframe destroyed. The son fixes the car later but goes out, and the parents are worried.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. To determine this, I need to consider family dynamics, the son's age, and the actions taken. The son is 18, an adult, living at home but not contributing much financially. The parents are trying to enforce responsibility, especially with housework. The father's action of cutting WiFi is a form of punishment. However, the son's reaction is aggressive and disrespectful, which is concerning. The father's response to remove fridge access (food) is another step, which might be harsh. The son's behavior (yelling, throwing things) is definitely inappropriate.\n\nBut the key point is whether cutting WiFi was justified. The father's motivation was to get the son to do chores. However, cutting off internet access is a significant action that affects the son's ability to communicate and study, especially if he's in university. The son's addiction to gaming is a problem, but the father's approach might have been too abrupt. The escalation to physical damage (doorframe) and the son's subsequent behavior suggest that the father's method might have been too harsh, leading to a worse situation. The father's emotional state (affected by the tragedy) could have influenced his actions, but that doesn't justify them. However, the son's behavior was also problematic. \n\nBalancing both sides: The father had a right to enforce responsibility, but the method might have been excessive. The son's response was unacceptable. The father's actions might be seen as necessary for enforcing household rules, but the consequences were severe. So, is the father in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. However, the father's actions were a direct response to the son's refusal to help. Since the son is an adult, the father might have overstepped in controlling his access to resources. The answer might be A (Yes, the father is in the wrong) because cutting off internet and food access could be seen as excessive, especially for an adult. But some might argue that the father had a right to enforce household rules. Alternatively, the son's behavior was worse, but the question is about the father's actions. Given that cutting WiFi led to a violent reaction and the son's subsequent issues, maybe the father should have handled it differently. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
