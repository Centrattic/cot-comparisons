Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's son is 18, in university, lives at home, and doesn't pay for much except clothes, bus money, and spending. The parents expect him to do housework, especially on housework day. The son was supposed to do jobs like emptying the dishwasher. He was playing League of Legends when his mom asked, and he said he could start. But then, when reminded again, he said he couldn't because he was in a game. The parents threatened to cut WiFi if he didn't help. The son then threatened not to help if WiFi was cut. The author, frustrated, disconnected the router. The son reacted angrily, yelling, swearing, throwing things, and damaging the door. The parents are now worried about him being out with friends and not answering messages.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the son's responsibility, the parents' authority, and the son's reaction. The author's action was cutting WiFi, which is a common parenting tactic to enforce responsibilities. The son's reaction seems extreme\u2014yelling, swearing, throwing food, damaging property. The parents might feel justified in enforcing chores, especially since the son is living at home and not contributing. However, the question is whether cutting WiFi was fair. Some might argue that it's a reasonable consequence for not doing chores, but others might think it's too harsh, especially if the son is an adult. However, the son's age (18) and living at home still under parents' roof might mean the parents have some authority. The son's behavior after the WiFi was cut seems like a major overreaction, which could indicate that the author's action triggered a worse response. But the author might feel that they had no choice if the son was not respecting household responsibilities. The damage done by the son (breaking the door) might also be a factor in the author's justification for taking such a step. The parents later made him fix the door, which is appropriate. The author's motivation included personal distress from a traumatic event (Christchurch mosque shooting), which might have affected their judgment. However, the core issue is whether the WiFi cutoff was fair. If the parents had set clear expectations and the son consistently failed to meet them, then cutting WiFi as a consequence might be justified. On the other hand, if the WiFi cutoff was an overreaction without prior warnings, it could be seen as wrong. In this case, the parents had already warned him that they would cut the WiFi if he didn't help, and he refused to comply, so the author followed through. The son's response was more about the consequence than the initial failure to do chores. The author's action might be seen as enforcing a rule, so the answer could lean towards B (not the author's fault). But some might argue that cutting WiFi for an adult child is excessive. However, given the context of the son living at home and not contributing, and the parents' prior communication, it seems the author is not in the wrong. The son's reaction is more concerning, but the initial action by the author was a consequence for not following household rules.\n"
