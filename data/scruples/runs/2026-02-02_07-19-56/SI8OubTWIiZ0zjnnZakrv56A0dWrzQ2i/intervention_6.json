Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the parent cutting off the son's Wi-Fi because he wasn't doing housework. The son was in a League of Legends game and refused to help, leading to a confrontation. The parent then disconnected the router, which led to the son yelling and causing damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent was dealing with emotional stress from a traumatic event in their hometown. They asked the son to do chores, but he was unresponsive. The parent's response was to cut off the internet, which escalated the situation. The son's reaction was aggressive, including yelling, swearing, throwing things, and damaging property.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is at fault. On one hand, cutting off internet access might be seen as a harsh measure, especially since the son is an adult, even if he's still living at home. However, the parent was dealing with their own emotional state and trying to enforce household responsibilities. The son's behavior was clearly problematic, but the parent's action might have been a reaction to that.\n\nBut the parent's action of physically disconnecting the router led to a violent reaction from the son. Was there a less aggressive way to handle it? Maybe, but the parent might have felt it was necessary to enforce accountability. However, the parent also took away access to food, which could be seen as an extreme step. The son's response was unacceptable, but the parent's actions might have been a provocation, even if well-intentioned.\n\nThe son is 18, an adult, so the parent's authority might be a factor. But since he's living at home and not contributing, the parent has a right to set boundaries. However, the method used (cutting Wi-Fi) might have been too abrupt and contributed to the son's outburst. The parent could have considered other consequences instead of immediately cutting off internet, which is a significant disruption.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both sides have issues. The son didn't contribute and reacted violently. The parent acted in a way that escalated the conflict. However, considering the parent's emotional state and the son's lack of responsibility, maybe the parent isn't entirely at fault. But their action of cutting the Wi-Fi might have been the immediate cause of the conflict. So, maybe the parent is partially at fault for the handling of the situation, even though the son's behavior was worse. Alternatively, since the parent was trying to enforce rules, they might not be entirely wrong.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. The parent's intention was to make the son help out, but the method led to a worse outcome. The answer might depend on whether cutting Wi-Fi was an appropriate disciplinary action. Since the son is an adult, maybe the parent shouldn't have taken that control. So, the parent's action could be seen as overstepping, leading to the son's reaction. Therefore, the parent might be in the wrong for using that method.\n"
