Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's living at home, not contributing much to housework, and is addicted to gaming. The father, who's dealing with emotional distress over a local tragedy, confronts the son about not doing his chores. The son is in the middle of a game and resists. The father then cuts the WiFi, leading to an argument and some physical damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's intentions. He was trying to motivate his son to help with chores, which is a common parenting concern. However, the method he used\u2014cutting off WiFi\u2014might be seen as a form of punishment. The son reacted with anger, which escalated into yelling and physical actions like throwing an apple and damaging the door. \n\nNow, the key points here: the son is 18 and technically an adult, though still living at home. The father's action might be justified in a way if he's trying to enforce responsibility. But cutting off internet access could be a harsh measure, especially without prior discussion. The father's emotional state (due to the mosque shootings) might have influenced his actions, but that's not an excuse for poor judgment. \n\nThe son's behavior after the WiFi was cut\u2014shouting, swearing, damaging property\u2014is clearly wrong. However, the father's initial action might have triggered that. The question is whether the father overstepped. Since the son is an adult, the father might not have the same authority as with a younger child. The physical damage from the son is a sign of poor impulse control, but the father's approach could have contributed to the escalation.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the father might be seen as not in the wrong because he was trying to enforce household responsibilities. However, cutting off WiFi without a discussion, especially with an adult, might be seen as a heavy-handed approach. The son's reaction is also a problem, but the father's actions led to a confrontation. \n\nConsidering all this, the father's action might be justified in the context of trying to get the son to contribute, but the method could be questioned. However, since the son is an adult, the father might have overstepped by using a power move (cutting WiFi) that's more appropriate for a minor. So the answer might lean towards the father being in the wrong (A), but there's a counterargument. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. However, the father's reasoning (son not doing chores, emotional state) might tip it to NTA, so B. Hmm. Need to balance both sides.\n"
