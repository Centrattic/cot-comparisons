Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. They provided a detailed situation where the author cut off the WiFi to get their son to do chores. The son is 18, in university, and lives at home without contributing much. The author felt motivated, knocked on the door, but the son was unresponsive. When the wife threatened to cut WiFi, the son resisted, leading to the author disconnecting the router. The son then yelled, threw things, and broke the doorframe. The author is now considering further actions like blocking his devices or removing the door.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They're trying to enforce household responsibilities. The son isn't contributing, and the parents feel they're doing all the work. The son's gaming addiction is a problem, and cutting WiFi could be a way to enforce responsibility. But the son is 18, an adult, and maybe the parents' approach is too harsh. The author's actions led to a confrontation where the son lashed out, causing damage. The author then retaliated by cutting off food and making him fix the door. \n\nThe son's perspective: He's an adult, albeit still living at home. His argument was that he couldn't quit the game without a penalty. The parents cutting WiFi during a game might have been seen as unfair. His reaction was extreme, but maybe the parents should have found a different way to handle it without escalating the situation. The son's behavior (yelling, swearing, throwing things) is unacceptable, but the parents' methods might have contributed to that.\n\nThe key points: The parents wanted responsibility, but their approach led to conflict. The son's response was violent, but maybe the parents could have handled it differently. At 18, the son is an adult, so cutting WiFi might be an overreach as a form of control. Also, the author's response (denying food, removing the door) might be too punitive. The parents are also dealing with their own emotional trauma from the shooting in Christchurch, which might have affected their judgment.\n\nIn family dynamics, there's a balance between parenting and respecting adult children. The author's actions might be justified in trying to enforce responsibility, but the methods used could be too harsh, leading to a dangerous escalation. The son's behavior is inexcusable, but the parents might have handled it better without cutting off internet or food, which could be seen as punitive and controlling. The author's emotional state due to the recent tragedy might have influenced their actions, but that doesn't excuse the punitive measures. So, the author might be in the wrong for using such extreme actions that led to further conflict, even if their intention was to enforce responsibility. Alternatively, since the son is an adult, the parents might have a right to set boundaries. However, the way they enforced it could be problematic. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether cutting WiFi and denying food are appropriate for an adult child, leading to the son's outburst. The parents might be in the wrong for not handling it in a more constructive way, leading to harm. So, A (author in the wrong) might be the answer.\n"
