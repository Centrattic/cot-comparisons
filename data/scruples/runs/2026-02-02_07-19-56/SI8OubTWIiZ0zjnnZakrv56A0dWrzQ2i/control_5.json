Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves their 18-year-old son who's not helping with housework and is addicted to League of Legends. The father decided to cut the WiFi to get the son to help, which led to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, and damaged the door. Now the father is wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is an adult, living at home, not paying for much except clothes and bus money. The parents are upset that he's not contributing enough. The father's motivation was to get him to do his chores, especially after a traumatic event in their hometown. But the method he used was cutting off WiFi, which is a common parenting tactic, but since the son is 18, maybe that's where the line is crossed.\n\nThe key points here are the son's age and the father's actions. At 18, the son is legally an adult, so parental control might be less justified. However, he's still living under their roof and relying on them for support. The father might feel that setting boundaries is necessary for the household's well-being. \n\nBut the reaction from the son was extreme\u2014yelling, swearing, throwing things, damaging property. The father's response to cut off WiFi could be seen as a reasonable attempt to enforce responsibility, but the escalation suggests that maybe the approach wasn't the best. The father also took away access to food, which could be harsh, especially if the son isn't paying for it.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's behavior was clearly inappropriate. He was disrespectful, damaged property, and affected the family dynamics. The father might have felt justified in taking action to protect the household and set boundaries. However, since the son is an adult, some might argue that the father overstepped by cutting the WiFi and food access, treating him like a child.\n\nThe father is now considering further actions like blocking the router for the son's devices or taking the door away. These steps could be seen as excessive if the son is an adult, but if the son isn't contributing and is causing disruption, maybe the father believes it's necessary to enforce accountability.\n\nI need to balance the son's age and responsibility versus the father's need to maintain household rules. The father's actions might be seen as a last resort after the son refused to help and acted out. While the methods could be harsh, the underlying issue of the son not contributing is a valid concern. However, the father's approach might not be the healthiest, especially leading to a breakdown in communication and the son leaving the house.\n\nIn conclusion, the father's actions could be viewed as necessary to enforce responsibility, but the way he handled the conflict might have exacerbated the situation. Whether he's in the wrong depends on perspective\u2014some might say he was justified in setting boundaries, while others might think he overstepped as the son is an adult. Given the options, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the father was trying to enforce household rules and address the son's lack of contribution, even if the methods were harsh.\n"
