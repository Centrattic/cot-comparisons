Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) who cut off their son's Wi-Fi because the son wasn't doing his share of housework. The son, who's 18 and in university, was playing League of Legends and didn't start on his chores. When the parent shut off the Wi-Fi, the son reacted angrily, yelling and throwing things, and even damaged the doorframe. Now the parent is conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're dealing with teenage issues, like the son not contributing to household chores. The parent might feel that cutting off Wi-Fi is a necessary action to enforce responsibility. The son is an adult, but still living at home and not paying for much except personal expenses. The parent's intention is to get the son to help out, which is reasonable. However, the method of shutting off the Wi-Fi without prior discussion might have been abrupt.\n\nOn the son's side, he's 18 and in university, which might mean he's under pressure from studies and games. He might feel that his parent's actions are an overreaction. The son's anger and subsequent behavior (yelling, throwing things) indicate he felt disrespected or that his autonomy was invaded. The parent's response to cutting off food access after the yelling might be seen as going too far, especially considering the son is still a young adult. The parent also has to consider the son's mental health, as the son might be in a fragile state, especially after the recent traumatic events in the hometown.\n\nThe parent's actions led to a confrontation where the son's behavior escalated. Even though the parent's intention was to enforce responsibility, the way they did it might have triggered a negative reaction. The parent might have other methods, like setting clear expectations or having a discussion about responsibilities, rather than using a drastic measure like cutting Wi-Fi. However, given that the son was uncooperative and had a history of not contributing, the parent might feel justified in taking action to enforce accountability.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's actions could be seen as a form of discipline aimed at teaching responsibility. However, the method might have been too harsh, leading to a harmful conflict. The parent's decision to cut off Wi-Fi was a direct response to the son's inaction, which could be seen as reasonable parenting, but the aftermath (removing food access and the son's aggressive reaction) complicates things. It's possible the parent is in the right for trying to enforce household responsibilities but in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, leading to a breakdown in communication and safety.\n\nAlternatively, if we focus on the parent's right to manage household rules, especially since they're providing a home for the son, cutting Wi-Fi could be a valid disciplinary measure. However, the parent's response to the son's yelling by restricting food access might be crossing a line, as food is a basic necessity. The parent's actions might have been reactive rather than proactive, leading to a worse situation.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, in some places, parents have more authority over their adult children, especially if they're still living at home. But in others, there's an expectation that an 18-year-old should have some autonomy. The parent's actions might be seen as overstepping in a society that values individual rights more. However, the parent's emotional state after a traumatic event in their hometown could also be a mitigating factor, showing that they were under stress.\n\nThe son's mental health is another factor. If he's dealing with his own issues, the parent's actions might have triggered a breakdown. The parent's role is to support the son, not to provoke him. The parent's decision to take away Wi-Fi without considering other consequences might not be the best approach. They might need to balance enforcing responsibilities with respecting the son's autonomy as an adult.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent had a valid reason to address the son's lack of contribution, the method of cutting off Wi-Fi and then restricting food access might be too harsh, leading to negative outcomes. The parent could be seen as in the wrong for not using a more constructive approach to resolve the conflict. However, if the parent's intention was to teach responsibility and the son's behavior warranted disciplinary action, the parent might not be entirely in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the escalation and the parent's subsequent actions, leaning towards the parent being in the wrong could make sense.\n"
