Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a father who shut off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son wasn't doing his chores. The son is in university, lives at home, doesn't pay for much except some clothes and bus money. The father was already feeling down due to a tragic event in his hometown, and the son was playing League of Legends during his chores.\n\nFirst, the father tried to get the son to help with the dishes. The son was in a game and said he would, but didn't. The mother then threatened to cut the WiFi if he didn't start helping. The son responded that if the WiFi was cut, he wouldn't do anything. The father then disconnected the router, leading to the son yelling and swearing, throwing an apple, kicking stuff, and damaging the doorframe. The son later fixed the door and even washed the wife's car, but is now staying at a friend's and the parents are worried.\n\nSo, the key points here: the father's action was to cut WiFi to enforce chores. The son is an adult, but still living at home. The father was dealing with personal trauma. The son's behavior escalated into violence against the parents and sister.\n\nNow, to determine if the father is wrong. In many cases, parents have some authority over their children's behavior, especially if they're still living at home. But the son is 18, an adult. However, the father had a legitimate reason to be upset\u2014his son wasn't contributing, especially after the father was already struggling emotionally. The father's action, while perhaps extreme, was an attempt to enforce responsibility. The son's reaction was aggressive and destructive, which is clearly wrong. The father's response to take away WiFi seems like a reasonable disciplinary measure given the context, especially considering the son's addiction to gaming. However, the father also took away the food and the door, which might be harsh for an adult. But the son's behavior justified some level of consequence. The father's actions were in response to the son's initial non-compliance and the subsequent aggression. The father's intention was to get the son to help out and learn responsibility. The parents are worried about the son's state of mind, but the father's actions were a reaction to the son's behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the father's actions were in response to the son's lack of responsibility and the escalation of conflict. The father's intent was to enforce chores and set boundaries. The son's aggression and refusal to help were problems. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But maybe some might argue that cutting WiFi for an adult is overstepping, but given the context, it's understandable. The answer is likely B (Not the author's fault).\n"
