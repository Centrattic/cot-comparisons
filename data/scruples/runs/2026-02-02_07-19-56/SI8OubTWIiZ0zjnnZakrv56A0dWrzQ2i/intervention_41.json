Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The story is about a father who shut off the WiFi because his son wasn't doing his chores. The son is 18, in university, lives at home, and is addicted to League of Legends. The father was feeling down because of a recent tragedy in his hometown. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's actions. He went to the router and physically disconnected the power cable, which caused the son to react angrily. The son started yelling and swearing, then threw an apple and kicked over a washing basket. The daughter with OCD and Aspergers was affected, and the son damaged the doorframe. The father then told the son he had to fix it, and the son eventually washed the wife's car but left for a friend's place.\n\nThe user thinks the father is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The father's intent was to enforce responsibility by cutting WiFi, which he saw as necessary because the son wasn't contributing to chores. However, the son's reaction was extreme. The question is whether the father's approach was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of parenting an 18-year-old, who is an adult, the father might be trying to set boundaries. But the method of cutting off WiFi abruptly and then reacting to the son's anger by restricting food might have been too harsh. The son's addiction to gaming could be a factor; the father didn't consider the son's emotional state or the game's nature (can't quit mid-game). The son's outburst and damage were a reaction to the sudden loss of internet and the father's response about food. \n\nThe father's actions might have escalated the situation. Instead of a calm approach, like discussing the chores and consequences beforehand, he acted impulsively. The son's behavior was inappropriate, but the father's response could have been more constructive. The son is an adult, so the father should perhaps focus on communication rather than authoritarian measures.\n\nHowever, the father was dealing with his own emotional state due to the recent tragedy, which might have affected his judgment. The son's refusal to help and the prior agreement about chores could justify the father's frustration. Still, the way he handled it\u2014cutting WiFi and then cutting off food\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially causing distress to the daughter with special needs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The father had a legitimate concern about household responsibilities, but his method of enforcement led to a conflict. The son's reaction was extreme, but the father's response to the yelling by revoking food access might be seen as overstepping, as the son is living at home and food is a basic need. Taking away food as punishment could be considered inhumane or excessive.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is an adult and should be held accountable. However, the father's approach could have been more measured. The damage to the doorframe and the son's planned drinking might be a result of the father's actions. The wife was worried, indicating that the situation might have been too intense.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the father's actions might be seen as a harsh response that didn't account for the son's circumstances and could have been handled more calmly. The son's behavior was wrong, but the father's method of confrontation might be in the wrong too. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
