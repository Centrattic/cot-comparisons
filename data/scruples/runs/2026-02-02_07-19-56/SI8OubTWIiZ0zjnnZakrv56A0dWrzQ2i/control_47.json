Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author (M49) and his wife are dealing with their kids not doing enough housework, especially on housework day. Their son is 18, in his second year of university, and lives at home without paying for anything except clothes, bus money, and spending. The son is addicted to League of Legends, which probably affects his productivity.\n\nThe situation happened on a Saturday morning. The author starts feeling down because of the recent mosque shootings in Christchurch, his hometown. He knocks on the son's door at 9:30 AM to ask him to do his jobs and empty the dishwasher. The son is in a game and says \"yeah yeah\" but doesn't act. An hour later, the wife checks again, and the son is still in a game. He was threatened with cutting the WiFi, but the son said if they did that, he wouldn't help. The author then disconnects the WiFi, leading to the son yelling and swearing. The son's actions escalate, including throwing an apple, kicking over a washing basket, damaging the coffee table, and destroying the doorframe with repeated slamming. The author tells him to fix the door and later sends the wife to take him to work, where he plans to go to a friend's and possibly get drunk. Now the wife is worried because he's not responding and in a bad state.\n\nThe author is contemplating whether to block the son's devices from the WiFi or remove his bedroom door. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal and moral standpoint, the son is 18, an adult, but still living at home. Parents have some responsibility until the child is independent, but the son is not contributing much beyond what he's being asked. The author's motivation includes his son's neglect of chores and the son's addiction to gaming. However, the emotional context of the father, who is dealing with trauma from the recent shootings in his hometown, is significant. The son's reaction was aggressive and disrespectful, potentially harming the 11-year-old daughter with OCD and Asperger's, which is concerning.\n\nThe father's actions included cutting off WiFi, which is a common parenting strategy to encourage responsibility, but when the son escalated with violence, the father's response to make him fix the damage and enforce consequences seems reasonable. The son's behavior was clearly inappropriate, but the father's initial action (cutting WiFi) might be seen as necessary. The more contentious part is the father's decision to take away food access and enforce fixing the door. However, in the context of the son's aggressive actions, the father had the right to set boundaries, especially to protect the daughter. The son's retaliation seems to cross the line, and the father's response is about enforcing consequences for the damage done.\n\nConsidering the son's age, the father's emotional state, and the son's disrespectful behavior, including the threat of not helping if deprived of internet, the father's actions might be justified as a parent trying to teach accountability. However, completely cutting off WiFi and food access for an adult child could be seen as harsh. But given the son's actions, it's a response to protect the family and maintain order. The author might not be in the wrong because the son's behavior was unacceptable, and the parent's actions were a response to that. The key points are: the son's refusal to help, the father's emotional context, the son's aggressive response, and the consequences the father imposed. The father's actions were a form of discipline, but the son's escalation makes the father's stance understandable. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
