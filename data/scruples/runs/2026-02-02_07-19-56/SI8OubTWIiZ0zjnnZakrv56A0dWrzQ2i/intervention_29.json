Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They shut off the WiFi to get their son to do chores, but the son reacted aggressively. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, the context: the son is 18, in university, living at home without paying much. The parents are upset he's not contributing. On a sensitive Saturday, after a traumatic event in the user's hometown, they ask him to do chores. He's in a game and ignores them. The wife threatens to cut WiFi, he says he won't work if they do. The author then cuts the WiFi, leading to a shouting match, and the son destroys the doorframe.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Was cutting off WiFi an appropriate action? The son is an adult, but still a dependent. Parents have a responsibility to set boundaries, but methods matter. Cutting off internet access as a punishment might be seen as harsh, especially if it's not a pre-established consequence. The son's reaction was extreme, but the parents' action might have escalated the situation. The son's mental state and possible addiction to gaming could be factors. However, the parents' motivation was to get him to help with chores, which is a reasonable expectation. The destruction of property by the son is a serious issue. The parents' actions might be justified as a last resort, but the immediate removal of WiFi without warning could have been handled differently. However, considering the son's age and responsibility, there's a balance between being a parent and respecting an adult child's autonomy. The parents might be in the right in setting consequences, but the approach could have been better. Alternatively, the son's overreaction and aggression make the parents' actions seem more defensible. Hmm. I think the parents are trying to enforce responsibility, but their method might be too extreme. However, given the son's behavior, it's a complex situation. The answer could swing either way. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe the community would say A or B. I'm leaning towards B (No) because the parents were trying to enforce chores, but maybe cutting off WiFi was too harsh. However, the son's aggressive response complicates it. Wait, the parents are in New Zealand, and they're dealing with a son who's not contributing. The son's addiction and refusal to help led to the conflict. The parents might be justified in their actions. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Another angle: cutting off internet access for an adult child could be seen as controlling. However, since they live under the same roof, parents can set household rules. The immediate disconnection without prior discussion might have been hasty, but the threat from the wife was already there. The son's reaction is his responsibility. So maybe B (No).\n"
