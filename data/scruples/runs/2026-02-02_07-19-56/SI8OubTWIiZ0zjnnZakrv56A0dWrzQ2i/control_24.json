Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The scenario involves an 18-year-old son who's a university student living at home, not contributing much to housework, and being addicted to League of Legends. The father, who's dealing with emotional distress from a recent tragedy in his hometown, decided to cut the WiFi because the son wasn't helping out. The son reacted aggressively, yelling, swearing, destroying property, and the father then banned him from eating his food.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the father's actions. He was trying to enforce household responsibilities, which is a parent's role. However, the son is 18, an adult. The father might have overstepped by cutting off WiFi without discussing it, especially since the son is in university and relies on internet for studies. But the father's intention was to make him do chores. However, the method was harsh. Cutting WiFi could disrupt the son's academic work, which might be a problem. The father also took away food access, which is a more severe punishment. The son's reaction was violent, but the father's actions might have contributed to the escalation.\n\nNow, considering the son's behavior: he was disrespectful, aggressive, and destructive. The father's initial action was to enforce responsibility, but the follow-up (denying food) could be seen as punitive beyond a parent's rights, especially since the son is an adult. The father might have crossed a line by restricting food, which is necessary for basic needs. Also, taking away the door if it's part of the home might not be feasible. \n\nThe father's emotional state due to the mosque shootings might affect his judgment, but that doesn't excuse harsh punishment. However, the son's behavior was unacceptable. The question is whether the father's actions were proportionate. Cutting WiFi could be justified for chores, but banning food is too much. So, the father might be partly in the wrong for the food ban but not entirely. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong overall, the answer depends on whether the actions were reasonable. \n\nIn some contexts, parents have control over household rules, but once the child is an adult, certain actions might be excessive. The father's response was to enforce chores, which is reasonable, but the punishment (taking food away) is not. So, the father might be in the wrong for the food part, not the WiFi. But the main question is about shutting off WiFi. That's more about enforcing chores. However, the son is an adult, and the father's decision might interfere with his university work. If the son isn't paying for his internet, the father can control it. But if the son is a student, cutting internet could impact his studies. \n\nConsidering all factors, the father's action of cutting WiFi is a matter of enforcing household duties, which is a parent's right. However, the subsequent denial of food is crossing a line. Since the question is about the WiFi, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) for that specific action. However, the overall situation is complex. But the user is focusing on the initial action of cutting WiFi. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would likely be B, as enforcing chores is within parental rights, but the follow-up actions might be problematic. However, the initial act of disconnecting WiFi to enforce chores is not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
