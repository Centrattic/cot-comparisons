Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong after cutting off the WiFi and causing a conflict with his son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a parent who is upset because their 18-year-old son isn't contributing enough to household chores. The son is in university, lives at home, and doesn't pay for much except clothes and bus fare. The parents are feeling down due to recent events in their hometown, which adds to their stress. The son is playing League of Legends and not doing his chores. The parents try to get him to help, but he refuses, and they cut the WiFi. This leads to the son yelling, swearing, throwing things, damaging the door, and then the parents send him to his friend's house. The parents are now worried about him.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's accurate. The key points here are the actions taken by the parents and the son's reaction. \n\nThe parents' actions: they cut off WiFi without prior discussion or compromise. The son was in the middle of a game, which he mentioned would result in penalties. The parents' motivation was to enforce responsibility. However, cutting off the WiFi abruptly led to an escalation. The son's response was aggressive, involving yelling, swearing, and property damage. \n\nThe parents then took further actions by refusing to let him eat their food, which might be seen as cutting off basic needs. The son's reaction is understandable if he feels his autonomy is being stripped, especially since he's 18 and transitioning to adulthood. However, his behavior was disrespectful and damaging. \n\nThe parents might argue that they were enforcing rules and trying to teach responsibility. But their method of cutting off WiFi without considering the son's position (he's a university student, perhaps reliant on internet for school) could be problematic. Also, the immediate removal without giving him a chance to finish his game might have been harsh, especially if he had valid reasons. \n\nThe son's response was inappropriate, but the parents' approach might have contributed to the conflict. At 18, the son is an adult, and his actions should be addressed with some level of respect for his independence. The parents' actions might come across as authoritarian, leading to the son's emotional outburst. \n\nHowever, the parents are also dealing with stress from recent traumatic events, which could affect their judgment. They might feel overwhelmed and trying to manage household responsibilities while dealing with their own emotions. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parents are trying to enforce responsibility, which is reasonable. However, their methods may have been too extreme, leading to a breakdown in communication and escalation of conflict. The son's behavior was definitely wrong, but the parents could have handled it differently to avoid the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they acted to enforce household rules, which is a parent's role. On the other hand, their actions led to a violent response and damaged relationships. The line between discipline and overreaction is thin here. The parents might not be in the wrong for trying to teach responsibility, but their method could be questionable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the parents overstepped by cutting off WiFi without considering the son's circumstances. If the son's gaming is a legitimate issue affecting his chores, then the parents have a point. But their approach might have been too harsh. The son's age and independence should be considered. The parents could have set boundaries with more communication rather than abrupt actions. \n\nGiven that the son is 18 and an adult, the parents might need to adjust their approach to foster maturity rather than impose strict controls. However, they are still responsible for setting expectations. The conflict here is about balancing accountability with respect for the son's autonomy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might share some responsibility for the situation by not using a more measured approach. But the son's actions were definitely inappropriate. The answer might be that the author is partially at fault, but the options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A. However, I need to decide based on the analysis. The parents' actions led to a worse outcome, but they were acting out of frustration. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because their method could have been handled better to prevent the conflict.\n"
