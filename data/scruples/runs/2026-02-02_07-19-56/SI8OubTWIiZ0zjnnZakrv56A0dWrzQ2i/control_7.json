Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) who shut off the WiFi because their 18-year-old son wasn't doing his housework. The son was in the middle of a League of Legends game. The author felt it was time to enforce responsibility since the son is living at home without contributing much except for his own expenses. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the son isn't doing enough around the house, especially on housework day. The parents are doing the work after dark, and the son is addicted to video games. The parents had given him chances, and when he didn't comply, they threatened to cut the WiFi. The author then actually did that, leading to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, threw an apple, and damaged the doorframe. The parents had to send the daughter to her room and later the son left in a bad state.\n\nNow, the author is questioning if they're in the wrong. The key factors here are about the son's age, responsibility, and the parents' approach. The son is 18 and in university, so he's considered an adult. However, he's still living at home and not contributing adequately. The parents are trying to enforce chores, which is a common parenting strategy, especially when kids are living at home. \n\nThe author's action was cutting the WiFi, which is a form of punishment. However, the son reacted aggressively. The question is whether the author overstepped by cutting the WiFi without a prior discussion or a more measured approach. Also, the son's reaction (yelling, swearing, damaging property) suggests that the situation escalated beyond the initial conflict. The parents might have expected some resistance, but the level of aggression from the son complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parents have a right to set boundaries for their son, especially if he's not fulfilling his responsibilities. However, cutting off WiFi entirely might be seen as a drastic measure, even if it's a common strategy. The author could have considered other methods first, like setting specific times for chores versus gaming, or having a more structured system. That said, the son's behavior in the aftermath was clearly inappropriate, and the parents did attempt to address the issue.\n\nThe son's addiction to gaming is a separate issue that might need professional help, but the parents are trying to enforce responsibility through household chores. The author's actions might be justified as part of enforcing those responsibilities, but the method could be questioned. However, considering the son's reaction, it's possible that the author's approach was necessary to stop the pattern of neglect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's method might be debatable, the core issue is about enforcing responsibility in an adult child. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for taking action when the son repeatedly failed to meet expectations. The son's subsequent behavior is his own responsibility, but the parents have a right to set boundaries. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
