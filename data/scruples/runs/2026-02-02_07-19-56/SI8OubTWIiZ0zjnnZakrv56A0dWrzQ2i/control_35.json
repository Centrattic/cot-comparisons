Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent dealing with their 18-year-old son who isn't helping with housework and is addicted to gaming. The parent turned off the WiFi after the son refused to help, leading to an argument and some destructive behavior from the son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They were trying to enforce responsibility, which is a common parental role. The son is still living at home, not paying for much, and not contributing as expected. The parent had a valid reason for being upset\u2014personal connection to the mosque shootings, which might have affected their mood. \n\nThe parent approached the son to do chores, but the son was in a game and dismissed them. The wife threatened to cut the WiFi, which the son resisted. The parent then disconnected the router. The son reacted with anger, yelling, swearing, throwing things, and damaging the door. The parent took away the food access and later asked the son to fix the door.\n\nNow, evaluating if the parent is in the wrong. The parent's intention was to enforce responsibility and set boundaries. However, cutting off WiFi abruptly might have been a harsh reaction, especially without prior discussion. The son's reaction was extreme, but the parent's action was a form of punishment. However, the parent's actions were in response to the son's refusal to help and disrespectful behavior. \n\nThe parent did attempt to communicate calmly and later tried to enforce consequences for the son's actions. At 18, the son is an adult, but still living at home, so parents might still have some authority. The parent's actions were within their rights as a parent trying to manage household responsibilities. The son's behavior was clearly inappropriate and disrespectful, so the parent's response, while strict, was a reaction to that behavior.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Cutting WiFi might be seen as overstepping, but given the son's prior behavior, it's a reasonable attempt to enforce responsibility. The parent also tried to set other boundaries, like food access. The damage to the door would need to be addressed, but the parent's requirement to fix it is fair. The parent is concerned about the son's well-being, showing they care despite the conflict.\n\nOverall, the parent's actions were a response to the son's failure to contribute and disrespectful behavior. While the method might be debated, the intent was to correct the son's behavior and enforce household rules. The parent isn't in the wrong here.\n"
