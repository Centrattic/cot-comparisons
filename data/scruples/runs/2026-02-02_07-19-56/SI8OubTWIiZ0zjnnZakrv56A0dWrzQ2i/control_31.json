Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. So, first, I need to understand the scenario.\n\nThe author is a parent (M49) from New Zealand. Their son is 18, a second-year university student living at home. The son isn't contributing much to housework and is addicted to League of Legends. On a Saturday, the parent decides to shut off the WiFi because the son was ignoring requests to do chores. The son was in the middle of a game and threatened to not help if the WiFi was cut. The parent then disconnects the router, leading to an argument and the son yelling, swearing, and causing damage. The son later fixed the car and went to a friend's, but the parents are worried about his state of mind.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They asked their son to do chores multiple times. The son was unresponsive and made a threat about not helping if WiFi was cut. The parent then cut the WiFi, which led to an escalation. The son's reaction was aggressive, including yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, damaging a door. The parent then told the son to fix the door, and later the son did help with washing the car.\n\nIs cutting the WiFi an unreasonable action? The parent was dealing with a teenager who isn't contributing to household responsibilities. The parent might feel that using WiFi as a consequence is a way to enforce responsibility. However, the son is 18, an adult, so the parent's approach might be seen as overstepping or using excessive force. But the parent's intention was to enforce chores, which is part of family responsibilities.\n\nThe son's reaction is extreme. He was in a game and perhaps felt the parent's action was unfair. The parent might have expected a discussion, but the son reacted with aggression. The parent's response to stop providing food is a bit harsh, but it's a consequence for the son's behavior. The parent then allows the son to leave, and the son later helps with the car, indicating some resolution.\n\nThe parent is worried about the son's well-being, which shows concern. The parent's actions were a response to the son's refusal to help and subsequent aggression. The parent might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce household rules. However, some might argue that cutting off WiFi abruptly without prior discussion is too harsh, especially for an adult son. But given the context of the son not contributing and the parent's stress (due to the mosque shootings in Christchurch), it's a complex situation.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent's actions, while strict, were in response to the son's neglect of responsibilities and aggressive reaction. The parent is trying to maintain household order, and the son's behavior was inappropriate. The parent might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
