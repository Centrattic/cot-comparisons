Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a father (M49) who shut off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son wasn't doing his housework. The son is in university, lives at home, and doesn't contribute much except for his own expenses. The father was already feeling down due to a tragic event in his hometown. \n\nThe son was in the middle of a game of League of Legends when the father asked him to do chores. The son ignored the request, leading to the father cutting off the WiFi. The son then got very angry, yelled, swore, threw an apple, kicked over a basket, and damaged the doorframe. The father took away his food and made him fix the door. The son later washed the car and left for a friend's, possibly drinking. The parents are now worried about his state of mind.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the father was in the wrong. Let's break it down. The father's actions were in response to the son not doing his chores and being uncooperative. However, the son is 18, an adult, living at home but not paying for much. The father's decision to cut off WiFi could be seen as a disciplinary measure, but the son's reaction was extreme\u2014shouting, throwing things, damaging property. \n\nNow, considering the father's perspective: he was trying to enforce responsibility. The son's initial refusal and the threat not to work if WiFi was cut off might be seen as manipulative. The father acted to enforce the chore, but the son's aggressive response escalated the situation. The father then took away food access, which could be harsh, but maybe intended to teach accountability.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's actions might have been a bit over the top. Cutting off WiFi is a strong move, especially knowing that the son's game is important. The father's response to the son's outburst by cutting off food access might not be the best approach, as it could be seen as punitive without a clear connection to the behavior. Also, the son's mental state (as a university student, possibly stressed) and the daughter's sensitivity to conflict might mean the father should have handled it differently.\n\nBut considering the son's actions\u2014yelling, swearing, throwing objects, damaging property\u2014his behavior was definitely inappropriate. The father's actions were a response to that, though the aftermath shows the son might have overreacted, leading to further issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father tried to address the son's lack of responsibility, which is a parent's role. However, the method might not have been the best. The son's reaction was clearly wrong, but the father's escalation (taking away food) might cross a line. However, given the context of the son's age and the situation, it's a complex scenario. The father might not be entirely wrong, but perhaps could have handled it more constructively. But according to the options given, the answer is either A or B. Since the son's behavior was worse, and the father was trying to enforce responsibility, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the father's cutting off food access might be questionable. However, given the son's prior behavior and the context, the father's actions are understandable as a parent trying to enforce accountability. So leaning towards B.\n"
