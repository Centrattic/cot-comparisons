Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the original post is in the wrong. Let me start by rereading the situation to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user is a parent (M49) in New Zealand. They have an 18-year-old son who's in university but lives at home without paying for anything except clothes, bus money, and spending. The son is addicted to League of Legends. On a Saturday, the parent tried to get the son to do housework after a difficult day due to the mosque shootings in Christchurch. The son was in a game and didn't start helping. The parent's wife threatened to cut the WiFi if he didn't help, but the son said he wouldn't do anything if they did that. The parent then cut the WiFi, leading to the son yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, kicking a basket, and damaging the doorframe. The parent then told him to fix the door and later considered taking away his WiFi access or the bedroom door. The son ended up washing the wife's car and left, but the parents are worried about his state of mind.\n\nThe user is asking if they are in the wrong (AITA). The user thinks they are in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nNow, I need to analyze whether the parent's actions were justified. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the son is 18 and an adult. In many places, 18 is the age of majority, so he's legally an adult. However, he's living at home and not contributing financially except for some expenses. The parents expect him to help with housework, which is reasonable. The son is described as being addicted to gaming, which might be interfering with his responsibilities.\n\nThe parents' approach was to shut off the WiFi as a way to enforce housework. The son was in the middle of a game, which he couldn't quit without a penalty. The parent then cut the WiFi, leading to a confrontation. The son's reaction was aggressive: yelling, swearing, throwing objects, and damaging property. The parent then told him he couldn't eat their food anymore, leading to more conflict. The son then damaged the doorframe.\n\nThe parent is now considering further actions like blocking the son's devices from the router or removing the bedroom door. The parents are worried about the son's mental state.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, enforcing household responsibilities is part of raising responsible adults. However, the method used here\u2014cutting off the WiFi\u2014led to a significant escalation. The son's reaction suggests that the action was a major trigger. While the parents have a right to expect contributions, the way they enforced it might be seen as overstepping, especially since the son is an adult. The immediate removal of a resource (WiFi) without a prior discussion or alternative plan could have been counterproductive.\n\nAdditionally, the parent's response to the son's aggression (telling him he can't eat their food) might not be an effective disciplinary measure. It could be seen as cutting off access to basic necessities, which might be excessive. The son's subsequent actions (damaging the door) are clearly wrong, but the parent's initial action may have contributed to the escalation.\n\nHowever, the parents are in a tough spot. The son is not contributing to the household, and the parents are dealing with their own emotional distress from the mosque shootings. The parent's motivation might be to enforce responsibility, but the method might not have been the best approach. The son's addiction to gaming complicates things, as it's a known issue that affects his behavior.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents have the right to set household rules, but the way they enforced them might have been too harsh without considering the son's age and the potential consequences. The son's reaction was inappropriate, but the parents' actions could have been handled more thoughtfully to avoid such a confrontation. The fact that the son later washed the car and left might indicate that the conflict was resolved, but the parents are still worried about his well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent's actions could be seen as a justified attempt to enforce responsibilities, but the method might have been too abrupt. However, the son's subsequent aggressive behavior is clearly his fault. The parents are not necessarily in the wrong, but their approach could have been improved. The answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they were trying to enforce household rules, even if the method led to conflict. However, others might argue that cutting off WiFi in this scenario was an overreaction, making the parent at least partially at fault.\n"
