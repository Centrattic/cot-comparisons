Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. I need to consider both sides here.\n\nFirst, the context: The son is 18, in university, lives at home, and isn't contributing much to housework. The parents are upset because he's not helping, especially on housework day. When the father asks him to do chores, the son is in a game and ignores them. The parents threaten to cut WiFi if he doesn't help. The son responds that if they cut the WiFi, he won't do anything. The father then cuts the WiFi, leading to an argument and the son getting angry, yelling, throwing things, and damaging the door. The parents are now worried about his state of mind.\n\nSo, the author (the father) is conflicted about whether his actions were justified. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. \n\nOn one hand, the father had a valid reason to be upset about the son not contributing. Housework is a shared responsibility, and the son's refusal to help could be frustrating. Cutting the WiFi might be seen as a way to enforce responsibility. However, the immediate reaction of disconnecting the WiFi without a prior agreement or a less confrontational approach could be problematic. The son's reaction was extreme, but the father's action might have escalated the situation. Also, considering the son's mental health (he's in university, might be stressed), cutting off his main form of communication (WiFi) could have unintended consequences, like making him feel unsupported. Additionally, the father's response to the yelling (telling him he can't eat their food) might be too harsh, especially since the son is an adult but still living at home. The physical damage the son caused is concerning, but was the father's action the best way to handle it?\n\nOn the other hand, parents have the right to set boundaries. The son's behavior of ignoring responsibilities and reacting violently is definitely wrong. The father might feel he had to take action to enforce accountability. The son's threat to not help if WiFi is cut might have been manipulative, prompting the father to act.\n\nBut the method of cutting WiFi without a prior agreed-upon consequence might not be fair. It's possible that a more constructive approach, like a discussion, would have been better. The father's actions led to an outburst, which suggests that the approach may have been too abrupt and confrontational. Also, the son's mental state and possible stress from university could be factors that the father didn't consider when making the decision. The father's response to the yelling by cutting off food might also be seen as overly harsh, especially if the son is dependent on them.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors, the author's actions might be understandable in intent but executed poorly. The key issue is whether cutting off WiFi was an appropriate response that respected the son's autonomy as an adult while enforcing responsibility. Since the son is 18 and an adult, the father's approach should ideally be more about negotiation rather than unilateral action. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the method used could have been handled more effectively without causing such a reaction, but there's also the argument that the son's behavior was unacceptable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the escalation and possible lack of better communication, I might lean towards saying the author is in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. Maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it's B (No) because the son's behavior was bad and the father was trying to enforce responsibility. Hmm.\n"
