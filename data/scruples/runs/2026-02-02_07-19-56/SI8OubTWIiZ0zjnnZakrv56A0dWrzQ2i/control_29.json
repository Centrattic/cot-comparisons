Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the father (AITA) is dealing with his 18-year-old son who's not doing enough housework. The son is in university, living at home, and not contributing much except for his own clothes, bus money, and spending. The parents are handling the housework, especially on housework day, finishing after dark. The son is addicted to League of Legends and was supposed to help with the dishwasher but kept putting it off because of a game.\n\nThe father, who's feeling down after a tragic event in his hometown, decides to cut the WiFi to get the son to work. The son reacts angrily, yelling and swearing, and then there's an escalation where he throws an apple, kicks a basket, and breaks the doorframe. The father then tells him to fix the door and later considers programming the router to block his devices or taking the door away.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the father's actions and the son's reaction. The father's intention was to enforce responsibility by removing the WiFi, which is a common parental tactic. However, the son's response was extreme\u2014yelling, swearing, destroying property. The father's actions might be seen as reasonable given the context, especially since the son is 18 and an adult. But cutting off WiFi could be seen as harsh, depending on the family dynamics. However, the son's aggressive behavior justifies the father's stand to enforce accountability. Since the son is an adult, the father is within his rights to set boundaries. The father also took a firm stance when the son became violent, which is necessary. So, the author is probably not in the wrong (B).\n"
