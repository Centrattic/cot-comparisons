Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent (M49) who disconnected their son's internet because the son wasn't doing his chores, leading to a conflict. The son ended up yelling, destroying property, and then leaving. The parent now is considering further actions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The parent has a right to expect their adult son to contribute to household chores, especially since he's living at home without paying rent. However, the method of cutting off the internet might have been harsh. The son is 18, an adult, so the parent's control over his environment is a point to consider. The son's reaction was aggressive and inappropriate, which is concerning. The parent's actions were to enforce responsibility, but the escalation led to property damage and emotional distress for the family, including the daughter with OCD and Aspergers. \n\nThe parent might have overreacted by disconnecting the WiFi without a discussion, leading to a confrontation. However, the son's behavior was unacceptable, and the parent was trying to set boundaries. The parent is also dealing with emotional trauma from the Christchurch attacks, which might have affected their judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is an adult, so the parent should respect his autonomy to some extent. Cutting off internet access could be seen as controlling behavior. However, considering the son's addiction to gaming and lack of responsibility, the parent's actions might be a form of tough love. The key factors are: was the parent's action proportionate? Did they have the right to cut the internet? The son's reaction was extreme, but the parent's initial action might have been a trigger. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intention was to enforce responsibility, but the method could have been handled differently. However, the son's behavior was clearly in the wrong. The parent might not be in the wrong entirely, but there's room to question the approach. The answer could lean towards the parent not being in the wrong because they were trying to address their son's lack of responsibility, but the method could have been more constructive. Alternatively, the parent might be in the wrong for not considering alternative solutions before cutting the internet. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's actions led to a negative outcome, but the son's behavior was also problematic. The parent's decision to disconnect the WiFi was a response to the son's refusal to help. However, the parent's subsequent actions (refusing food) might be seen as excessive. Given the son's adult status, the parent should balance authority with respect for his autonomy. The answer might be that the parent is not in the wrong (B) because they were trying to enforce responsibility, but the situation is complex.\n"
