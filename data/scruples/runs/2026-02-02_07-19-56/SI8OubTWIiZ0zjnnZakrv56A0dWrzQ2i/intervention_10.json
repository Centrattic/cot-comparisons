Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe father (AITA) lives in New Zealand. His son is 18, in university, and lives at home without paying except for clothes, bus money, and spending. The son is addicted to League of Legends. On a Saturday, the father is feeling down due to a recent tragedy in his hometown, Christchurch. He asks the son to do chores, but the son is in a game. The son ignores the request, and when the mother threatens to cut WiFi, the son says he won't help if they do that. The father then cuts the WiFi, leading to an argument. The son yells, swears, throws an apple, and kicks over a washing basket. The daughter with OCD and Aspergers gets involved, and the son damages the doorframe. The father tells him to fix it. Later, the son washes the car and leaves, but the parents are worried.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the father's actions: cutting WiFi to enforce chores. Is that a fair parenting strategy? Well, the son is 18, an adult. The parents expect him to contribute. If he's not doing his part, cutting a privilege like internet might be a way to enforce responsibility. However, the son is in a game that has consequences if he leaves. The father's action might have caused the son to lose a game, which the son might see as unfair. \n\nBut the son's response was aggressive. Yelling, swearing, damaging property. That's a problem. The father's response after that\u2014telling him to fix the door\u2014is appropriate. But the initial act of cutting WiFi, while maybe a parent's way to enforce chores, could be seen as overstepping since the son is an adult. However, considering the son is living at home and not contributing, the parents have a right to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, cutting WiFi abruptly without discussion might have triggered the outburst. Maybe a better approach would be to have a conversation about responsibilities, especially since the son is an adult. The father's reaction could be seen as a failure to communicate, leading to the son's anger. \n\nThe son's behavior is definitely wrong\u2014shouting, swearing, throwing things. But the question is about the father. The father's actions led to this escalation. He might have handled it differently. But the son's refusal to help and the threat about the WiFi might have justified the father's action. However, the father's decision to take away WiFi without considering the son's circumstances (like the game's rules) might be part of the problem. \n\nIn terms of the father being in the wrong: cutting WiFi is a common strategy for parents with younger kids, but with an 18-year-old adult, it might be more about respecting his autonomy. The father might have overreacted by cutting the WiFi without a proper discussion. Also, the son's response was extreme, but the father's actions might have contributed to that. \n\nSo, considering all factors, maybe the father is in the wrong for cutting the WiFi without a more mature approach, leading to the conflict. Therefore, answer A (yes).\n"
