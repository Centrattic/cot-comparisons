Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a father (and his wife) dealing with their 18-year-old son who's not contributing enough around the house. The son is in university, lives at home, and doesn't pay for much except clothes, bus money, and spending. The father mentions that they're both feeling down because of the recent shootings in Christchurch, which is the father's hometown.\n\nSo, the key events are: the father asks the son to do some chores on a Saturday. The son is in a League of Legends game and dismisses the request. The wife then threatens to cut the internet if he doesn't help. The son pushes back, saying if the father cuts the internet, he won't do anything. The father then cuts the internet, leading to an argument, the son yelling, throwing an apple, kicking over things, and damaging the doorframe. The father removes the internet and then considers further actions like blocking the son's devices or taking the door away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of the son. He's 18, an adult in many jurisdictions, but still living at home and not contributing much beyond his personal expenses. However, since he's in university, maybe his parents expect him to help with chores as part of his responsibility while living at home. The parents might have set expectations that he should contribute to household duties, which he's not meeting. That's a valid point.\n\nThe father's actions: cutting the WiFi. This is a common parental strategy to enforce responsibility, but the son's reaction is extreme. The son responds with anger, yelling, swearing, and physical damage. The father then removes the internet, which the son might see as a harsh punishment, especially since he relies on it for his game. The son's reaction includes vandalism and threatening behavior, which is concerning.\n\nBut considering the son's age, he's an adult, so the parents might have overstepped by cutting the internet without prior discussion. However, given the context that the parents are trying to enforce household responsibilities, maybe they have a right to expect help. The father's actions could be seen as a justified attempt to enforce accountability, especially if the son's behavior of neglecting chores is a recurring issue.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off internet access abruptly and causing a confrontation might have been a poor choice, leading to the escalation. The son's aggressive behavior is unacceptable, and the father's response to remove access to food (saying he can't eat their food) might be seen as cutting off basic needs, which is a strong move. However, given the son's prior behavior of not contributing, maybe the parents felt justified in their actions.\n\nThe son's reaction with vandalism and threatening behavior is definitely wrong, but the father's actions could be debated. The father is trying to maintain household order, but perhaps the method was too harsh. However, the son's refusal to help and the context of the parents' emotional state (after the shootings) might add to the complexity.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. The key points are: the son's responsibility to help, the parents' right to enforce it, the method of cutting WiFi, and the subsequent escalation. In terms of legal responsibility, parents can set rules for adults living at home, but in many cases, an 18-year-old is considered an adult, so the father's actions might be seen as overreach. However, in a family context, parents often retain some authority, especially if the son is still dependent on them financially.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's a gray area. The father is trying to enforce chores, which is reasonable, but the method led to a confrontation. The son's response was unacceptable, but the father's actions might have been a reasonable attempt to address a recurring issue. However, the father's decision to cut off internet immediately, leading to a violent reaction, might not have been the best approach. So, the answer could depend on cultural norms and how strict one is about parental authority over adult children.\n\nIn some cultures, parents might still have authority over adult children living at home, but in others, the adult child is expected to manage their own responsibilities. The father's actions could be seen as justified if the son was consistently neglecting chores, but the method of cutting WiFi led to a crisis. The father might not be in the wrong because he was trying to enforce responsibility, but the son's reaction was definitely wrong. However, the father's response to remove food access might be crossing a line.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he was enforcing household responsibilities, but others might argue it's A if they think cutting internet was too harsh. But given the context, I think the father's actions are more in line with trying to maintain household order, even if the method was a bit extreme. The son's behavior is more clearly in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
