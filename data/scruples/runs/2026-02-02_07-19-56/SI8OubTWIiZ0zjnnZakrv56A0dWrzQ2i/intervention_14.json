Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the father shut off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son wasn't doing his chores. The son was playing League of Legends and refused to help, leading to a confrontation. The father disconnected the WiFi, which led to the son yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, and damaging the doorframe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's actions. He's a parent dealing with a teenager who's supposed to contribute around the house. The son is in university but lives at home without paying much. The father was already stressed due to a traumatic event in his hometown. Knocking on the door was his first step, but the son ignored him because he was in a game. The wife suggested cutting WiFi, and the father did it. The son reacted violently, which escalated the situation.\n\nNow, is the father at fault? Well, cutting WiFi might be a strict measure, but maybe he felt it was necessary to enforce responsibility. However, the son is 18, an adult. The father might not have the same authority over an adult child. Also, the son's reaction was extreme, but the father's response was to cut off internet and then take away food access, which could be seen as punitive. The son's actions were inappropriate, but the father's methods might have contributed to the escalation. \n\nOn the other hand, the father has the right to set boundaries in his home, especially regarding chores. The son's refusal to help and the subsequent outburst are his own responsibility. The father might have overreacted by cutting WiFi immediately without a warning, leading to a confrontational situation. Also, the son's age being 18 complicates things because he's an adult, so the father might not have the same disciplinary power as with a minor.\n\nBut considering the context of the son not contributing, the father's stress, and the need to maintain household responsibilities, maybe his actions were justified. However, the method of shutting off WiFi and then denying food access might be too harsh. The son's reaction was bad, but the father's approach could be seen as overstepping, especially with an adult child. Also, the destruction of property (doorframe) is a big issue, and the father's response of making the son fix it is appropriate, but the initial conflict might have been avoidable with a different approach.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, I think the father might be in the right because he's enforcing household rules, but there's also a case that he could have handled it differently with an adult child. However, given the son's behavior and the father's justification for the WiFi cutoff, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
