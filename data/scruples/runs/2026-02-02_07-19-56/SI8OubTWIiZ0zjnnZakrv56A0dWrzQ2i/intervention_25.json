Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's living at home, not contributing enough to housework, and being addicted to League of Legends. The father is feeling down due to a traumatic event in his hometown and is trying to motivate the son to help out.\n\nFirst, the father went to the router and disconnected the WiFi because the son wasn't doing his chores. The son reacted angrily, swore, and even damaged the doorframe. The father then told him he can't eat their food unless he buys his own. The son got more upset, threw an apple, and kicked over a basket. The daughter with Aspergers was upset by the shouting, and the son ended up staying at a friend's place, possibly drinking.\n\nNow, considering the father's actions: cutting off WiFi is a common parenting strategy to encourage responsibility. However, the son is 18 and an adult. The father's methods led to a violent reaction. The key points here are the son's age and the escalation of conflict. The father's motivation was to enforce household responsibilities, but the approach might have been too harsh, especially given the son's vulnerability (university student, living at home, potential mental health issues). The son's anger and subsequent destructive behavior suggest that the WiFi cutoff triggered a strong negative reaction. The father's response to cut off food access adds another layer of punishment, which might be excessive. The daughter's well-being was also affected, which is a significant concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is dealing with his own trauma from the mosque shootings, which could affect his judgment. The son's behavior in not doing chores and the father's attempts to make him responsible are on the father's side. However, using food as leverage and removing WiFi without a clear, calm discussion might have been too abrupt. The son's reaction indicates that the approach backfired, leading to more conflict.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The father's intention to enforce responsibility is understandable, but the method and the subsequent punishments (especially withholding food and damaging property) might be where he went wrong. The son's actions were clearly inappropriate, but the father's response may have contributed to the escalation. The fact that the son is an adult adds complexity; treating him like a child with strict punishments might not be the best approach. However, since he's still living at home and not paying for his stay, the parents have some authority. Still, the father's methods could be seen as overstepping, leading to the conflict. So, the father might share some responsibility here.\n"
