Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the father (M49) shut off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son wasn't doing his chores. The son was playing League of Legends and was in the middle of a game. The father disconnected the router, leading to a big argument where the son yelled, swore, threw things, and damaged the doorframe. Now the dad is considering whether to block the son's devices or remove the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's actions. He asked the son to do chores, which is reasonable, especially since the son is living at home but only paying for clothes, bus, and spending. The father was feeling down due to a traumatic event in his hometown, which might have affected his mood. He tried to get the son to help but when the son didn't, he cut the WiFi. That seems like a strict measure, but maybe he felt it was necessary to enforce responsibility.\n\nBut then the son reacted aggressively, which is a problem. The father's response was to take away the WiFi, which led to the son's outburst. However, the son's behavior (yelling, swearing, throwing objects) is definitely inappropriate and could be seen as disrespectful and even abusive, especially towards the daughter with OCD and Aspergers. The father's actions might have escalated the situation, but the son's reaction might have been the bigger issue here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. On one hand, cutting off WiFi can be a form of punishment, but since the son is an adult, maybe the father overstepped. However, the son is still living at home and hasn't contributed financially except for a few expenses. The father might feel it's his responsibility to set boundaries. But the method of using WiFi as a lever might be a bit harsh, and the resulting confrontation led to a dangerous situation with the son's outburst.\n\nBut the son's actions are also extreme. The father had the right to enforce chores, but perhaps the way he did it (shutting off WiFi immediately) might not be the best approach. However, considering the son's addiction to gaming and not contributing, the father's frustration is understandable. The real issue might be the communication breakdown. The father could have set clear expectations and consequences beforehand, but he didn't. Cutting the WiFi in the moment might have been impulsive, leading to the conflict.\n\nIn terms of the son's response, the aggression and property damage are inexcusable. The father's decision to make him fix the door is reasonable, as is his wife's worry. The father might have overreacted in the heat of the moment, but the son's subsequent behavior is a bigger problem. However, the father's actions could be seen as contributing to the conflict, so maybe he shares some responsibility. But considering the son's age and the fact that he's living at home without contributing, the father's actions might be justified as a last resort. However, using WiFi as a punishment could be seen as targeting the son's personal device, which might not be appropriate for an adult child.\n\nSo, the answer might be a bit of both, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the father's action led to the son's outburst, maybe he is partially at fault. However, the son's behavior was the main problem. The father's actions might be within his parental authority, even though they contributed to the escalation. But in some perspectives, using WiFi as a punishment is a bit extreme. The answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because he used a drastic measure that led to a harmful confrontation, or B (not in the wrong) because he was trying to enforce responsibility. Given the son's subsequent actions, maybe the father isn't entirely at fault. But the initial action of cutting the WiFi without prior discussion might have been too hasty. I'm leaning towards A, but I'm not sure.\n"
