Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent (the author) who shut off the Wi-Fi because their 18-year-old son wasn't doing his housework. The son is in his second year of university and lives at home but only pays for clothes, bus money, and spending. The parents are upset that he's not contributing enough, especially on housework day. The son was playing League of Legends, which he can't quit without penalties. The parent cut the Wi-Fi, leading to an argument and then some destructive behavior from the son, including throwing an apple, kicking a basket, and damaging the door frame.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 18, an adult, but still living at home. The parents might expect him to contribute to household chores. The son's addiction to gaming is an issue here. However, cutting off Wi-Fi as a form of punishment could be seen as harsh, especially since the son's ability to do his university work might depend on internet access. Also, the son's reaction was extreme, but the parent's action directly led to that. \n\nThe parent mentioned they were feeling down due to a recent tragedy in their hometown. That might have affected their motivation and patience. But even so, physically disconnecting the router without a warning might have been abrupt. The son's response\u2014shouting, swearing, and damaging property\u2014is clearly wrong, but the parent's initial action might have escalated the situation. \n\nThe parent then took further steps by refusing the son food, which is another point. Telling an adult child they can't eat your food if they yell is a bit extreme and could be seen as cutting off support, leading to more conflict. The son's actions (throwing things, damaging the door) are unacceptably violent, but the parent's response might have contributed to that by using a heavy-handed approach.\n\nThe parent is now considering more drastic measures, like blocking the son's devices from the router or removing the bedroom door. However, the son is an adult, so the parent needs to balance discipline with respect for his autonomy. The parent's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially since the son is an adult. The key issue here is whether the parent's methods of enforcing responsibility were appropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents have a right to expect their son to contribute to the household. The son's refusal to do so and the subsequent behavior are problematic. But the method of cutting off Wi-Fi without giving him a chance to finish his game (which he can't quit without penalties) might have been unfair. It's possible the parent could have handled it differently, like setting a time limit or using a more structured approach.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. They have a right to enforce household rules, but their method might have been too harsh. However, the son's behavior was definitely inappropriate. The parent's actions might be justified in trying to get their son to contribute, but the way they went about it could have been better. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on the appropriateness of their actions versus the son's. Given that the parent took a direct and forceful approach leading to a conflict, there's a case to be made that they are somewhat at fault. However, the son's response is also clearly wrong. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the parent. I think the parent's initial action (cutting off Wi-Fi) is a form of punishment that can be seen as valid, but the way they did it (without considering the son's game) and the subsequent denial of food might be excessive. However, the son's violent reaction is on him. The parent's actions might not be entirely wrong, but there's room for criticism in how they handled it. However, given the son's behavior after, maybe the parent is not in the wrong. It's a tough call. I'm leaning towards the parent not being in the wrong because they had a valid reason to enforce chores, but their approach could have been better. But since the question is a yes or no, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nGiven that the parent's main issue was enforcing responsibilities and the son's reaction was extreme, maybe the parent isn't in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
