Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves a father (49) who turned off the internet for his 18-year-old son after the son was being uncooperative with housework and was playing a game. The son then reacted angrily, yelling, throwing things, and damaging the doorframe. The father also restricted his son's access to food after the yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 18, a university student living at home, not paying for much except clothes and bus money. The parents feel he's not contributing enough to housework. The father had asked him to help, which the son initially dismissed. The parents used the threat of cutting WiFi as a tactic to get him to help. When the father actually did it, the son reacted violently. The father also took away food access after the yelling.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the father is in the wrong. On one hand, the son was being disrespectful and not contributing, which the parents were trying to address. Shutting off WiFi is a common parenting strategy, but the son's reaction was extreme. However, the father escalated the situation by removing food access, which could be seen as punitive and possibly harmful. Also, the son is an adult now, and controlling his access to food might be overstepping. The father's actions led to the son's anger and subsequent damage, but the son's behavior was inappropriate.\n\nThe key points: the father used a harsh measure (cutting WiFi) which the son found unacceptable, leading to a conflict. The father's response to the yelling by cutting off food might be seen as excessive, especially since the son is an adult. The son's actions (yelling, damaging property) are definitely wrong, but the father's methods might have contributed to the escalation.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, while the father had legitimate concerns about his son's contributions and behavior, the way he handled it could be problematic. Using food as a weapon is a serious measure and might not be appropriate, regardless of the son's actions. Also, the son's age as an adult suggests that the parents should consider his autonomy more. The father's actions might be seen as overreacting, especially leading to the son leaving the house and the parents being worried about his well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the father might be partially in the wrong for escalating the situation with the food restriction, even though the son's behavior was unacceptable. The answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the use of food as punishment and not considering his son's autonomy as an adult. However, the son's actions were clearly wrong too. But the question is about the father's accountability. The decisive factors are the food access and the conflict escalation. So the answer is A.\n"
