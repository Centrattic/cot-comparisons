Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a father (AITA) who shut off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son wasn't doing housework. The son is in university, lives at home, and plays a lot of League of Legends. The father was already upset about the recent mosque shootings in his hometown.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The parents have a system where the kids are supposed to do housework, especially on housework day. The son was supposed to do his tasks but was in a game. The parents gave him an ultimatum: do the work or lose WiFi. The father cut the WiFi, leading to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, threw things, and damaged the door. The father took away the WiFi and later threatened to remove the door if it wasn't fixed. The son then went to a friend's and didn't respond to messages, making the parents worried.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. Let's consider the parents' perspective. They set expectations for household responsibilities. The son, despite being an adult, isn't contributing, which is causing stress. The father's actions\u2014cutting WiFi\u2014are a form of punishment to enforce accountability. However, the son's reaction was aggressive and destructive, which is concerning. The parents are trying to manage both housework and their son's behavior.\n\nFrom the son's side, he's 18, at university, and maybe relying on his parents for support. He's in a game, which he can't leave without penalties. The ultimatum from his mom might have felt unfair, leading to his anger. His actions were extreme, but maybe he felt cornered.\n\nLegally, the son is an adult, so parents' control over his environment might be limited. However, since he's living at home, the parents might still set rules. The father's response\u2014cutting WiFi\u2014could be seen as a legitimate consequence. However, taking away the door or not allowing access to food might be harsh, especially if the son is an adult. The father's decision to remove the WiFi is a common punishment, but the escalation to cutting off food access and removing the door could be overstepping, given the son's age.\n\nThe father's emotional state due to the recent shootings adds context. He was already stressed, which might have influenced his actions. However, that doesn't excuse harsh measures without considering the son's maturity.\n\nIn terms of parenting, there's a line between holding a young adult accountable and being overly controlling. The son's destructive behavior indicates a problem, but the father's response might have contributed by not considering alternative solutions. Maybe a discussion rather than immediate punishment could have been more effective. However, the father did try to communicate, and the son refused to comply.\n\nThe key points are: the son wasn't following household rules, the father enforced consequences, the son reacted violently, and the father is now considering further punishments. The father's actions might be seen as necessary for enforcing responsibility, but the son's age and the severity of the response (like removing WiFi and food) could be seen as excessive. The parents might need to balance accountability with the son's autonomy as an adult.\n\nGiven that the father acted within the context of household rules and the son's refusal to comply, the father isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's a possibility that the escalation could have been handled differently. But based on the information, the father's actions were a response to the son's inaction and disrespect. So the answer might be B (Not the author's fault) because the father was trying to enforce rules, even if the son overreacted.\n"
