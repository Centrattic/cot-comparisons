Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to unpack this situation. The user is asking if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The scenario involves an 18-year-old son who's living at home, not contributing much to housework, especially on housework day. He's also addicted to League of Legends. The parents are upset because he's not helping, and the father (the author) decided to cut the WiFi as a consequence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of an 18-year-old. Since he's an adult now, maybe he's expected to contribute more. But he's still in university and not paying for much except his own expenses. The parents might feel he's not pulling his weight. The father's motivation is understandable\u2014trying to get the son to help out with chores. However, the method he used was to shut off the WiFi, which led to a confrontation where the son got angry, swore, and caused damage.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was the father's action justified? The son was in a game and couldn't leave without penalties, which he mentioned. The father didn't give a heads-up, just cut the WiFi. The son's reaction was aggressive, but does that make the father wrong? Or was the father's action a reasonable parenting tactic, even if it escalated things?\n\nI should think about typical parenting advice. Cutting off internet access is a common consequence for not following through on responsibilities. However, the way it was done\u2014without warning\u2014might have triggered a strong reaction. Also, the son's mental state is a factor. He's an adult, but still living at home. The father's actions might be seen as overstepping if the son is now an adult, but the father is trying to enforce responsibility.\n\nThe aftermath: the son caused damage, swore, and the daughter was affected. The father's response was to remove access to food, which is a bit extreme. But considering the son's behavior, maybe it's a consequence for his actions. However, removing access to food might not be the best approach. Also, the father is worried about the son's well-being now.\n\nIs the father in the wrong? It's a tough call. He wanted to enforce chores, which is reasonable. But the immediate cutoff of WiFi without prior discussion might have been too abrupt. Also, removing food access is harsh. The son's reaction was extreme, but the father's escalation might have contributed to that. The father could have handled it differently, maybe by setting clearer expectations or having a discussion before cutting off the WiFi. So, maybe the father isn't entirely wrong, but his approach had flaws.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is an adult and should take responsibility for his actions. The father's actions could be seen as necessary to set boundaries. However, the physical damage and the son's emotional response might indicate that the approach was too confrontational. The father might have intended to teach a lesson, but the method caused harm. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms and parenting styles. In some contexts, cutting off internet as a consequence is acceptable. However, the immediate and forceful action without prior communication could be seen as overstepping. The father's subsequent actions (removing food access) might also be problematic. So, considering all that, the author might be partially at fault for not handling it more calmly and with better communication. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) but I'm a bit conflicted because the intention was to enforce responsibility. Alternatively, B (Not in the wrong) if seen as a parent acting to teach accountability. Hmm.\n"
