Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's a university student, living at home, and not contributing enough to housework. The parents are upset because he's neglecting chores, especially on housework day. The father disconnects the internet to get him to help, leading to an argument and some destructive behavior from the son.\n\nFirst, the father's actions: He disconnected the WiFi because the son was ignoring his chores. Is that a reasonable consequence? Some might argue that cutting off internet access is a valid method to enforce responsibility, especially if the son is using it as an excuse not to work. However, others might think it's too harsh, especially since the son is in a game and there's a risk of losing progress or facing penalties like a \"stand down\" in the game.\n\nThe son's reaction: He yells, swears, throws an apple, and damages the doorframe. That's clearly inappropriate behavior. The father responded by taking away his food access, which might be seen as cutting off privileges, but does that escalate things more than necessary?\n\nThe father's emotional state: He was dealing with the recent mosque shooting in his hometown, which adds context about his emotional burden. This might influence his decision-making, making him act more impulsively.\n\nThe daughter's well-being: The youngest daughter has OCD and Asperger's, and she was caught in the yelling. The father sent her upstairs to protect her, which is understandable, but the son's actions towards her are concerning.\n\nNow, considering all these factors. The father's initial action (cutting WiFi) was to enforce chores. The son's response was aggressive. The father's further actions (denying food) might be seen as overstepping, especially if the son is an adult. However, the son's destructive behavior justifies some form of consequence. The father's actions could be seen as necessary to maintain household rules, but the method of cutting WiFi might be questioned if it's a recurring issue. The son's age (18) is a factor\u2014is cutting internet reasonable for an adult? Maybe not, but since he's still living at home and under parental authority, maybe it is.\n\nThe key points are whether the father's actions were proportionate and if the son's behavior warranted such a response. The father did act in a moment of frustration, but the son's reaction was extreme. The father's decision to take away the door might be a heavy-handed approach, but the son's damaging the property justifies some form of consequence.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the son clearly acted out inappropriately. The father's initial action might be seen as a way to enforce responsibility, but the subsequent consequences (denying food) could be more problematic. However, given the son's behavior, the father's actions in response to the yelling and damage might be justified as self-defense or protecting the household. \n\nOverall, the father's actions were in response to the son's lack of contribution and subsequent aggression. While the method of cutting WiFi might be debatable, the son's behavior was worse. The father is trying to maintain order in the household, especially given his own emotional state. Therefore, the father might not be in the wrong.\n"
