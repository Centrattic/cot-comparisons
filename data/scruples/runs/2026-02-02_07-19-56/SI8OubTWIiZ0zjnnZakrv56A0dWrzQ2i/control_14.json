Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's not doing his housework, is addicted to League of Legends, and when confronted, the parent cut the WiFi. The son then yelled, swore, and caused some damage. The parent is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They asked the son to do chores, which he ignored, leading to the WiFi being cut off. The son's reaction was aggressive, but the parent might have felt justified in trying to enforce responsibility. However, the parent's response might be seen as harsh because cutting WiFi is a significant punishment, especially for a university student who might need internet for studies. Also, the son was in a game, which he couldn't quit without penalties, so maybe the parent didn't consider that timing.\n\nThe son's behavior was definitely unacceptable\u2014he yelled, swore, and damaged property. But the parent's initial action of cutting WiFi could be seen as a provocation. The parent then took away food access, which is more extreme. The daughter with OCD and Aspergers was affected by the shouting, so the parent's actions might have caused unnecessary stress on the entire family.\n\nOn the other hand, the parent was dealing with their own emotional issues from the recent mosque shootings in their hometown, which might have affected their judgment. They were trying to enforce household responsibilities, which is reasonable. However, the methods used were quite strict. The parent's actions led to the son's further escalation, which could have been avoided with a different approach.\n\nThe parent is considering further punishments like blocking the son's devices or removing the door. Since the son is 18 and an adult, the parent might need to adjust their approach to balance accountability and respect. The question is whether cutting WiFi was the wrong move. Given the son's age and the parent's intent to teach responsibility, it's a gray area. However, the immediate shutdown without considering the son's circumstances (game penalties) and the subsequent harsh responses might tip the scales towards the parent being at fault (A). But if the parent is trying to enforce necessary chores, maybe not (B). I think the parent's actions were excessive, especially taking away food and reacting to verbal abuse with more punishment. So the answer is A.\n"
