Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong after shutting off the WiFi because their son wasn't helping with housework. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the son is 18, in university, living at home without paying for much except clothes, bus money, and spending. The parents are frustrated because he doesn't do enough housework, especially on housework day. The son was playing League of Legends and didn't help. The parents told him if he didn't help, they'd cut the WiFi. He refused, saying that if they did, he wouldn't do anything because he can't leave a game once it starts. The father then cuts the WiFi, leading to an argument, yelling, swearing, the son breaking a doorframe, and other disruptive behavior. The parents are worried now about his state of mind.\n\nSo the question is whether the author (the father) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The father's action was cutting the WiFi to enforce the son doing chores. The son is an adult (18), but still living at home and not contributing. The parents set a condition: if he doesn't help, no WiFi. He didn't comply, and the father followed through. However, the son's reaction was extreme: yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, kicking over a basket, breaking the doorframe. The father then told him to fix the door. The son later washed the wife's car but then went out, possibly getting drunk. The parents are worried.\n\nNow, considering if the father is in the wrong. On one hand, the son is an adult, and controlling WiFi access could be seen as overstepping, especially since he's not a minor anymore. But the parents might argue that they set household rules and the son wasn't following them. However, cutting WiFi led to a violent escalation. The father's action might have been a reasonable attempt to enforce responsibilities, but the son's reaction was disproportionate and possibly indicates deeper issues, like stress or mental health problems.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author (father) is in the wrong. The father's action was cutting the WiFi, which is a common parenting tactic for younger kids. But since the son is 18, is that appropriate? Some might say that an adult son should have more autonomy, and cutting internet access without consent could be seen as controlling. Also, the father's response after the son's outburst\u2014telling him to fix the door\u2014could be justified, but the initial action (cutting WiFi) might not be. However, the parents had already given a warning, and the son refused to comply. The father followed through on the threat, which led to the son's extreme reaction. \n\nAnother angle: the father had a valid reason (son not contributing) and felt justified. But the son's mental state and possible stress (since he's in university) might be a factor. The father didn't consider that cutting WiFi could lead to such an outburst, especially with a son who has emotional issues (the daughter has OCD and Aspergers, maybe the son does too). The father might have acted without considering the son's possible emotional response.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral responsibility, parents can set boundaries, but when the child is an adult, the line is thinner. Cutting WiFi could be seen as a reasonable consequence for not doing chores, but the father's actions led to a physical altercation in a way. However, the son's behavior was the direct cause. The father's action was a consequence, but the son's reaction was extreme. \n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, enforcing household rules is reasonable. On the other hand, cutting internet access for an adult child might be seen as overstepping, especially if it leads to conflict. However, the father had already given a warning and the son refused to comply. The father's action was a consequence for the son's non-compliance. But the son's reaction shows that he might have been under stress, and the father's action might have triggered it. \n\nIn summary, the father's action might be justified in enforcing household responsibilities, but the approach could be questioned, especially with an adult child. However, the son's extreme reaction was his own responsibility. So perhaps the father isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe there are better ways to handle it. The answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the father enforced a rule that was previously communicated, and the son's actions were the root of the problem.\n"
