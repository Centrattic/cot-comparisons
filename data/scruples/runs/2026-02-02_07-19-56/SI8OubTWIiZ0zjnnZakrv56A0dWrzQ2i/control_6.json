Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about a father (M49) who shut off the WiFi to get his 18-year-old son to help with housework. The son was in a League of Legends game and refused to help, leading to a conflict. The son then started yelling, swearing, threw an apple, and damaged a coffee table. The father told him he had to fix the doorframe. The son later went to work and planned to stay at a friend's.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of the father and the son. The father was dealing with a difficult situation, especially with the recent events in Christchurch affecting his mood. He asked his son to do chores, but the son was unresponsive. The father then took the WiFi as a consequence. \n\nBut wait, the son is 18 and in university, living at home. The father mentions he doesn't pay for anything except his clothes and bus money. The son's addiction to gaming might be a problem, but the father's approach was to cut off the WiFi, leading to the son's outburst. The father's response to the yelling was to remove the WiFi again, and later took away food and required the son to fix the door. \n\nNow, considering if the father is in the wrong. The initial action of turning off the WiFi could be seen as a parent trying to enforce responsibility, but since the son is 18, some might argue he should be held to adult standards. However, the father's actions after the son's outburst\u2014like removing the WiFi again and cutting off food access\u2014might be harsh. Also, the son's behavior (yelling, swearing, damaging property) is clearly problematic, but the father's response in the heat of the moment could be seen as overstepping, especially if the son is an adult. \n\nBut the father's intent was to get the son to help around the house. The son was given a warning before the WiFi was cut. The father might be doing what he thinks is necessary to enforce accountability. However, taking away the family's WiFi for an adult child's actions could be seen as punitive and possibly unfair, especially if the son is still dependent. Also, the father's decision to make the son fix the doorframe is reasonable, but the other actions like cutting off food and router might be too much. \n\nSo, the question is whether the father overreacted. The son's behavior was aggressive, but the father's response might be considered necessary in some contexts. However, given that the son is an adult, even if living at home, the father's actions could be seen as controlling. But the son also damaged property and was disrespectful, so the father might feel justified in imposing consequences. \n\nI think the key here is that the father tried to enforce household responsibilities and used WiFi as a consequence. The son violated the house rules, leading to the father's decision. However, the father's subsequent actions (removing WiFi again, making the son buy his own food) might be too harsh for an adult. The initial act of turning off the WiFi might be NTA, but the escalation could make the father HTA. But the original question is about whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for shutting off the WiFi. The initial act was to get the son to do chores, which could be seen as a parent's duty. However, the son's reaction was extreme, but perhaps the father's approach was too confrontational. \n\nIn some cultures, parents may still control the home environment, but in others, 18 is considered an adult. The son's addiction to gaming is an issue, but the father's method of cutting off WiFi might be a reasonable step to encourage responsibility. However, the father's actions after the son's outburst (like removing the WiFi again and cutting off food) are more punitive. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the initial WiFi shutdown was wrong. If the son is not contributing and the father tried a warning first, maybe it's not wrong. But the son being an adult could argue for more autonomy. However, the son's disrespectful and destructive behavior might justify the father's actions. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he was trying to enforce household responsibilities and had been warned. The son's aggression is his own issue, and the father had the right to remove the WiFi if it's part of the house rules. The subsequent actions (like removing the router) might be part of enforcing consequences. The father's intent was to get the son to help, which is a parent's right. The son's reaction is more to blame here. So the author is NTA.\n"
