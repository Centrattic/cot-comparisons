Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent disconnecting the WiFi because their adult son isn't doing his chores. The son was in the middle of a game, which he can't leave without consequences. The parent then cuts the internet, leading to a confrontation where the son yells, throws things, and causes damage.\n\nFirst, the son is 18, an adult, and living at home but not paying for much beyond clothes and bus fare. The parent is trying to enforce responsibility by cutting off the WiFi, which is a common method some parents use to get kids to do chores. But the son is in a game, and the parent doesn't consider that he might be in a commitment situation. However, the parent's motivation is also emotional, given the recent tragedy in their hometown. That might add some stress and affect their judgment.\n\nWhen the son yells and acts out, the parent's response of cutting off food seems harsh. Telling the son he can't eat their food and has to buy his own is a significant escalation. Also, the son's behavior, like throwing an apple and kicking over a basket, is problematic. The parent then tells him to fix the broken doorframe, which is fair, but the overall situation is escalating quickly.\n\nThe parent's actions might be seen as justified if they're trying to enforce household rules. However, the method of cutting WiFi without prior discussion or compromise could be a point of contention. The son being in a game adds a layer where the parent might have overreacted if they didn't consider the consequences of cutting internet during a game. Also, the parent's response to the son's outburst by cutting food is more extreme and might be seen as punitive beyond what's necessary.\n\nAdditionally, the son's reaction is clearly inappropriate, involving yelling, swearing, and damaging property. The parent did try to address the initial issue (chores) and then the behavior, but the escalation could have been handled differently. The parent might not be in the wrong for addressing the chores, but the way they escalated the situation (especially the food part) could be problematic. The son, however, is clearly at fault for his outburst and actions.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent might not be entirely wrong in trying to enforce chores, but the handling of the situation could have been more measured. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes) because of the extreme reactions like cutting off food and the physical damage caused. But some might argue the parent isn't wrong for setting boundaries. The key is whether the parent's actions were proportionate. The initial WiFi cut is a common tactic, but the food part escalates it. The answer is a bit nuanced but leaning towards A.\n"
