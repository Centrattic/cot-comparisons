Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent dealing with their 18-year-old son who's not helping with housework and is addicted to gaming. The parent disconnected the WiFi after the son refused to help and got angry, leading to a confrontation where the son broke the doorframe. The parent is now considering further actions like blocking the router for the son's devices or removing the door.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the parent's actions. The parent approached the son to help with chores, and the son was in a game. The parent shut off the WiFi, which is a common parenting strategy some use to encourage responsibility. However, the son reacted violently, yelling, swearing, and damaging property. The parent then took some disciplinary actions, like denying food and making the son fix the door. \n\nNow, considering the parent's perspective: they were dealing with a grown son who's not contributing and is living at home without paying. The parent's actions were a response to the son's refusal and subsequent aggression. The parent did try to reason calmly but faced escalation. The parent's decisions to cut WiFi and deny food could be seen as attempts to enforce responsibility, but denying food might be too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is an adult, so the parent's control over his internet and food might be problematic. The parent might be overstepping by not respecting the son's independence. However, since the son lives at home and the parent is the homeowner, there's a gray area. The key issue is whether the parent's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The son's aggression and the parent's response need to be weighed. The parent didn't use physical violence but did escalate by cutting off WiFi and food. The damage caused by the son is significant. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parent's initial action (cutting WiFi) is a common tactic, but the denial of food might be crossing a line. However, the son's behavior was extreme. The parent is also dealing with emotional stress from the Christchurch incident, which might have influenced their response. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The son's actions were clearly wrong, but the parent's response might be seen as justified in enforcing household rules. However, the parent should consider the adult nature of the son and perhaps more communication or boundaries. Since the parent's actions were in response to the son's refusal and aggression, and the parent is the one providing the home, the answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong (B). But there's a consideration that using food as a weapon is inappropriate. However, given the context, the parent's actions were a reaction to the son's misconduct. So, final answer B.\n"
