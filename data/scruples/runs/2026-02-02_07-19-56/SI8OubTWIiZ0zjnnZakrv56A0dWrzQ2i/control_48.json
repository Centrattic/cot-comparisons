Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent (the author) cutting off WiFi because their 18-year-old son wasn't doing his chores. The son was playing League of Legends and refused to help. The author turned off the WiFi, leading to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, and caused damage. The author then threatened the son's access to food and property.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' expectations. They mentioned the kids aren't doing enough housework, especially on housework day. The son is in university and lives at home without paying for much. The parents had asked him to do chores, but he was in a game. The author's action of cutting WiFi seems like a disciplinary measure. However, the son's reaction was aggressive, leading to damage and emotional distress for the family, including a younger sister with Aspergers.\n\nNow, the key points here. The parents wanted their son to contribute. The son, being 18, is an adult. The author's response was to cut WiFi, which is a common tactic for some parents to enforce responsibility. But the son's reaction escalated, which the parents might not have anticipated. The parents then took further steps, like forbidding food and making him fix the door.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the parents had a reason to be upset about their son not helping, especially after the traumatic events in their hometown. Cutting WiFi is a form of punishment, which is a parenting style. However, the son is an adult, so the parents' authority might be questioned. But since he's still living at home and not paying rent, the parents might feel they have a right to set rules. \n\nBut the aggressive reaction from the son was extreme. The parents' response to his behavior (taking away food, making him fix the door) might be seen as overstepping if the son is an adult. However, the parents did de-escalate the situation with the wife helping later. \n\nOn the other hand, the son's actions (yelling, swearing, damaging property) are problematic. The parents' initial action (cutting WiFi) is a common parenting tool, but the aftermath shows that the son's behavior is concerning. The parents might have been within their rights to enforce consequences, especially if the son was neglecting responsibilities. However, the method of cutting WiFi might be seen as controlling, but since he's an adult, there's a line about how much control parents have. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce household responsibilities. Their actions were a response to their son's refusal to help and subsequent aggression. The son's behavior was inappropriate, and the parents took steps to address it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
