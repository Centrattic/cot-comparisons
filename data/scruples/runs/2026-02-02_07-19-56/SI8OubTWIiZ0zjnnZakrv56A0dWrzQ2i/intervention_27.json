Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's living at home, not contributing to housework, and being addicted to gaming. The parents are struggling with their own feelings after a traumatic event in their hometown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They've asked the son to help with chores, but he's ignoring them because he's in a game. The parents threaten to cut the WiFi if he doesn't comply. The son then reacts aggressively, leading the father to disconnect the WiFi. The son yells, throws things, and breaks a doorframe. The father's response includes removing WiFi and restricting food access. The son later fixes the car but leaves for a friend's place.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents had a valid concern about household responsibilities. The son is an adult but still living at home without contributing much. The father's actions were a direct response to the son's refusal to help and subsequent aggressive behavior. However, cutting off the WiFi entirely, especially in a university student's case, can be seen as a harsh measure. Also, restricting access to food after a confrontation might escalate the situation. The son's mental health and the daughter's sensitivity to conflict add complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, the father was dealing with his own trauma from the mosque shooting, which might have affected his emotional state. The son's behavior was clearly disrespectful and destructive. The parents did try to communicate before taking action. However, the method of disconnecting WiFi without a clear plan for when to restore it could be seen as overly punitive. The father's response to the son's aggression (removing WiFi and food) might not be the most constructive approach, especially considering the son's age and responsibilities.\n\nConsidering all factors, while the father's actions were a reaction to the son's behavior, the methods used might have been too harsh. The son's age and the potential impact of losing internet on his studies and social life are important factors. The father's actions could be seen as excessive given the circumstances. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because the response was not proportionate to the issue of housework and the son's initial refusal.\n"
