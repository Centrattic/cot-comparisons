Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent cutting off their 18-year-old son's internet because he wasn't doing housework and was playing League of Legends. The son then reacted angrily, yelling, swearing, throwing things, and damaging the door. The parent took away the internet and later considered removing the door.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the parent's actions. The parent was upset because the son wasn't contributing to housework despite being an adult. The parent had asked the son multiple times, and when the son refused, the parent shut off the WiFi. This is a common method some parents use to enforce responsibilities. The parent's intention was to get the son to help out, but the son reacted violently.\n\nNow, the son's reaction seems extreme. He yelled, swore, threw food, and damaged property. This behavior indicates a lack of respect and control. The parent's decision to cut the internet was a response to the son's refusal to comply with chores. However, the parent might have considered other consequences, like taking away his phone or another privilege, but cutting off internet access is a significant action, especially for someone in university who might rely on it for studies.\n\nThe parent's argument is that the son is living at home without contributing, which is a valid concern. However, the method of cutting off internet led to an aggressive response. There's a question of whether the parent's action was justified or if it escalated the situation. The parent also took away food access later, which could be seen as an overreaction given that the son is an adult and might have the right to make his own choices, even if they're not ideal.\n\nConsidering the son's age, 18 is an adult, but he's still living at home and possibly in university. Parents might have different expectations about responsibilities. The parent's actions might be seen as within their rights as a parent trying to enforce household rules. However, the escalation of cutting off internet led to physical damage and emotional distress. The parent might have acted in a way to enforce accountability, but the son's violent response complicates things.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent might not be in the wrong for trying to enforce responsibilities, especially since the son had previously refused. However, the method of cutting off internet without considering alternatives could be a point of contention. The parent's follow-up action of denying food access might also be seen as excessive. The key here is whether the parent's actions were proportionate to the son's refusal. Since the son's response was violent, the parent's initial action might be defensible, but the situation escalated beyond their control.\n\nAnother angle is the parent's emotional state. The parent was feeling down due to a traumatic event in their hometown. This could affect their judgment, but it doesn't necessarily make their actions wrong. However, the son's mental state might also be a factor\u2014maybe he's under stress from university, which the parent didn't consider. The parent might need to address the underlying issues rather than just the immediate behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parent had valid reasons to enforce household responsibilities, the method and subsequent reactions might not be entirely justified. The parent's actions led to a violent reaction, and taking away food is a harsh measure. The answer might lean towards the parent not being in the wrong (B) because they were trying to enforce responsibilities, but there are aspects where they could have handled it differently. However, given the context, the parent's actions are more about enforcing household rules, so the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
