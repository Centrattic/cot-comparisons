Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent dealing with an 18-year-old son who's not contributing to household chores and is addicted to gaming. The parent, feeling down due to a traumatic event in their hometown, confronts the son, who is in the middle of a game. The parent cuts the WiFi, leading to an argument and the son's outburst, including damage to the house and yelling at family members.\n\nFirst, the son is 18 and living at home without paying for much except personal expenses. The parents expect him to do chores. The son was in a game, which the parent asked him to stop for a bit. The parent's action of cutting WiFi was a response to the son's refusal. However, the son's reaction escalated into shouting, swearing, throwing things, and damaging property. The parent then told him he can't eat their food and that he needs to fix the door he damaged.\n\nThe key points here are: the parent's motivation (trying to get chores done, dealing with personal stress), the son's age and responsibility, and the resulting conflict. The parent took a firm action to enforce chores, which the son resisted. The son's response was aggressive, leading to property damage and affecting a younger sibling with anxiety.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? The parent's action was to enforce household responsibilities. However, cutting WiFi might be seen as harsh, but considering the son's refusal and the need for chores, it's a reasonable step. The son's reaction was extreme and unacceptable. The parent then set boundaries about food and fixing the door. The parent's actions were in response to the son's behavior. Since the son is 18, he's an adult, but still living at home. The parent's actions were to enforce responsibility and consequences. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
