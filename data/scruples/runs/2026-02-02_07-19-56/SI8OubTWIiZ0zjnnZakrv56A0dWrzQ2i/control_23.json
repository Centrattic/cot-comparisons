Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the father shut off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son wasn't doing his chores, especially on housework day. The son was playing League of Legends and didn't want to stop because he could get a penalty for quitting a game. The dad turned off the router, leading to a yelling match and some damage to the house.\n\nFirst, the son is 18 and living at home but isn't paying for anything except clothes, bus money, and spending. The dad and wife are working hard on housework day, and the son isn't contributing enough. The dad was also dealing with emotional trauma from the Christchurch shootings, which is a heavy context.\n\nThe dad's actions: he shut off WiFi after being told that the son was in a game. The son then reacts by shouting, swearing, throwing things, and damaging the door. The dad's response was to cut the internet, which caused a lot of conflict. Now the wife is worried because the son stayed out late and might be drinking.\n\nIs the dad in the wrong? Well, the son is an adult, but still a teenager. Parents have a responsibility to manage their household, but they also have to consider the well-being of their children. Cutting off WiFi as a punishment might be seen as a reasonable action for a parent to enforce responsibility, but the escalation to yelling, throwing things, and damage complicates things. The dad's actions might have been a necessary firm stance to teach responsibility, but the son's reaction was extreme. However, the dad's decision to take away food access and then the door might be seen as harsh, especially since the son is an adult. There's a balance between maintaining household rules and respecting an adult child's autonomy. The dad might be justified in enforcing chores, but the method of cutting WiFi could be questioned. However, given the son's addiction to gaming and lack of contribution, the dad's actions could be seen as a way to enforce accountability. On the other hand, the son's reaction is concerning, and the dad's response of removing the door might be too extreme. The key factors are the son's age, his responsibility in the household, and the dad's emotional state. Considering all this, the dad's actions might be seen as a reasonable attempt to enforce household rules, so he might not be in the wrong. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given the son's behavior and the dad's intent to teach responsibility, the answer could be B (No). But I need to check if cutting WiFi is within the parents' right and if the consequences were too harsh. Since the son is still under their roof, they can manage the WiFi. So, maybe B is the correct answer.\n"
