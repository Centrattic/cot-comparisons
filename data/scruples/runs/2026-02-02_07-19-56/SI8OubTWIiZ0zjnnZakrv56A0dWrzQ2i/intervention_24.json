Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who shut off the Wi-Fi is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's not contributing to housework, especially on housework day. The parents are dealing with a stressful time, especially since there was a tragic event in their hometown. The dad decides to cut the Wi-Fi when the son doesn't help, leading to a conflict where the son yells, throws things, and damages the door. Now the parents are worried about him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of the author. He disconnected the Wi-Fi to enforce responsibility. The son was in a game and refused to help, leading to the dad's action. But the son's reaction was aggressive, which escalated the situation. The dad's intention was to make the son contribute, but the method might be harsh. However, the son is 18 and living at home without paying much. The parents might be trying to teach responsibility.\n\nBut then, the son's response\u2014shouting, swearing, throwing an apple, kicking things\u2014seems excessive. The dad's response to cut Wi-Fi might be seen as a necessary action given the circumstances. However, the aftermath, like taking away the door, could be too severe if the son is an adult. The dad also withheld food, which might be crossing a line. The son's mental state is a concern, especially with his daughter's Asperger's and OCD, so the environment's stress could be contributing.\n\nOn one hand, the dad acted out of frustration and to enforce responsibility. On the other, his actions led to a conflict that could have been handled more carefully. The son's behavior is clearly problematic, but the dad's method might not be the best approach. However, given the context of the son not contributing and the dad's stress from recent events, maybe the dad isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe the dad should have communicated better first, given the son's addiction to gaming and possible stress from university. Cutting Wi-Fi abruptly without a prior discussion might have been a mistake. The dad's intention was good, but the method and consequences might be too harsh. The son's reaction is bad, but the dad's actions could have been more measured. So, considering all factors, the dad might be in the right to enforce responsibility, but perhaps the way he did it was flawed. However, since the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the dad's actions were to enforce responsibility, the answer might be B (No). But some might argue the dad went too far. Hmm.\n"
