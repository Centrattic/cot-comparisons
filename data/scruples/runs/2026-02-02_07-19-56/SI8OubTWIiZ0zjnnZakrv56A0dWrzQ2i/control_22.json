Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. So, the situation is about an 18-year-old son who's living at home, not doing enough housework, and being addicted to League of Legends. The parents are dealing with a lot of stress after a traumatic event in their hometown. The father, who's feeling down, decides to cut the WiFi because the son isn't helping out on his housework day. The son reacts angrily, yells, throws an apple, and breaks the doorframe. Now the parents are worried about his state of mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're asking the son to contribute, which is reasonable, especially since he's living at home. The son is in university but doesn't pay for much except his own stuff. The parents set a boundary by cutting the WiFi when he refuses. But maybe the way they did it was too harsh, especially given the son's reaction. The son's behavior seems extreme\u2014shouting, throwing things, breaking the door. But he's 18, an adult, and maybe the parents didn't handle it the best way.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's addiction to gaming could be a problem. He might not be responsible, and the parents are trying to enforce some responsibility. But cutting off the WiFi without a conversation or giving him a chance to finish his game might have triggered the outburst. The son's response was aggressive, but maybe he's under stress too, especially since he's away at university and might be dealing with his own issues. The fact that he later washed the car and went to work suggests he might have regretted his actions, but the parents are still worried.\n\nThe parents are also dealing with their own trauma from the mosque shooting, which might have made them more sensitive to the situation. The father might have reacted impulsively, which led to the son's anger. The question is whether the father's action was justified. Cutting off the WiFi could be seen as a necessary measure, but the way it was done, without a discussion, might have escalated the situation. Also, taking away the door as a punishment could be too harsh, especially for an adult son.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the parents had a legitimate concern about the son not contributing. However, their method of addressing it might have been too abrupt, leading to a conflict. The son's behavior was definitely unacceptable, but the parents might have overreacted in the way they handled it. The key point is whether the parents acted in a reasonable and proportionate way. Since they didn't give the son a chance to finish his game or communicate effectively, maybe they were in the wrong. But on the flip side, expecting the son to help out is fair. It's a bit of a gray area, but the immediate action without prior discussion might be the issue here. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because the father didn't give the son a fair chance, leading to the conflict. However, others might argue that the parents are within their rights to enforce rules in their home. But given the son's reaction and the parents' emotional state, it's a tough call. I think the answer leans towards A because the method was too abrupt, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the parents are trying to teach responsibility, maybe B. Hmm.\n"
