Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's not contributing to housework and is addicted to gaming. The parents are trying to motivate him, but he's resistant. The father, dealing with emotional trauma from a recent event in his hometown, takes drastic action by cutting the WiFi. The son reacts angrily, leading to a confrontation and some property damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're trying to get their son to take responsibility for housework. He's 18, living at home, and not paying for much except his own expenses. The father is struggling with his own emotions and has a valid reason to be stressed. Removing WiFi could be seen as a way to enforce responsibility, but it's a harsh measure. However, the son's argument that he can't quit a game mid-match is understandable, but that doesn't excuse his lack of help around the house.\n\nThen there's the son's reaction. He yells, swears, throws food, and damages property. That's clearly unacceptable behavior. The parents' response\u2014cutting WiFi and then removing his access to food\u2014might be seen as escalating the situation, but it's in response to the son's actions. The father's actions were a reaction to the son's refusal to help and subsequent outburst. The son's actions led to the consequences.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the parents have the right to enforce rules in their home, especially when their child is not living up to his responsibilities. The father's decision to cut WiFi is a form of punishment, but the son's aggressive response was not justified. The parents are also dealing with a teenager with Asperger's and OCD, which might make the situation more complex. However, the son's behavior was still inappropriate regardless of his age or the circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. The son's initial refusal to help and the subsequent outburst are significant factors. The father's actions, while strict, were in response to the son's behavior. The parents are trying to teach responsibility, and the son's reaction was excessive. Therefore, the father isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
