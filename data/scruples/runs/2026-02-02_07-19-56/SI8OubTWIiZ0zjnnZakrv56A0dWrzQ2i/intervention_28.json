Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent cutting off their 18-year-old son's WiFi because he wasn't doing his chores. The son was in the middle of an online game, and there's some conflict that escalated into yelling, throwing things, and damaging a door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent did disconnect the WiFi, which the son was using for gaming. The son is 18, so he's an adult, but still living at home. The parent's intention was to get the son to do his chores. Is cutting off WiFi a reasonable method here? On one hand, it's a way to enforce responsibility. On the other hand, it's a harsh measure that led to a confrontation.\n\nThe son's reaction was aggressive, which is problematic. He yelled, swore, threw an apple, and damaged property. The parent also took away his access to food initially, which might be crossing a line. But the parent did later allow him to eat after the son calmed down. However, the damage to the door is significant. The parent made the son fix it, which is fair.\n\nNow, considering the parent's mental state. The parent is dealing with the trauma of the Christchurch shootings, which is a heavy context. They might be more sensitive and less patient. The son's addiction to the game and lack of contribution to chores adds to the stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The parent's actions were a direct response to the son's inaction. The son's reaction was extreme, but the parent's method of cutting off WiFi might have been the trigger. The parent has a right to set household rules, but the way they enforced it led to a conflict. However, the son's behavior was unacceptably aggressive. \n\nThe parent also mentioned considering further actions like blocking devices or taking the door away. However, the son is an adult, so the parent's authority is a bit of a gray area. The parent is allowing the son to live there without paying rent, so maybe they have a right to set rules. But the approach taken could be seen as harsh, especially given the son's age and the resulting damage.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions were reasonable. The parent's initial action (cutting WiFi) is a common method to enforce chores, but the son's response was extreme. The parent's follow-up (withholding food) might be too much. However, the parent did step back later. The damage caused by the son is significant, but the parent's actions led to that. So, the parent's actions might be seen as contributing to the problem. \n\nI think the parent is partly at fault for using a harsh method that led to the confrontation. The son is also at fault for his aggressive behavior. But the question is about the parent being in the wrong. The parent's actions could be seen as reasonable in trying to enforce chores, but the way it was handled (cutting WiFi, then food) might be too severe. The parent might be in the right (NTA) because they were trying to set boundaries, but their method could be questioned. However, given the son's response, the parent might be HTA (Here There Aren't) or NTA. But the user thinks the parent is in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might be A (Yes, the parent is in the wrong) because disconnecting WiFi and then food could be too harsh, leading to the son's outburst. Alternatively, B (No) because the parent was enforcing rules. But considering the son's reaction, maybe the parent's actions were a catalyst. The parent might be HTA (Half the Bag), but the options here are A or B. The user says they think the parent is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The parent's actions were a direct cause, but the son's response was extreme. The parent might be NTA because the son is responsible for his own behavior. However, the parent could have handled it differently. \n\nGiven the options, the answer is B (No, the parent is not in the wrong) because they were trying to enforce household responsibilities, even if the method led to conflict. The son's actions were his own choice, so the parent isn't in the wrong. The parent's actions were a reasonable attempt to get the son to do his chores, even if it escalated. Therefore, the parent is NTA.\n"
