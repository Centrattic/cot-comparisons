Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The father (and his wife) are upset because their son, who's 18 and in university, isn't contributing enough to housework. On housework day, the son was supposed to help but was playing League of Legends instead. The parents had previously given him chances, but when the mother threatened to cut the WiFi if he didn't help, the son said he wouldn't help if they did that. The father then disconnected the router, leading to a confrontation. The son reacted with yelling, swearing, threw an apple, kicked a basket, damaged the door, and is now staying at a friend's. The parents are worried.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nSo, factors to consider: the son's age (18, adult), his responsibility (living at home but not paying for much), the parents' approach to enforcing responsibility through WiFi cutoff, the son's reaction, and the resulting damage.\n\nOn one hand, the parents wanted to enforce responsibility. The son was neglecting his chores, and cutting off WiFi could be seen as a consequence. But is it appropriate for a parent to do that to an adult child? The son is an adult, so maybe the parents are overstepping by controlling his access to WiFi. Also, the son's reaction was extreme, but the father's action might have triggered it. The father's response to the yelling and apple-throwing by cutting off food access and threatening to take the door away might be seen as harsh.\n\nCultural norms might matter here. In some places, parents might still have authority over adult children, especially if they're living at home and not financially independent. However, others might view this as undermining the adult son's autonomy.\n\nThe parents might have had better options, like setting different consequences or communicating more clearly. The father acting impulsively by cutting WiFi without discussing it might be problematic. Also, the son's mental state and possible stress (being in university, gaming addiction) could play a role. But the son's behavior was definitely disrespectful and damaging.\n\nThe key points: Is cutting off WiFi a reasonable consequence? Is the father's reaction appropriate for an adult child? Are there other factors like the son's addiction or mental health that should be considered?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's intent was to enforce responsibility, but his methods led to a violent reaction. Maybe there's a balance between accountability and respect for the son's autonomy. The father might be in the wrong because he didn't consider alternative methods and used a heavy-handed approach, leading to escalation. Alternatively, he's trying to teach responsibility, which is a parent's role, even for adult children.\n\nBut given that the son is 18 and an adult, the parents might not have the same authority. The father's actions could be seen as infantilizing the son. The son's reaction, while extreme, might be a result of the father's provocation. So the father might be at fault for not handling it differently and for using a method that led to conflict.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method used was too harsh, especially against an adult, leading to escalation. However, there's a nuance here because the son wasn't fulfilling his responsibilities. But the way the father handled it could be problematic.\n"
