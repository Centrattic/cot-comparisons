Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a parent (the author) cutting off their 18-year-old son's internet because he wasn't doing housework. The son was in the middle of a game of League of Legends and refused to stop to help. The parent shut off the WiFi, leading to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, threw an apple, and damaged the doorframe. Now the parent is considering whether to take further action.\n\nFirst, the son is 18 and living at home, not paying rent except for some expenses. He's in university, so maybe he's supposed to be studying, but there's no mention of academic performance here. The parents are handling the household chores, which the son isn't contributing to. The parent's motivation was to get him to help with housework, which is a reasonable expectation, especially since he's living there without paying rent. The timing is after a traumatic event in their hometown, which might have affected the parent's stress levels.\n\nThe parent shut off the WiFi as a consequence for not doing chores. The son responded aggressively, which is concerning. The parent then took away his access to food, which is a big step. The son's reaction escalated to property damage. Now the parent is questioning their actions.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, they were trying to enforce responsibility, which is normal for parenting. But the method of cutting off WiFi is a form of punishment. However, the son's reaction was extreme. The parent's actions might be seen as necessary to teach responsibility, especially since the son is an adult. However, taking away food is a more severe consequence than just removing internet access. Food is a basic need, so cutting that off could be harsh. Also, the parent might not have considered other consequences like restricting the son's internet through the router's settings instead of a complete cutoff, which caused immediate frustration.\n\nThe son's behavior (yelling, swearing, throwing things, damaging property) is definitely in the wrong, but the parent's actions in removing food might be excessive. The question is whether the parent's actions were justified. The parent's intent was to get the son to do chores, which is reasonable, but the response to the son's aggression (taking away food) might not be proportionate. Also, the son is an adult, so the parent's authority might be less applicable. However, he's still living under their roof, so they might feel they have some responsibility to set boundaries.\n\nIn terms of the parent's actions, cutting off WiFi is a common tactic for parents with younger kids, but with an adult, it's a different dynamic. The parent might be overstepping by using food as a punishment. The son's destructive behavior is a separate issue, but the parent's handling of the situation could have contributed to the escalation. Maybe the parent should have addressed the son's behavior after the fact, like fixing the door, but taking away food might be crossing a line. So, the parent might be in the wrong for the food part, but not the initial WiFi cutoff. The answer depends on whether the food punishment is seen as too harsh. Overall, the parent's actions were in response to the son's refusal to help, but the food aspect is problematic.\n"
