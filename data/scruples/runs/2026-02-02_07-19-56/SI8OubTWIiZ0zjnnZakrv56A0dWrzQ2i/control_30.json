Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the parents have an 18-year-old son who's in university but lives at home without contributing much except for small expenses. The kids aren't doing enough housework, especially on housework day. The parents are dealing with the aftermath, finishing up after dark. The son is addicted to gaming, specifically League of Legends. \n\nOn Saturday morning, the author (father) is feeling down because of the recent mosque shootings in Christchurch. He's not very motivated. He asks the son to do some chores, like emptying the dishwasher. The son is in a game and says okay, but doesn't do it. An hour later, the wife checks and the son says if they cut the WiFi, he won't do anything. The father then disconnects the WiFi. The son yells, swears, throws an apple, kicks a basket, and damages the doorframe. The daughter, who has OCD and Aspergers, gets upset. The son later fixes the wife's car but stays at a friend's, and the parents are worried.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the points. The son is 18, an adult, but still lives at home. Parents have a right to set boundaries, especially regarding responsibilities. However, the son's response was aggressive and harmful, which is concerning. The parents had asked him to help, and he didn't comply. So the father's action of cutting WiFi could be seen as a reasonable measure to enforce responsibility. But the son's reaction escalated into violence (damaging property, yelling, swearing), which is not acceptable. However, the father's initial action might have been a bit abrupt, but given the context\u2014son not helping, parents overwhelmed, and the son's addiction\u2014it's a way to enforce accountability. The parents also took further actions, like making the son fix the door. The son's behavior is problematic, but the parents are trying to maintain household order. The father's action might be justified as a parent trying to get his adult son to contribute. However, the method of disconnecting WiFi without giving another option could be seen as harsh, especially if the son was in a game. But considering the son's prior behavior and the parents' need for help, it's a measure to enforce responsibility. The son's response was extreme, but the father's action might not be entirely wrong. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
