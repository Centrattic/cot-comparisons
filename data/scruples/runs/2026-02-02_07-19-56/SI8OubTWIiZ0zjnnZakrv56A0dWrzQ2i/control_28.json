Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong after cutting off the WiFi because his son wasn't doing his chores. The son is 18, in university, and living at home without contributing much except for his clothes and spending money. The son is also addicted to League of Legends.\n\nFirst, the father's motivation. He's feeling down because of the recent mosque shootings in his hometown. He's trying to get the household chores done but the son isn't helping. The son was in a game and promised to start, but didn't. The wife threatened to cut WiFi if he didn't help, and the son threatened not to do anything if the WiFi was cut. The father then disconnects the router, leading to the son's outburst. The son yells, throws an apple, kicks a basket, and damages the door. The father tells him to fix the door and the son later washes the car but plans to stay out.\n\nNow, is the father in the wrong? Well, the son is an adult. The father has a right to set boundaries, especially regarding household responsibilities. However, cutting off WiFi abruptly might be a harsh method, especially without prior discussion or setting clear expectations. The son's reaction was extreme, but the father's actions might have escalated the situation. The father also took away food access, which is a bit severe. However, considering the son's behavior and the father's emotional state due to the recent tragedy, the father's actions could be seen as a last resort.\n\nBut the key points: the son is an adult, and the father has the right to enforce rules in his home. However, the method of cutting WiFi without communication might not be the best approach. The father's response to the son's outburst by removing food access is questionable. But overall, the father was trying to enforce chores and deal with a difficult situation. The son's actions were definitely inappropriate. The father might be in the right for trying to enforce responsibilities, but his methods could be debated. However, in terms of legal and parental rights, the father is in a position to set these boundaries. So the answer is B (No).\n"
