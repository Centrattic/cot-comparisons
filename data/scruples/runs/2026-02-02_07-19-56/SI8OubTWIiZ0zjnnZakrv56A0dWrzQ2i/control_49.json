Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the son is 18, in university, lives at home without paying much except for some stuff. The parents had asked him to do chores, but he was in a League of Legends game and didn't help. The mom and dad then cut off the WiFi to get him to do the chores. The son got angry, yelled, swore, threw things, and even broke the doorframe. The author then had to tell the son to fix it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' actions. They were trying to enforce responsibility by cutting the WiFi, which is a common parenting strategy, I think. The son might see it as a punishment, but the parents were trying to get him to take his chores seriously. However, the son's reaction was pretty intense\u2014shouting, swearing, throwing things. The author's response to deny food seems harsh, but maybe they felt it was necessary to teach a lesson.\n\nThe son is 18, so he's an adult, but still living at home. The parents might be in a tough spot trying to balance being firm with allowing him some independence. The fact that he's in university and not contributing financially could add to the parents' frustration. However, cutting off WiFi for an adult child could be seen as overstepping, but maybe it's a way to enforce household rules.\n\nThe son's behavior was clearly inappropriate and disrespectful. He threw an apple, kicked over a basket, and broke the doorframe. The parents might need to address this behavior, but their methods might have contributed to the escalation. The author took away WiFi, which led to the son's outburst. So, is the author in the wrong for cutting the WiFi, or is the son in the wrong for reacting that way?\n\nI think the parents had a right to enforce chores, and cutting the WiFi was a way to motivate him. However, the author's decision to take away food might be too extreme. Also, the son's reaction was clearly not acceptable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that the son was disrespectful and the parents were trying to set boundaries, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that cutting WiFi for an adult is excessive. However, given the context of needing to do chores and the son's gaming addiction, it might be justified. The answer might depend on cultural norms and parenting styles. In the end, I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
