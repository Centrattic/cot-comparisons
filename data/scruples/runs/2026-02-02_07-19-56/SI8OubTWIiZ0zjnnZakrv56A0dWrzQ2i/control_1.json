Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who cut off the WiFi is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the father (M49) is dealing with his 18-year-old son who's living at home, not contributing much to housework, and is addicted to League of Legends. On a Saturday morning, the dad asks the son to do some chores, but the son is in a game and says he'll do it later. Then the wife threatens to cut the WiFi if he doesn't help, and the son responds that if they do that, he won't do anything. The dad then disconnects the router, leading to the son yelling and swearing, throwing an apple, kicking over a basket, and damaging the doorframe. The dad then makes the son fix the door and later has to deal with the aftermath.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the dad's actions were justified. The son is an adult, but still living at home and not contributing financially except for some basics. The dad is dealing with emotional stress from a recent tragedy in his hometown, which might be affecting his patience. The son's behavior seems to be a pattern of not doing his share, and the dad is trying to enforce responsibility.\n\nThe dad's decision to cut the WiFi was in response to the son's non-compliance. Is that a reasonable action? Maybe. But the son's reaction was extreme\u2014shouting, swearing, destroying property. The dad then took away his food access as a consequence, which escalated things further. The son's actions, like damaging the doorframe, are clearly wrong.\n\nNow, considering the son's age (18), he's an adult, so the dad's approach might need to be different from when the child was younger. However, the son is still living at home and the parents might be in a position to enforce rules. The key question is whether cutting the WiFi was an appropriate response to the son's refusal to do chores, given the prior threats from the son.\n\nThe son's threat was that if the WiFi is cut off, he won't do anything. The dad cutting it off could be seen as following through on the wife's threat, but it led to a violent reaction. The dad's actions might be justified as a way to enforce responsibility, but the consequences (son's outburst) were severe. However, the son's response was clearly unacceptable, and the dad's subsequent actions (taking away food access, making him fix the damage) are also part of the equation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The dad was trying to enforce accountability, but the method might have been too harsh given the son's age and the resulting escalation. The son's behavior was definitely wrong, but the dad's initial action might have been a reasonable attempt to enforce household rules. However, the way the conflict escalated suggests that maybe there was a better approach. So, is the dad in the wrong? It's possible that he wasn't, but there's room for argument either way. The key is that the son's actions were worse, but the dad's methods might have contributed to the conflict.\n"
