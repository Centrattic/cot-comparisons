Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi.\n\nSo, the situation is about an 18-year-old son who's not doing his housework. The parents are upset because he's living at home without paying much except for clothes and bus money. The son is playing League of Legends, and when the dad shuts off the WiFi, the son reacts angrily, yelling, swearing, breaking things, and causing damage. The dad also takes away his food but later sends him money to buy his own. The son ends up breaking the doorframe and needs to fix it. The parents are worried about him now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if cutting off WiFi was justified. Parents often set boundaries for chores, even for adult children living at home. The son isn't contributing and has a gaming addiction. The dad's motivation is about responsibility. However, the method might be harsh, leading to a violent reaction. Did the dad overstep? Maybe. But the son's behavior was also extreme.\n\nThe dad's actions led to a confrontation where the son became aggressive, which is concerning. The dad tried to enforce a rule, but the son's response was out of control. The dad then removed food access, which might be seen as punitive. However, the son damaged property and was disrespectful towards his sister, so the dad's response could be seen as a form of discipline.\n\nBut the dad's approach might be too extreme. Cutting off WiFi is a significant action, and taking away food access is problematic, even if it's symbolic. The son's mental health might be an issue here, as he's in university and stressed. The dad's actions might have pushed him into a worse state.\n\nAlso, the dad's emotional state is mentioned\u2014he's dealing with trauma from the mosque shootings in his hometown. That could affect his judgment. However, he still needs to consider his son's reaction and mental state.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The dad was trying to enforce responsibility, but the method led to a harmful situation. The son's actions were definitely wrong, but the dad's approach might have contributed to the escalation. So, maybe the dad is partially at fault for using a harsh method without considering the son's possible reaction. However, the son's behavior was inexcusable. The answer depends on cultural norms and parenting styles, but generally, cutting off WiFi is a parenting technique some might use. However, taking away food is more questionable. So, the dad might be in the wrong for that part, but not entirely. But according to the options, it's either A (yes) or B (no). The consensus here might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he was trying to enforce chores and boundaries, even if the methods were harsh. Alternatively, A if the methods were too extreme. I'm a bit torn, but since the user wants a clear answer, I think B might be more likely here because the core issue is about responsibility, and the dad's actions, though harsh, stem from that. But the food part is tricky. Maybe the answer is A because cutting off food is not appropriate. Hmm. Let me check again. The dad said if the son was going to yell, he can't eat his food. That's a punishment, but taking away food isn't good. Also, the dad's actions caused the son to act out more. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm not 100% sure. Another angle: the son was an adult, so the dad shouldn't control his food. So taking away food was wrong. Therefore, the dad is in the wrong (A). But maybe the initial WiFi cutoff is okay. Hmm. The question is about the author being in the wrong. The answer is A if the actions were unreasonable. Given that the son is an adult, the dad's response might be overstepping, especially with food. So I think A is the answer. But I'm a bit confused. Let me go with A.\n"
