Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent disconnecting their adult son's WiFi because he wasn't doing his housework and was in a game. The son then reacted angrily, yelling, swearing, and causing damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 18, a university student living at home, and not contributing much beyond his chores. The parents are upset with his lack of help. The father cuts the WiFi because the son was prioritizing gaming over chores. The son's reaction was aggressive and destructive. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent's action was to shut off the WiFi as a consequence for not doing chores. But the son is an adult. Even though he's living at home, some might argue that controlling his internet access is an overreach because he's an adult and should be responsible for his own actions. However, the parents are also his legal guardians until he moves out, so they might see managing household responsibilities as part of their role.\n\nThe son's response was clearly inappropriate\u2014yelling, swearing, throwing things. But the parent's initial action might have provoked that. The parent also took away food access, which is another point of contention. Is it fair to use food as a punishment? That could be seen as harsh.\n\nHowever, the son was given a chance to comply with his chores, and when he didn't, the parent acted. The parent's intention was to enforce responsibility. The son's reaction was extreme, but maybe the parent's method was too harsh, especially considering the son's age as an adult. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect\u2014the father was dealing with personal trauma from events in his hometown. That might have influenced his actions, making him more irritable. The parent might have felt justified in enforcing chores, but cutting off WiFi entirely could be seen as an authoritarian move that didn't address the underlying issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parent tried to enforce household responsibilities, which is reasonable. But the method of cutting off internet access for an adult could be seen as overstepping. The son's behavior was definitely wrong, but the parent's actions might have escalated the situation. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the parent's actions were a reasonable way to enforce chores, then maybe not. But if it's considered an unreasonable use of control over an adult, then yes. Since the son is an adult, expecting him to manage his own time and responsibilities might require different approaches, not just cutting off his internet. The parent's method might have been too harsh, leading to the son's extreme reaction. \n\nTherefore, the parent is somewhat in the wrong for using such a drastic measure, which led to conflict. But the son is also in the wrong for his aggressive response. However, the question is specifically about the parent. Considering that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the method of cutting off WiFi for an adult might be seen as an overreaction and contributing to the escalation.\n"
