Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the father) is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's in university, living at home without paying much, and not doing his housework. The dad was feeling down after a traumatic event in his hometown and decided to cut the WiFi to get the son to help. The son reacted angrily, shouted, threw things, and damaged the doorframe. Now the dad is considering further actions like blocking the router for his devices or removing the door.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether cutting the WiFi is a reasonable action. The father's intention was to motivate the son to do his chores. However, the son was in the middle of a game, which he can't leave without consequences. The dad's action led to a confrontation where the son yelled and acted out. The father also took away the WiFi, which is a significant control measure. \n\nConsidering that the son is 18 and an adult, even though he's living at home, the father's authority might be more about parental responsibility but also the son's independence. Cutting off WiFi could be seen as a harsh measure, especially if it's the only internet access and the son relies on it for communication or studies. However, the son's refusal to help with chores and the subsequent aggression might justify the father's frustration.\n\nThe father's actions led to immediate conflict. Using force to remove the WiFi might be seen as overstepping, especially if the son has a right to internet access. But on the other hand, the father is trying to enforce responsibility. The son's reaction was extreme, which complicates things. The father's decision to take away the WiFi was preemptive, but the son's response was violent, which the father might not have foreseen.\n\nThere's also the emotional state of the father, dealing with trauma from the mosque shootings. His motivation might be influenced by stress and a need to maintain household order. However, using drastic measures without communication could contribute to the conflict. The father might have considered other methods first, like a calm discussion or setting clear expectations.\n\nThe son's behavior was clearly unacceptable\u2014he yelled, swore, threw things, and damaged property. The father's response to the damage (making him fix it) seems reasonable. But the initial WiFi cutoff might have been the trigger. The father might not be in the wrong if he's trying to enforce household responsibilities, but the method could be questioned. The son's age and autonomy play a role here. At 18, the son should have some independence, and the father's actions might infringe on that unless there's a mutual agreement on household rules.\n\nIn summary, while the father's intention was to enforce responsibility, the method of cutting off WiFi without prior discussion and the resulting conflict might put him in a wrong position. However, the son's subsequent aggressive behavior also complicates the matter. The father's actions were a response to the son's inaction and disrespect, but the approach could be seen as heavy-handed.\n"
