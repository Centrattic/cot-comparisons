Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who shut off the WiFi) is in the wrong. The situation involves their 18-year-old son who's not contributing enough to housework and is addicted to gaming. The author turned off the WiFi to get him to help, which led to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, and damaged property.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the son's age. At 18, he's legally an adult, but he's still living at home and attending university. The parents mention he's not paying for much beyond his personal expenses. So, there's a mix of adult responsibilities and ongoing support here.\n\nThe parents wanted him to do chores, which is reasonable, especially if they've set expectations. When he didn't comply, the mother threatened to cut the WiFi. The father then did it. The son reacted angrily, escalating the situation. The son's reaction included yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, kicking over a basket, and damaging the door. That's a lot of aggressive behavior.\n\nNow, the author's actions: cutting the WiFi to enforce chores. Is that a reasonable consequence? It depends on the context. In some cases, parents might use loss of privileges as a consequence for not completing responsibilities. However, with an 18-year-old, it's a bit tricky. He's an adult, so maybe the parents should approach him more as an adult, perhaps with more discussion rather than abrupt actions that lead to conflict.\n\nThe son's reaction was extreme. He was in the middle of a game, which he can't quit without penalties, so the timing was bad. But that doesn't excuse him not doing his chores. The parents have the right to expect help, but maybe they could have handled it differently to avoid such an outburst.\n\nThe author's response to the son's anger\u2014cutting off internet and then threatening to remove his food\u2014might be seen as harsh. Especially since the son is still living under their roof, they have some responsibility to provide a stable environment. Disabling internet access can be a form of punishment, but when it leads to a violent reaction from the son, it's a sign that the method might not be effective or appropriate.\n\nAlso, the son's mental state is a factor. The parents mention he's not in a good state of mind and stayed out late. His behavior (shouting, swearing, damaging property) could indicate stress or other issues. The author's actions might have contributed to that escalation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's decision to cut the WiFi led to a significant conflict. While the intent was to enforce responsibility, the method might have been inappropriate given the son's age and the resulting reaction. The parents could have tried another approach, like discussing expectations or setting up a schedule, rather than abruptly cutting off internet. So, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation differently, leading to a worse outcome. But then again, they were trying to enforce household rules. It's a tough call. However, given the son's age and the excessive reaction, the author's actions contributed to the problem. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
