Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parent (M49) lives in New Zealand and is dealing with their son, who's 18 and in university. The son isn't contributing enough to household chores, especially on housework day. The parents often finish work late, and the son is addicted to League of Legends. The key incident is when the son was in a game, the parents told him they'd cut the WiFi if he didn't help. The son threatened not to help if they did. The father then cut the WiFi, leading to an argument and some destruction by the son, including yelling, throwing an apple, kicking things, and damaging the door. The son later helped by washing the car but then went out and the parents are worried he's stressed.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. Let's consider different angles. On one hand, the father tried to enforce responsibility by disconnecting WiFi, a common method for some parents. However, the son was in a game and might have been risking penalties (stand down days). The father's action led to a confrontation where the son lashed out. But the son is 18 and an adult, so maybe the parents have the right to set boundaries. The son's reaction was extreme\u2014yelling, throwing things, damaging property. The father's response was to cut off WiFi and then took away food access temporarily, which some might see as harsh but others as a consequence for behavior.\n\nHowever, the son's mental state is a factor. He's in university, living at home, and maybe stressed. The father's actions might have escalated the situation. The son's anger led to damage, which the father now wants to address by removing the door. But the son is an adult, so the parents might be overstepping by controlling his environment so strictly. Yet, they are his legal guardians until he's emancipated, depending on local laws.\n\nThe initial act of cutting WiFi is a tool to enforce chores. The son's reaction is problematic. The father's response to the yelling and apple-throwing by cutting off food might be crossing a line, as food is essential. However, the son was abusive towards his sister with OCD, which the father tried to stop by sending her upstairs. The father's actions could be seen as protecting the family, but the method of cutting WiFi and then food might be too harsh.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the father's intent was to encourage responsibility. The son's behavior was unacceptable. The father's actions led to a breakdown in communication. The question is whether cutting WiFi was a justified consequence. Some might argue yes, to teach accountability. Others might say that the son is an adult and the parents should not be controlling his environment so much, leading to the conflict. The father's follow-up actions (taking away food) could be seen as punitive beyond what's necessary.\n\nConsidering all this, the father's initial action might not be in the wrong, but the subsequent steps (cutting off food) and the overall escalation might be problematic. However, the son's behavior was also clearly wrong. The parents are trying to manage their household, and the son isn't contributing. The answer depends on societal norms and whether the father crossed a line. But since the son is 18, some might argue that the parents don't have the right to control his internet and food as they did. However, in many cultures, parents support adult children financially and may set household rules. So the father's actions could be seen as not in the wrong (B), but there's nuance here. The key factors are the son's age, the parents' role, and the proportionality of their response. Since the son is an adult, maybe the parents overstepped, but since they're supporting him, maybe they didn't. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the parents are trying to enforce responsibility, but the son's behavior was bad. However, some might say the father was wrong to cut off food, which is more severe. The final answer is tricky, but likely B, as the father was trying to maintain household rules, though perhaps the methods were harsh. The son's actions were worse, but the question is about the father. Given that, the answer is B.\n"
