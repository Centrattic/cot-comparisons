Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a parent whose son, who's 18 and in university, isn't doing his share of housework. The son is addicted to League of Legends. On a Saturday, the author tries to get him to help, but the son is in a game. The wife threatens to cut the WiFi if he doesn't help. The son says if they cut the WiFi, he won't do anything. The author then cuts off the WiFi, leading to an argument where the son yells, throws an apple, kicks over a basket, and breaks the doorframe. The author then tells the son to fix the door and the son eventually washes the wife's car but leaves for a friend's.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the elements.\n\nFirst, the son is an adult (18) but still living at home without paying for anything except clothes, bus money, and spending. The parents are handling the housework, which the son isn't doing his part. The son's addiction to gaming seems to be a significant factor here. The parents have tried asking him, but he's not compliant. The author's action was cutting off WiFi, which led to the son's outburst and damage to the house.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibilities, even though the son is an adult, he's still living under their roof, so they might feel responsible for his behavior. However, cutting off WiFi as a form of punishment could be seen as overstepping, especially if it led to aggressive behavior from the son. The son's reaction was extreme: yelling, throwing things, and damaging property. But the author's action was in response to the son not contributing to chores, which is a legitimate concern for parents.\n\nBut the key here is whether cutting off WiFi was an appropriate response. Some might argue that parents have the right to enforce rules in their home, especially regarding responsibilities. However, others might say that cutting off a basic necessity like internet for an adult could be disproportionate, especially if the son relies on it for university work or communication. The incident escalated quickly, leading to the son's aggressive behavior, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nAlso, the son's mental state is a factor. The author mentions he's an adult but might not be emotionally mature, and the son's reaction suggests he's not handling stress well. The parents are worried about his well-being, and the son's actions (breaking the doorframe, staying out late) add to that concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents have legitimate grievances about the son not contributing. They set a rule (housework day) and tried to enforce it. The son's refusal to help and his threat to retaliate by not doing anything if WiFi is cut off might have pushed the parents to act. However, cutting the WiFi as a form of punishment without considering alternatives (like a time-out period, setting consequences in advance) could be seen as reactive rather than proactive.\n\nThe author's actions led to immediate conflict, but the son did eventually help by washing the car, showing that maybe there's some accountability. However, the initial response of cutting WiFi caused a significant escalation. The parents might need to consider if there are better ways to handle the son's responsibilities without triggering such a reaction.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, since the son is an adult, the parents might not have the same authority as they would with a minor. The son's actions (vandalizing property, yelling, leaving without permission) are his own, but the parents' response could be seen as contributing to the situation.\n\nIn summary, while the parents have valid concerns about the son's behavior and responsibilities, cutting off WiFi as a form of punishment might have been an overreaction that led to an escalation. The parents might be in the wrong for not anticipating the son's extreme reaction and for using a method that could be considered excessive given the son's age and independence.\n"
