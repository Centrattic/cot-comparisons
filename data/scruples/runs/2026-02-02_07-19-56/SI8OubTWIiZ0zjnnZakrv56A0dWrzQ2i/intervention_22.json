Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves an adult son who's not contributing to housework, is addicted to gaming, and there's a tense situation after the parent disconnects the internet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They did disconnect the WiFi without prior discussion, which led to an argument and some destructive behavior from the son. The parent's motivation was to enforce responsibility around the house, but their method was abrupt. Shutting off internet access can be a heavy-handed approach, especially for an adult who's living at home but not contributing as expected. \n\nThe son's reaction was aggressive, which is concerning, especially since the daughter has OCD and Aspergers and was affected by the shouting. The parent did take steps to address the immediate issues, like making the son fix the door and not allowing him to use their food. However, the parent might have escalated the situation by disconnecting the WiFi immediately after the son threatened not to help if the internet was cut. \n\nThere's also the context of the parent's emotional state due to the recent tragedy in their hometown. That could have influenced their decision-making. But even so, the approach might have been too confrontational. The parent's goal was valid\u2014ensuring household responsibilities\u2014but the method could have been handled more calmly. \n\nConsidering the son is an adult, the parent might need to set boundaries in a way that respects his autonomy. Removing internet access entirely might not be the best approach. Maybe a more structured plan for chores and consequences would be better. The parent's actions led to a volatile situation, which could have been avoided with a different strategy. \n\nIn terms of legal or moral responsibility, the parent's actions, while coming from a place of trying to enforce rules, might be seen as overstepping, especially since the son is an adult. The parent's decision to cut off internet access without discussion might not be justified, given the resulting conflict. \n\nSo, weighing the motivations against the consequences, the parent's actions could be seen as the wrong approach, even if the intention was to enforce responsibility. The answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong because the method used was too harsh and led to negative outcomes.\n"
