Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe parent (M49) is from New Zealand and their town was affected by a mosque shooting, so they're already feeling down. Their 18-year-old son is in university, lives at home, and doesn't contribute much around the house, especially on housework day. The parent and spouse end up doing the chores after dark. The son is addicted to League of Legends. \n\nOn a Saturday morning, the parent starts work at 8 AM but isn't motivated because of the emotional impact of the shooting. At 9:30, they ask the son to do his chores and empty the dishwasher, but the son is in a game and says \"yeah yeah.\" An hour later, the wife checks and the son is still in a game. She threatens to cut the WiFi if he doesn't help. The son says if she does that, he won't do anything. The parent then disconnects the WiFi router, leading to the son yelling and swearing. The son throws an apple, kicks over a basket, breaks the coffee table, and smashes the doorframe. The parent tells him to fix it. The son later washes the wife's car, but the parent is now considering restricting his WiFi or taking his door down. The son might be getting drunk, and the wife is worried.\n\nSo the question is: Is the parent in the wrong? Answer A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the parent's actions. They asked the son to do chores, which is reasonable. The son didn't comply, was in a game, and refused to help when asked. The parent, feeling upset about the shooting and the son's lack of help, cut the WiFi. The son then lashed out with anger and destroyed property. \n\nThe parent's reasoning was to motivate the son to help by removing the WiFi, which the son was using for his game. However, the son was in a game and couldn't quit, so he was upset. The parent's actions led to the son's outburst. \n\nNow, is the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent is trying to enforce responsibility. The son is an adult (18) but lives at home and doesn't pay for much. The parent's motivation for cutting WiFi was to get him to do chores, which is a common parenting strategy. However, the parent's method resulted in the son's violent outburst and property damage. \n\nBut is the parent at fault for taking away WiFi as a consequence? Maybe not. Parents often use consequences for their children's actions. However, the son's reaction was extreme. The parent might have overreacted in terms of the immediate consequences, but the initial action (cutting WiFi) was in response to the son's refusal to help. The parent's emotional state (affected by a traumatic event) might have influenced their actions, but that doesn't necessarily make them wrong.\n\nHowever, the parent did escalate the situation by taking away the WiFi, which the son was relying on for his game. The son's response was aggressive and inappropriate, but the parent's decision to cut WiFi might have been a reasonable consequence. The parent then followed up with more consequences (telling him he can't eat their food) after the son insulted them. \n\nThe son's actions (yelling, swearing, throwing things, breaking the door) are clearly wrong, and the parent's response to make him fix the door is appropriate. The parent is now considering further measures like blocking WiFi or removing the door, which could be seen as harsh but are in response to the son's behavior.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? The parent's initial action of cutting WiFi was a response to the son's refusal to do chores. The son's reaction was extreme, but the parent's actions were in response to the son's inaction. The parent might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce responsibility. However, the parent's method of cutting WiFi might have been a bit heavy-handed, but given the context (son's addiction, lack of help, traumatic event), it's understandable. The parent's subsequent actions (denying food) might be seen as going too far, but the son was being disrespectful. \n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to enforce consequences. The son's behavior is unacceptable, but the parent's actions were in response. So, the answer might be B (the parent is not in the wrong). However, some might argue that cutting WiFi and then the parent's further actions (denying food) could be seen as punitive beyond the initial consequence. But in the context of the son's outburst and destruction, the parent's response is justified. The parent is trying to teach responsibility and accountability. So, the answer is B.\n"
