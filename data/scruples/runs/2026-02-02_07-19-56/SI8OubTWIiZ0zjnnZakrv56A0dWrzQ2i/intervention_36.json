Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation is a parent (the author) dealing with their 18-year-old son who's not contributing to housework and is addicted to gaming. The son was supposed to help on housework day but was in a game. The parent disconnected the WiFi, leading to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, threw an apple, and damaged the door. The parent is now considering further actions like blocking the router or removing the door.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's actions. The parent had a legitimate reason to be upset about the son not doing his chores. However, the method of cutting off WiFi without prior consequences might be seen as harsh. The son is an adult living at home, so the parent's authority is more about setting boundaries rather than strict parental control. \n\nBut the son's reaction was extreme\u2014yelling, swearing, and damaging property. The parent's response to taking away WiFi could be seen as a necessary boundary to enforce responsibility. However, the situation escalated quickly. The parent's actions might be justified as trying to maintain household order, but the son's age and the immediate cut-off of internet without discussion could be a point of contention. \n\nThe parent also took away food access, which is a more severe punishment. The son's anger leading to property damage is a problem, but the parent's reaction to that might be excessive. The parent is in a tough spot, balancing discipline with the son's autonomy as an adult. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parent's intent was to enforce responsibility, but the methods used (cutting WiFi without prior discussion, denying food, removing the door) might be too harsh. However, the son's behavior was also unacceptable. The parent's actions could be defended as necessary to set boundaries, but there might be better ways to handle it without such immediate and severe consequences. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the parent is trying to enforce household rules, but it's a close call.\n"
