Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The scenario involves an 18-year-old son who's not contributing to housework and is addicted to gaming. The father, who's dealing with emotional distress due to a recent tragedy in his hometown, decides to cut off the internet to get the son to help out. The son reacts angrily, yells, and causes damage, and there's concern about his state of mind afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's actions. He asked the son to do chores, which he ignored, and when his wife threatened to cut WiFi, the son threatened not to help if that happened. The father then disconnected the router. That seems like a reasonable attempt to enforce responsibility. However, the son's reaction was extreme\u2014shouting, swearing, throwing things, and damaging the door. The father then took actions like cutting off food access and requiring the son to fix the door. \n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and the appropriateness of the father's actions. Since the son is 18, he's an adult, but he's still living at home and not contributing much beyond his own expenses. The father might feel justified in trying to enforce responsibility. However, cutting off WiFi abruptly and then cutting off food access could be seen as harsh, but given the son's refusal to help and the threats, maybe the father felt it was necessary. \n\nThe son's behavior, however, is concerning. He escalated the situation with physical actions and verbal abuse, which is not acceptable. The father's response to make him repair the damage is reasonable. The main issue is whether the initial act of cutting WiFi was justified. Since the son had previously ignored requests and made threats, the father's action might be seen as a necessary measure to enforce accountability, especially given the son's age and the fact that he's living at home without contributing. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the father should have handled it differently, like setting up a schedule or involving the son in a discussion rather than cutting off internet access abruptly. But considering the son's behavior and the parent's emotional state due to the recent tragedy, the father's actions might be more about enforcing responsibility when other methods failed. \n\nSo, the father's actions, while tough, might be justified given the circumstances. The son's reaction is more problematic. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
