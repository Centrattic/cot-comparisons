Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about cutting off their son's WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's in university, living at home, and not contributing enough to housework. The parent decided to shut off the WiFi after the son didn't do his chores and got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. They're dealing with a teenager who isn't pulling his weight, especially on a housework day. The son is playing a game, which is important for him because he risks a penalty if he leaves. The parent felt it was necessary to take action to enforce responsibility. However, the son reacted violently, yelling, throwing things, and damaging property. The parent then had to confront the damage and worry about the son's well-being.\n\nNow, the parent's actions: cutting off the WiFi. Is that a reasonable disciplinary measure? The parent might argue that they're trying to teach responsibility and accountability. However, the son is 18, which is an adult age in many places, and some might say he should handle responsibilities independently without needing WiFi cut off. On the other hand, the parent is in a position to set boundaries since he's still under their roof.\n\nThe son's reaction is also a factor. The parent didn't anticipate such a hostile response, which included verbal abuse and property damage. The parent's response to the son's outburst\u2014denying food and requiring the door to be fixed\u2014could be seen as maintaining discipline, but it might also contribute to tension. The parent's actions could be viewed as overreacting, especially since the son is an adult and might need to learn from the consequences without such strict measures.\n\nAlso, the parent's emotional state is mentioned\u2014dealing with recent traumatic events in their hometown. That might have influenced their decision-making. However, it's important to consider whether their actions were proportionate. The son's anger led to self-isolation and possible risky behavior (like getting drunk), which the parent now worries about.\n\nIn terms of whether the parent is in the wrong (option A) or not (option B), there are valid points on both sides. The parent's intention to enforce responsibility is understandable, but the method and the subsequent consequences might have been too harsh. The son's age and the parent's authority over him as a guardian might mean that the parent isn't in the wrong. However, the approach could be questioned for being too strict, leading to negative outcomes. The parent's actions might be seen as necessary for discipline, but the son's reaction suggests that communication or alternative methods could have been better. So, considering all factors, the parent might not be in the wrong (B), but there's room for debate.\n"
