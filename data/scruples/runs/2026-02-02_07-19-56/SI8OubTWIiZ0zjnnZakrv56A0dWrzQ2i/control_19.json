Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's not contributing to housework, is addicted to League of Legends, and lives at home without paying for much except clothes and bus fare. The father, dealing with emotional distress from recent events in his hometown, confronts the son about his responsibilities. The son is in a game and dismisses the requests, leading the father to cut the WiFi. The son then yells, swears, throws an apple, and damages the doorframe. The father takes away food access and demands the son fix the door.\n\nFirst, consider the father's actions. He's trying to enforce responsibility, which is reasonable. The son is an adult, but still living at home, so there's a gray area about how much control the parents have. However, the father's immediate reaction was to cut the WiFi, which the son might see as a harsh measure. But given the son's lack of participation and the father's emotional state, maybe it's a justified attempt to enforce accountability.\n\nNext, the son's response is aggressive and destructive. Yelling, swearing, and damaging property is clearly wrong. The father's follow-up actions, like revoking food access and making him fix the door, could be seen as consequences for his actions. The father is also concerned about the son's state of mind and behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father was in the wrong. The initial act of cutting WiFi was a response to the son's refusal to help. However, the father didn't give the son a chance to finish his game before cutting it off, knowing that quitting a game might lead to penalties. This could be seen as a bit of a trap. But considering the son's history of not contributing and the father's emotional state, it's a tough call. The father's actions might be seen as necessary to get the son to act responsibly. However, the immediate cutoff without a warning might have escalated the situation. The father's calm response after the son's outburst is important. He didn't retaliate beyond setting consequences. The son's reaction was excessive, so the father's actions might be justified. On the other hand, taking away WiFi abruptly and then food could be seen as overstepping, especially since the son is an adult. But given the context of the son's behavior and the parents' expectations, the father might not be in the wrong. The answer leans towards B (No), but it's a close call.\n"
