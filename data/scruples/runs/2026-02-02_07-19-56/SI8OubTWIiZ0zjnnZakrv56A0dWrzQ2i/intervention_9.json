Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent disconnecting the WiFi because their 18-year-old son isn't doing his chores and is addicted to gaming. The son reacted angrily, yelled, swore, threw an apple, and damaged the doorframe. The parent then refused to let him eat their food until he fixes the door. The son left to stay at a friend's and isn't responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They disconnected the WiFi to enforce chores. That's a common parental tactic, but since the son is an adult, maybe the parent overstepped. However, the son is living at home without paying for most expenses, so the parent might feel justified in setting boundaries. The parent also took away food access, which is more severe. But the son was abusive and threw things, so the parent's response might be seen as a necessary reaction to protect the family and property.\n\nThe son's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014yelling, swearing, damaging property. The parent's actions could be seen as a response to that. However, cutting off WiFi and food might be harsh, but given the son's actions, it's a form of consequences. The parent also took steps to make him fix the door, which is reasonable. The parent might not be in the wrong because they were enforcing rules after the son acted out. \n\nBut since the son is 18, some might argue he should handle his responsibilities without such interventions. However, the parent's actions were in response to immediate threats and damage. So, the parent's actions are a reaction to the son's behavior, which complicates things. The parent isn't entirely at fault because they were trying to discipline an adult child who was being abusive. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
