Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the person who cut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation is about a father (49) who shut off the internet for his 18-year-old son who's been neglecting chores and playing too much League of Legends. The son was supposed to do housework but kept putting it off, and when the father cut the WiFi, the son reacted angrily with shouting, swearing, and even damaged the doorframe. The father then threatened the son about not being able to eat his food and made him fix the door. The son later left, and the parents are worried.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the father overstepped. The son is 18 and in university, living at home but not contributing much beyond some expenses. The father's actions were to enforce responsibility, but the son reacted violently. The father's main issue is the son's lack of contribution and addiction to gaming. \n\nThe father's decision to cut WiFi could be seen as a parenting tactic to enforce responsibility. However, the son's reaction was extreme. The father's response to the yelling (denying food) might be harsh, especially if the son is an adult but still living at home. However, since he's 18, there's a line between being a parent and respecting his autonomy. \n\nLegal age-wise, 18 is an adult, so maybe the father shouldn't control his internet access as a form of punishment. But the son isn't paying rent, so there's a dependency here. The father's actions might be justified in trying to teach responsibility, but the method could be questionable. The son's violent behavior (shouting, throwing, damaging property) is a red flag. The father's response to the shouting by cutting food might be seen as punitive and not proportionate. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father might be in the right in enforcing chores and responsibility, but his methods (cutting WiFi, food) could be seen as overstepping, especially considering the son's age. However, given the son's own behavior (swearing, damaging property), the father's actions are a reaction to that. The key is whether cutting WiFi is a reasonable method for an adult child. Since the son is still under the same roof, the parents might have the right to set boundaries. The damage caused by the son could warrant the father's response. \n\nBut the apple and food part might be harsh. However, considering the son's age, the father is trying to assert control. Overall, the father's actions are in response to the son's negligence and subsequent outburst. The son's violent reaction is definitely wrong, but the father's measures to enforce responsibility could be seen as necessary. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The father's actions are a form of parental control, but since the son is an adult, maybe the methods are a bit too strict. However, given the context of the son's behavior, it's a tough call. The father's actions are a reaction to the son's disrespect, so maybe he's justified. Answer B.\n"
