Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's in university, living at home, and not contributing enough to housework. The parent turned off the WiFi to enforce responsibility, leading to a conflict where the son yelled, swore, and caused damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. They had a valid reason: the son wasn't doing his chores and was prioritizing gaming. The parent felt the WiFi cutoff was necessary to push the son to help. But the son's reaction was extreme\u2014yelling, swearing, and damaging property. The parent then took further steps like cutting off food access, which might be crossing a line.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention was to teach responsibility. The son, being an adult, should have known better, but his reaction was out of control. The parent's actions could be seen as necessary to enforce boundaries, but the method (cutting WiFi and food) might be harsh. The key here is whether the parent overstepped, especially since the son is an adult. Taking away the WiFi is a common parental tactic with teenagers, but cutting off food is more severe. The parent might have felt justified in protecting family members, especially the daughter with Asperger's. However, the physical damage to the door frame is a result of the son's actions, and making him fix it makes sense. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent's response to the son's yelling by cutting off food access could be seen as punitive beyond what's reasonable. Also, the son's reaction indicates he's in a bad mental state, which the parent might not have considered. The parent's actions might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The fact that the son later washed the car shows he might be trying to make amends, but the parent is still conflicted.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, parents often use WiFi cutoff as a disciplinary measure, but cutting off food is more extreme. The parent's mental state (affected by recent tragedies) might add context, but it doesn't excuse harsh actions. The son's addiction to gaming and lack of responsibility are issues, but the parent's methods might have contributed to the son's emotional breakdown.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? They had good intentions but used methods that could be seen as too harsh, especially cutting off access to food. The WiFi cutoff is common, but the food access is more severe. Also, damaging the door frame was the son's fault, but making him fix it is reasonable. The parent's actions might be justified in part, but the combination of methods could be seen as excessive. Therefore, the answer is A (the parent is in the wrong) because their punitive measures went beyond typical discipline, especially with an adult child.\n"
