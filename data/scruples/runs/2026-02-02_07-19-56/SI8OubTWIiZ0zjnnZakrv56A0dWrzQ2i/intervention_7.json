Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent cutting off their son's WiFi because he wasn't doing his chores. The son got angry, yelled, and caused damage. The parent then took further actions, like blocking WiFi and taking away the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 18, in his second year of university, living at home without contributing much except for clothes, bus money, and spending. The parent is dealing with emotional stress due to recent events in their hometown. The parent tried to get the son to do chores, but the son was in a League of Legends game. The parent then disconnected the WiFi, leading to a confrontation where the son yelled, swore, threw an apple, and damaged the door.\n\nThe parent's actions: cutting off WiFi, which is a common parenting tactic to enforce responsibilities. But the son's reaction was aggressive. The parent then told him he couldn't eat their food if he continued that behavior. The son's escalation led to property damage.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might see it differently. The parent's intention was to enforce responsibility. However, the son's age and the parent's response need to be considered. At 18, the son is an adult, so cutting off WiFi might be seen as a reasonable measure. But the parent's response to the son's aggression\u2014telling him he can't eat their food\u2014could be seen as withholding basic needs, though it's food for a grown adult who isn't paying rent or contributing much. However, the son's behavior was unacceptable, so the parent might feel justified.\n\nThe son's actions were disrespectful and destructive. The parent's response might be seen as necessary to set boundaries. However, disconnecting WiFi and then cutting off food (which is a bit harsh if the son is living under their roof without contributing) could be a point of contention. Also, the parent took away the door after it was damaged, which might be a form of punishment. But since the son caused the damage, making him fix it is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of the parent's actions, cutting WiFi to enforce chores is a common method. The parent handled it in a way that might be seen as justified given the son's behavior. However, the parent's threat about food could be problematic if the son is dependent on them for meals. But since he's an adult, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nThe key factors are: the son's age, his responsibility (or lack thereof), the parent's emotional state, and the son's aggressive reaction. The parent's actions might be seen as a reasonable attempt to maintain household rules, especially when the son's behavior was inconsiderate and harmful. The damage caused by the son might support the parent's need to set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might not be in the wrong. Their actions were a response to the son's unacceptable behavior. However, some might argue that cutting off WiFi and food is harsh, especially for an adult. But given the context of the son's actions, it's a matter of perspective. The parent's intent was to enforce responsibility and protect the household environment. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
