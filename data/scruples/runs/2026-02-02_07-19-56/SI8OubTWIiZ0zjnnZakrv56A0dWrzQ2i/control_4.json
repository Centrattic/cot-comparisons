Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves their 18-year-old son who's not contributing to housework, is playing a game, and there's been some conflict leading to the dad cutting the WiFi.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're trying to get their son to help with chores, which is reasonable. The son is living at home, not paying rent except for some expenses, so maybe the parents expect more responsibility. The dad was already upset due to a traumatic event in his hometown, which might have affected his mood.\n\nThe son was in a game and didn't help when asked. The parents gave him a warning about cutting the WiFi if he didn't help. He responded by threatening not to help if the WiFi was cut. The dad then disconnected the router. The son reacted angrily, shouted, and did some damage. The dad then told him he can't eat their food anymore, leading to more conflict.\n\nNow, is the dad in the wrong? Well, cutting WiFi is a common parental control tactic, but the son is 18 and an adult. The dad's actions might be seen as overstepping since the son is an adult. However, the son's behavior was defiant and disrespectful, including yelling, swearing, and damaging property. The dad's response to take away food access might cross a line, but he could be trying to enforce accountability.\n\nThe key points here are the son's age and independence. The dad might be trying to enforce responsibility, but the methods used could be too harsh. However, considering the son's disrespectful actions, the dad might feel justified in protecting his home and family. There's also the emotional toll on the daughter with OCD and Aspergers, which adds to the stress.\n\nIn terms of legal and societal norms, parents can set rules in their household, but when a child is 18, they're adults. The dad's actions might be seen as reasonable for maintaining household rules, but the escalation (taking away food, not allowing access to the home) could be problematic. However, since the son is living under their roof, the parents have some authority. The final answer depends on whether the dad's actions were a proportionate response to the son's behavior.\n"
