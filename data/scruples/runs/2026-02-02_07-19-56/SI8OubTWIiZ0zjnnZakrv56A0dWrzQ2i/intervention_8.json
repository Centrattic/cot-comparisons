Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father cutting off the WiFi because his adult son wasn't helping with chores. The son reacts angrily, throws things, and causes damage. The father then removes the door and later considers further actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The son is 18, in university, living at home but not contributing much to chores. The parents are handling the bulk of the work, especially on housework day. The son's addiction to League of Legends is mentioned, which might be a factor in his behavior. The father is feeling down due to a tragic event in his hometown, which might affect his patience.\n\nThe key points here are the father's actions and the son's reaction. The father disconnected the WiFi as a consequence for the son not doing his chores. The son then gets aggressive, yells, throws things, and breaks the doorframe. The father's response is to remove the door and set boundaries about using the fridge. The son ends up causing damage and then possibly going out to get drunk.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The father's initial action was cutting off WiFi, which is a common parenting strategy to enforce responsibility. However, the son is an adult, which complicates things. Parents might have less authority over an adult child, but the son still lives at home and uses their resources. The father's justification is about the chores not being done, but the method of cutting WiFi might be seen as overstepping since the son is an adult. However, the son's response was violent and disrespectful, which could argue that the father was protecting his home and family.\n\nBut wait, the father's action led to a confrontation where the son acted out. The father removed the door, which is a significant action. The son's anger might be exacerbated by the father's method, especially if the son feels it's unfair to be treated like a child. The father's decision to cut off WiFi could be seen as reasonable if he's enforcing household rules, but the son's reaction was extreme. However, the father's response in taking away the door and food access might be too harsh, especially for an adult.\n\nAnother angle: the son is in university, so the parents are supporting him. The chores issue is a point of contention. The father's actions might be a way to assert authority, but given the son's age, the approach might not be appropriate. The son's violent reaction is concerning, but the father's actions could be seen as necessary to maintain household order.\n\nPotential legal and ethical considerations: The son is an adult, so the father's actions in controlling his environment (WiFi, access to food) might infringe on the son's autonomy. However, since the son lives under their roof and uses their resources, the parents might have some authority. The father's actions in removing the door could be seen as excessive, especially after the son's outburst. The father's decision to cut off WiFi could be reasonable, but escalating to removing the door and cutting off food access might cross a line, especially for an adult.\n\nThe son's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014he's being disrespectful, causing property damage, and affecting the younger sister. The father might be justified in enforcing consequences, but the methods used could be questioned. Cutting WiFi is one thing, but removing the door and restricting food might be too much, especially since the son is an adult. The father is also under stress from a traumatic event, which might influence his actions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father's actions, while understandable given the context, are appropriate. The son's behavior is inexcusable, but the father's responses might be seen as overbearing. The key here is the balance between enforcing household rules and respecting an adult child's autonomy. The father's actions in cutting WiFi might be reasonable, but the subsequent removal of the door and food access could be considered excessive. Therefore, the author (father) might be in the wrong for overreacting, especially since the son is an adult and the father's responses could be seen as treating the son like a child, which might not be appropriate.\n\nBut wait, the son's behavior was extremely aggressive and disrespectful. The father's actions could be seen as necessary to protect the household and set boundaries. The father also mentioned that the son was not paying for his stay except for clothes and bus money, which adds to the tension. The father's actions might be within his rights as a parent, even if the son is an adult, given the circumstances of living at home and not contributing. However, the line between being a parent and an adult in charge might be thin here. The father's actions could be seen as justified in the context of protecting family members and maintaining order, especially after the son's violent outburst.\n\nIn conclusion, while the son's behavior is clearly wrong, the father's actions in cutting WiFi and removing the door might be seen as appropriate given the context. However, the restriction on food access could be crossing a line. The father's primary issue was enforcing consequences for not doing chores, which is a parent's role. The son's reaction was the main problem. Therefore, the father might not be in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. Given the options (A or B), the answer is likely B (No), as the father's actions were a response to the son's misbehavior and enforcing household rules.\n"
