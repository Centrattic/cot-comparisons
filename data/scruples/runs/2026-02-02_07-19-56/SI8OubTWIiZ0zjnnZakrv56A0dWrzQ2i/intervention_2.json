Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The story is about a parent who disconnected the internet because their 18-year-old son wasn't doing his chores. The son was in the middle of a League of Legends game and got angry. The parent then took away the WiFi and later refused the son access to their food when he yelled. The son threw an apple, kicked things, and damaged the doorframe. The parent is now considering further actions like blocking the son's devices or removing the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's actions. The parent was dealing with their son not contributing to household chores, which is a common issue. The son is 18, living at home, and not paying for much beyond his own expenses. The parent had asked the son to do tasks, but he was dismissive. The parent then took the router offline, leading to an argument and the son's outburst.\n\nIs the parent in the wrong? Well, the parent's intention was to enforce responsibility by cutting off internet access, which is a common consequence for not meeting responsibilities. However, the son's reaction was extreme\u2014shouting, swearing, damaging property. The parent then went further by denying food, which might be seen as an overreaction. Also, taking away the WiFi without a prior agreement might be harsh, but the parent had warned the son that cutting the WiFi would happen if he didn't comply.\n\nThe son's behavior is unacceptably aggressive, especially with the daughter who has OCD and Aspergers being targeted. The parent's response to the son's aggression by removing food access could be seen as a form of punishment, but it's important to consider if that's appropriate. However, the parent did step in to protect their daughter, which is right.\n\nThe parent is now considering removing the son's devices or the door. At 18, the son is an adult, but still living at home. The parent's actions might be seen as necessary to enforce accountability, but the extreme reaction from the son complicates it. The parent's own emotional state (due to a traumatic event in their hometown) might have influenced their actions, but that's a personal factor.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parent's initial act of cutting WiFi could be justified to enforce chores, but the escalation (denying food) might be excessive. However, the son's aggression and property damage are serious. The parent's actions were in response to both the son's neglect of chores and the aggressive behavior. The parent did make an effort to address the behavior, even involving the wife to calm things down.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent might not be in the wrong because they were trying to enforce household rules and protect their daughter. The son's actions were clearly wrong, but the parent's response could be seen as a necessary measure to maintain order. The key is whether cutting off WiFi was a reasonable consequence. If the parent had established clear rules beforehand, it might be more justified. However, since it's a sudden action without prior agreement, it might be seen as harsh. But given the context, the parent's actions seem more in line with a parent trying to manage a difficult situation. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
