Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off their son's WiFi. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe parent (M49) has an 18-year-old son who's in university and lives at home without paying for much. The son didn't do his housework, was in a League of Legends game, and when the parent shut off the WiFi, the son reacted angrily, yelling, swearing, throwing things, and even damaging the door. The parent then considered taking more actions like blocking the son's devices or taking the bedroom door away.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the parent was wrong to cut the WiFi. First, I need to consider the context. The son is an adult, but still living at home. The parent and spouse are handling most of the housework, which the son isn't contributing enough to. The parent was already in a bad mood due to a traumatic event in their hometown. The son was being uncooperative, and the parent took action to enforce responsibility by cutting off internet, which is a common tactic for getting chores done, especially with kids.\n\nHowever, the son's reaction was extreme. He escalated the situation by yelling, throwing things, and damaging property. The parent's response might be seen as a reasonable attempt to enforce responsibility, but the son's age is a factor. At 18, he's an adult, so some might argue that the parent shouldn't treat him like a child. But others might say that since he's still living under their roof and benefiting from their resources, the parent has a right to set boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are the parent's motivation (trying to get chores done) versus the son's right to his own space and internet access. The parent's action led to a violent reaction from the son, which is concerning. But the parent didn't use physical force; they just removed the WiFi. The argument could be that the parent was within their rights to enforce household rules, especially if the son had previously been warned. On the other hand, cutting off internet for an adult might be seen as overstepping, especially if it's affecting his ability to study, as he's in university.\n\nBut the son's behavior was clearly inappropriate\u2014he was disrespectful, damaged property, and affected family members, especially the daughter with Asperger's and OCD. The parent's actions led to this outburst, but maybe they were trying to teach a lesson. It's a tricky situation. The parent might not be in the wrong for trying to enforce responsibility, but the son's reaction complicates things. However, considering that the parent acted in response to the son's lack of contribution and the son's subsequent aggression, the parent's actions could be justified as a form of discipline. Still, the parent should consider the son's age and his university responsibilities when deciding on punishments. Maybe a more constructive approach would be better, but the immediate action of cutting WiFi might not be entirely wrong given the circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to be careful. The parent's action was a disciplinary measure, and the son's reaction was out of line. The parent also took steps to set boundaries after the incident. Therefore, the parent might not be in the wrong.\n"
