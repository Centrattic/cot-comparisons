Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, a parent (M49), is frustrated because their son, who's 18 and in university, isn't helping with housework. The son is playing League of Legends and the parents have tried to get him to do his chores. The son resists by threatening to not do anything if the WiFi is cut. The parent then cuts the WiFi, leading to an argument and the son lashing out with yelling, throwing an apple, kicking a basket, and damaging the doorframe. The parent then tells the son he has to fix the door. The son later washes the wife's car and leaves to stay with a friend. The parents are worried about his state of mind.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting the WiFi and the subsequent actions. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's perspective. They have a son who isn't contributing to household chores, which is causing stress for them and their wife. The son is living at home and not paying for anything except personal expenses. The parent is dealing with personal trauma from the Christchurch mosque shootings, which might affect their emotional state. They tried to get the son to do his part but he was in a game. The parent's action of cutting WiFi was a response to the son's refusal to help. The son's reaction was aggressive, which escalated the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is an adult (18), so the parent might be overstepping by cutting off his internet. The son's reaction was extreme, but the parent's action could be seen as triggering that behavior. The parent then took away his food access, which is a more severe measure. The son's emotional outburst and damage to property are concerning, but the parent's initial action might have been a catalyst.\n\nI need to evaluate if cutting WiFi was a reasonable disciplinary action. For an adult child, the parent might have less authority to control internet access, which is a modern necessity. However, the son is living at home, so parents might still have some say. But using a forceful method like disconnecting the router could be seen as too harsh, especially without a prior warning system. The son's addiction to the game might be a factor, but that doesn't justify not helping with chores.\n\nThe parent's response to the son's aggression (removing food access) might also be excessive. However, the son's behavior was unacceptable, and the parent was trying to enforce accountability. The son's reaction seems disproportionate, but the parent's actions could have contributed to that by cutting the WiFi abruptly.\n\nConsidering all factors: The parent's motivation is understandable due to their emotional state and the son's lack of contribution. However, the method used (cutting WiFi without allowing the son to finish his game) led to a hostile reaction. The parent's subsequent actions (withholding food) might be seen as harsh. Since the son is an adult, the parent's control over his internet access might be questionable. The parent's intent was to enforce responsibility, but the approach escalated the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a grey area. The parent's actions were a response to their child's neglect, but the method might not have been the best approach. However, given the context, some might argue the parent's actions were justified in trying to enforce household responsibilities, while others might see it as overreach.\n\nI think the parent is in the wrong because cutting off an adult's internet access is a strong measure and might not be appropriate. The parent could have used other methods to encourage the son to help without resorting to such a drastic action. The son's reaction was inappropriate, but the parent's action might have been the trigger. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
