Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parent (a father in New Zealand) shuts off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son isn't doing his housework. The son is in university, lives at home, and doesn't pay for anything except clothes, bus money, and spending. The father had a tough time due to a traumatic event in his hometown, which might have affected his mood.\n\nThe son was in a League of Legends game when asked to help. He didn't start immediately, and when threatened with WiFi cutoff, he responded that he wouldn't help if the WiFi was cut. The father then disconnects the router, leading to an argument where the son yells, swears, throws an apple, kicks over a basket, and damages the door frame. The father then tells the son he has to fix the door. The son later washed the wife's car and stayed at a friend's place.\n\nThe father is now considering cutting off the son's internet access permanently or removing his bedroom door. He's unsure if he's in the wrong (AITA), HTA, or NTA.\n\nNow, from a typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" perspective, the key points are:\n\n1. **Parental Authority vs. Adult Child's Rights**: The son is 18 and in university, which in many places means he's an adult. The parents might still have influence, but the son's autonomy is a factor. The father's actions (cutting WiFi, restricting access) might be seen as overstepping if the son isn't a minor anymore.\n\n2. **Proportionality of Response**: The father's initial action (cutting WiFi) is a common parental tactic, but the son's reaction (shouting, swearing, vandalism) escalated the situation. The father's response to restrict food and mention removing the door could be seen as harsh, especially after the son's outburst.\n\n3. **Emotional Context**: The father was dealing with trauma from a recent shooting in his hometown. This could affect his judgment and response. However, that doesn't necessarily justify his actions, but it's a mitigating factor.\n\n4. **Consequences**: The son's behavior was aggressive, but the father's actions may have triggered it. The son's reaction (vandalizing the door) is definitely problematic, but the father's handling might have contributed to the escalation.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, if the parent is using reasonable methods to enforce responsibility, they might be NTA. However, if the methods are overly harsh or if the parent's actions led to the son's outburst, they might be AITA.\n\nIn this case, the father's decision to cut WiFi is a common tactic, but the subsequent restriction of food and threats about the door might be crossing a line, especially with an adult child. The son's response was clearly inappropriate, but the father's response could be seen as contributing to the conflict. The father's actions might be seen as a parent trying to enforce responsibility, but the methods and escalation could be considered overly harsh for an adult.\n\nSo, considering the parent's authority versus the adult child's autonomy and the proportionality of the response, the father might be in the wrong for escalating the situation beyond a reasonable disciplinary action. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
