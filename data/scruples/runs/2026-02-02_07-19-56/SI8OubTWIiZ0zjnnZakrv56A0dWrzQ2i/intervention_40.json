Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent disconnecting their 18-year-old son's WiFi because he wasn't doing his housework. The son got upset, yelled, and even damaged the door. Now the parent is considering further consequences.\n\nFirst, the parent's actions: they shut off the WiFi after the son refused to help with chores. The son is in university and lives at home without contributing much financially. The parent was also dealing with emotional distress from a recent tragedy in their hometown. \n\nThe parent's justification is that the son isn't pulling his weight, and they wanted to enforce some responsibility. However, using the WiFi as a punishment might be seen as harsh, especially since it's a common resource. The son's reaction escalated into yelling, swearing, and property damage, which complicates things. The parent then threatened the son's access to food and considered taking away the door. \n\nNow, considering the son's age, 18 is an adult, and while living at home, parents might still have some authority, but there's a line. The parent's actions led to a confrontation and damage. The question is whether the parent overstepped. \n\nPossible angles: The parent might be seen as trying to enforce responsibility, which is reasonable. But cutting off a shared resource (WiFi) could be unfair, especially if others in the house use it. Also, the response to the son's anger\u2014threatening food and taking the door\u2014might be overly harsh. The parent's emotional state from the recent tragedy might affect their judgment, but that doesn't excuse the actions. \n\nThe son's behavior was definitely inappropriate, but the parent's actions could have been handled more calmly. Maybe discussing consequences earlier or using a different method. The parent's follow-up threats (removing the door) might be crossing into punishment territory that's too extreme for an adult child. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? It's a tough call. They had a valid concern about chores, but their method and the escalation could be seen as excessive. The son's response was inconsiderate, but the parent's actions might have been the catalyst. The answer depends on cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. But in many cases, cutting off WiFi and threatening food access might be seen as overreaching. So leaning towards the parent is not in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. The parent's actions were harsh, but they were trying to enforce household rules. The son's behavior was worse, so the parent's response might be justified as a form of discipline, even if not the best approach.\n"
