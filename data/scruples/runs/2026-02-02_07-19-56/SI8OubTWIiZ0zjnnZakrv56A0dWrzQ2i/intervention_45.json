Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. The situation involves an 18-year-old son who's in university, living at home, and not contributing enough to housework. The parents are upset because he's not doing his share, especially on housework day, and they're dealing with personal grief from a recent tragedy.\n\nFirst, consider the parents' actions. The father disconnected the WiFi because the son was prioritizing gaming over chores. The son became aggressive, yelling, swearing, and even damaged property. The parents then had to deal with the aftermath, including the son's destructive behavior and the youngest daughter being affected. The parents feel justified in their actions to enforce responsibility.\n\nNow, the son is an adult, so there's a line about parental authority. While he's still living at home, parents might expect certain responsibilities. However, cutting off WiFi without communication or a discussion might be seen as harsh. On the other hand, the son's reaction was extreme, escalating the situation. The parents might be protecting their home and family from further harm. \n\nThe key points are: the son's failure to meet responsibilities, the parents' attempt to enforce accountability, and the son's violent response. The parents' actions led to a conflict, but the son's escalation is significant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The parents might be justified in enforcing chores, but the method (cutting WiFi abruptly) could have been handled better. However, given the son's aggressive reaction, the parents are trying to maintain order. The community might split on this, but considering the son's behavior, the parents might not be in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
