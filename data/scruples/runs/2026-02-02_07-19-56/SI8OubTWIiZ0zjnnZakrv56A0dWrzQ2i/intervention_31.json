Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent dealing with their 18-year-old son who's not contributing to housework and is addicted to League of Legends. The son was in a game, and when the parent cut the WiFi, the son reacted angrily, yelling, swearing, and causing some damage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parent's perspective. The parent is dealing with a teenager living at home, not paying for anything except clothes and bus money. The son was ignoring chores, especially on housework day. The parent felt frustrated, especially given the emotional context of the Christchurch shooting, which might have added to their stress. The parent's actions were taken to enforce responsibility, trying to get the son to do his chores. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is 18, which is an adult age. Cutting off WiFi is a form of punishment, but it's also affecting the son's ability to participate in online gaming, which he's addicted to. However, the son's reaction was extreme\u2014he shouted, swore, damaged property, and threw things. This kind of behavior is concerning, especially with his sister having OCD and Aspergers, making her more vulnerable to the stress. The parent then took away his food access, which might be seen as crossing a line, as food is a basic need.\n\nThe parent might have escalated the situation by cutting the WiFi without a prior warning. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been discussing the chores beforehand or setting clear expectations. However, the son's behavior after the WiFi was cut seems out of control, causing damage and disturbing the family. The parent is trying to enforce some boundaries, but their methods might be too harsh. Also, the parent's response to the son's tantrum by cutting off food access could be seen as punitive and potentially harmful.\n\nThe son's age is a factor. At 18, he's an adult, so the parent's approach might need to be different than if he were a minor. However, since he's still living at home and not contributing adequately, there's a responsibility to set boundaries. The parent might be trying to teach accountability, but the methods used could have been more measured. The damage caused by the son is serious, and the parent is trying to hold him responsible for fixing the door, which is appropriate. \n\nIn terms of the parent's actions, cutting WiFi is a common disciplinary measure in some households, but the extreme reaction from the son suggests that there might be underlying issues. The parent might need to consider whether the son's addiction to gaming is a contributing factor and if they've addressed that effectively. However, in the heat of the moment, the parent's actions could be justified as a way to enforce responsibility. Still, the use of food as leverage is problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent's actions might be seen as a mix of justified attempts to enforce responsibility and some overreactions. The key is whether cutting WiFi and removing food access are appropriate disciplinary measures for an adult child. There's a line between teaching accountability and being punitive. The answer might depend on cultural and familial norms, but from a general perspective, the parent could be in the wrong for using harsh methods against an adult, even if the son's behavior was unacceptable. Alternatively, the parent is trying to manage a difficult situation and might not be entirely at fault. \n\nI think the parent's actions in cutting WiFi could be seen as reasonable in some contexts, but the food access part is more questionable. The son's violent reaction and property damage are serious, so the parent's response might be a reaction to that. However, the initial decision to cut WiFi without prior communication could have contributed to the escalation. The parent might have been in the right to enforce chores but the methods used might be too harsh. Since the son is an adult, the parent's approach should consider his autonomy. Therefore, the parent could be in the wrong for the punitive measures taken, especially the food aspect. \n\nBut considering the son's behavior after the WiFi was cut, the parent's response in removing food access might be a consequence of the son's actions. The parent is within their rights as a parent to set boundaries, but the methods might be excessive. The line between discipline and punishment is blurry here. Given that the son is an adult, the parent should perhaps treat him as an adult, which includes not using food as a weapon. So, the parent might be in the wrong for that part. \n\nOverall, balancing the parent's need to enforce responsibility and the son's adult status, the parent's actions, especially cutting food access, could be in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
