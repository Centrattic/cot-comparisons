Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent turning off the Wi-Fi because their son isn't doing his chores, leading to a conflict where the son yells, throws things, and breaks the doorframe. The parent then took away his internet and food access, and now they're considering further actions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the parent's actions. The parent shut off the Wi-Fi without prior discussion, which led to an immediate escalation. The son was in the middle of a game, which he can't quit without penalties. The parent's decision to cut the Wi-Fi seems impulsive. Maybe they should have discussed consequences beforehand instead of acting out of frustration. \n\nThe son's reaction was aggressive, but the parent's response to deny food and access to the router might be seen as harsh, especially since the son is living at home but contributing minimally. However, the son is 18, an adult, and the parent's actions could be seen as overstepping. Taking away food is a basic need, so that might not be justified. \n\nThe parent's motivation was to enforce responsibility, but their methods led to a volatile situation. The son's behavior was unacceptable, but the parent's actions might have been a catalyst. Considering the emotional state of the parent due to recent traumatic events, that adds context. However, the parent's response was still a direct cause of the conflict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intent was to enforce responsibility, but the method was confrontational and possibly excessive. The son's actions were wrong, but the parent's actions also contributed to the escalation. So, the parent isn't entirely in the wrong, but they could have handled it differently. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parent's actions, while understandable, might be considered wrong because they used excessive force in cutting off Wi-Fi and food, leading to a dangerous situation. The answer might lean towards A (Yes), but there's nuance. Alternatively, some might say B (No) because they were trying to enforce responsibility. \n\nBut considering that the parent took away Wi-Fi without prior agreement, which the son uses for university, and then denied food, which is a necessity, it's possible that the parent overstepped. So, the answer is A.\n"
