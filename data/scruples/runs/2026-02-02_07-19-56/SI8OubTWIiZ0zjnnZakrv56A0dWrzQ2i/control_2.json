Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. So the situation is about a parent dealing with their 18-year-old son who isn't doing his share of housework and is addicted to gaming. The son is in university but lives at home without paying much. The parent, who's from New Zealand and is feeling down after a traumatic event in their hometown, decided to cut the WiFi to get the son to help. The son reacted angrily, shouting, swearing, and causing damage. The parent now is considering further actions like blocking the WiFi for his devices or taking away the door.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the parent's actions were justified. The parent had a valid reason\u2014the son wasn't doing his chores, and the parent was trying to enforce responsibility. The son was in a game, which he couldn't leave without penalties, so cutting WiFi might have been a way to make him act. But the parent's method of cutting the WiFi immediately might have been a bit abrupt. However, parents do have the right to set boundaries for their children, even adults living at home, regarding household responsibilities.\n\nThe son's reaction was extreme: yelling, swearing, throwing things, damaging the door. The parent's response was to take away internet and then the food access, which are reasonable consequences to teach accountability. The parent also had to handle the situation where the youngest daughter was affected, so sending her upstairs to protect her is understandable. \n\nThe parent is now worried about the son's state of mind, but the son's behavior was clearly problematic. The actions taken by the parent were in response to the son's lack of responsibility and the resulting confrontation. There's no indication that the parent overstepped; instead, they tried to enforce household rules. The parent's emotional state due to the recent traumatic events might explain their motivation to take action, but that doesn't make their actions wrong.\n\nTherefore, the parent's actions were a reasonable attempt to enforce household responsibilities and maintain order. The son's behavior was the problem, not the parent's response. So the answer should be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
