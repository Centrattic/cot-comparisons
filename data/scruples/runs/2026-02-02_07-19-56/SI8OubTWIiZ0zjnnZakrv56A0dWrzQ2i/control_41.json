Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent (M49) who shuts off the WiFi because his 18-year-old son isn't doing his housework. The son was in the middle of a League of Legends game and refused to help, leading to a confrontation. The parent then disconnects the WiFi, which results in the son yelling, swearing, throwing an apple, kicking over a basket, and damaging the doorframe. The parent is now considering further actions like blocking the son's devices or taking away the door.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the parent's actions. The parent was already dealing with emotional distress due to a tragic event in their hometown. They asked the son multiple times to help with chores, which the son ignored because of his game. The parent felt justified in cutting the WiFi to enforce responsibility. But the son's reaction was aggressive, leading to property damage and emotional distress for the daughter. \n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. On one hand, the parent is trying to enforce household responsibilities, which is reasonable. The son is an adult living at home without contributing, so the parent might feel entitled to set boundaries. However, the method of cutting off WiFi, especially without prior clear consequences, might be seen as harsh. The son's mental health could be a factor\u2014his reaction was extreme, but does that mean the parent should have handled it differently?\n\nThe parent's response after the incident, like telling the son to fix the door and not allowing him to eat without buying his own food, seems to be about accountability. But the initial act of cutting WiFi led to a violent outburst. Was the parent within their rights to do that, or did they overstep? Maybe there's a middle ground. For example, setting a time limit for the game instead of cutting WiFi entirely. The son's addiction to gaming is a problem, but the parent's approach might have triggered a worse response.\n\nAlso, the son is 18 and an adult. The parent might need to consider whether controlling WiFi access is appropriate for an adult child. However, since he's still living at home, parents might still impose certain rules. The key issue is whether the parent's method was proportionate. The son's behavior was unacceptable, but the parent's action might have been a catalyst. So, is the parent in the wrong for cutting WiFi, leading to the son's outburst, or is the son responsible for his own reaction?\n\nIn terms of accountability, the parent's intention was to enforce chores, which is valid. The son's response was inappropriate. But the parent's method could have been handled better. Maybe a time-out for the game instead of cutting WiFi, or discussing consequences beforehand. However, in the heat of the moment, the parent acted to enforce the rule. The parent's actions might be seen as justified, given the son's lack of responsibility. Alternatively, the parent might have overreacted, leading to the son's escalation.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to enforce household rules, but the method might have been too abrupt. The son's behavior is clearly problematic, but the parent's action could be seen as a reasonable attempt to enforce accountability. So, the answer might lean towards B (the parent is not in the wrong), but there's room for debate. The parent's action was a trigger, but the son's response was extreme. The parent's intent was to get the son to help, which is a parent's right even if the child is 18. Therefore, the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
