Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for cutting off the WiFi. The situation is complicated. The father (author) has an 18-year-old son who's in university, lives at home, and doesn't contribute enough to housework. The son is playing League of Legends and not doing his chores. The father, who's feeling down due to a traumatic event in his hometown, decides to shut off the WiFi to get the son to help. The son reacts angrily, yells, throws things, breaks the doorframe, and then leaves. The dad is now considering whether to block the son's devices or take the door away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the father's actions. He shut off the WiFi without prior discussion, which the son was relying on for his game. The son's response was aggressive, but the father's motivation was to enforce responsibility. However, cutting off internet access abruptly could be seen as an authoritarian move. The son is 18 and an adult, so maybe the approach should be more about negotiation rather than punishment. The father's method might have been too harsh, leading to the son's outburst. The son's reaction is extreme, but maybe the father's action triggered it. The father also took away internet and then food, which could be seen as excessive. The daughter with OCD and Asperger's was affected too, which adds to the stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the father has legitimate concerns about household responsibilities. The son isn't contributing, and the father is dealing with personal grief. The son's addiction to gaming is a problem. However, the way the father handled it might not be the best approach. Instead of cutting off WiFi, maybe setting clear expectations and consequences would be better. The father's actions led to a breakdown in communication and increased conflict.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. The son's behavior is clearly problematic, but the father's method of shutting off WiFi without considering alternative solutions might be at fault. The father could have had a conversation, set boundaries, or involved the mother more. The immediate escalation by cutting WiFi and then taking away food might be seen as overreacting. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions, while understandable, were too harsh and contributed to the conflict.\n"
