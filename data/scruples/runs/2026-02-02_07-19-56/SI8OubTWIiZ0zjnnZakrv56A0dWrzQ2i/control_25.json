Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe father, who's from New Zealand, had a tough time because of the mosque shootings in Christchurch. He's feeling down. The kids aren't doing enough housework, especially the 18-year-old son who's in university. The son is addicted to League of Legends and doesn't contribute much. On a Saturday morning, the father tries to get the son to help with chores. The son was in a game and said he'd do it, but then didn't. The wife threatens to cut the WiFi if he doesn't help. The son reacts by threatening not to do anything if the WiFi is cut. The father then disconnects the router, leading to a yelling match. The son throws an apple, kicks things, and breaks the doorframe. The father makes him fix it. Later, the son leaves and the parents are worried he's not in a good state.\n\nNow, to determine if the father is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The father's action was cutting the WiFi to enforce chores. The son was in a game, but he's an adult living at home without contributing. The father's motivation includes his emotional state from the shootings, which might affect his judgment. But the son's reaction was aggressive and destructive, which is concerning.\n\nThe question is whether the father overstepped. On one hand, the son is an adult but still under the family's roof. Parents might have some authority, but the method of cutting WiFi could be seen as extreme, especially leading to a violent outburst. The son's behavior escalated to physical destruction, which is bad, but the father's initial action might have triggered it. However, the son's refusal to help and the threats beforehand might justify the father's actions as a form of accountability.\n\nAlso, considering the son's age, even though he's 18, he's still a student and not contributing financially. The parents might feel justified in enforcing responsibilities. However, the way he shut off the WiFi without a prior discussion could be seen as abrupt. The father acted in the moment, possibly without considering alternatives. The resulting conflict escalated quickly, leading to the son's aggressive behavior.\n\nBut the son's response was disproportionate. Throwing things and breaking the doorframe is way over the top. The father's actions might have been a reaction to the son's prior refusal and threats. However, cutting WiFi might not be the best approach, especially if it leads to such a reaction. The father could have tried other methods first, like discussing terms for chores or setting a schedule. Instead, he took a strict measure that led to conflict.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the father might not be entirely at fault because the son's behavior was the immediate cause of the conflict. But the father's decision to cut the WiFi could be seen as contributing to the escalation. It's a bit of a gray area. The father might be right in wanting to enforce responsibility, but the method was harsh. Alternatively, the son's reaction was the bigger issue. The question is whether the father should have anticipated the violent response. Maybe he didn't consider that the son would react so negatively, so he could be in the right for trying to enforce chores but in the wrong for the method.\n\nBut overall, if the son is an adult, the parents need to balance accountability with respect. Cutting WiFi is a control method that might not be appropriate for an adult. The father could have had a conversation or set consequences that don't involve shutting down essential services. The son's behavior was clearly unacceptable, but the father's action might have been a misstep in handling the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the son's actions were more to blame, but the father's method might not be the best. However, the father's action is a form of parental control which is common in some families. But the son's response was extreme, so maybe the father isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the father's action caused the son's outburst, he might bear some responsibility. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B.\n"
