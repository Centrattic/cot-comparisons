Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a father who shut off the Wi-Fi because his 18-year-old son wasn't doing his housework. The son was playing League of Legends and refused to help, leading to a confrontation where the father cut the internet. The son then lashed out with yelling, swearing, and even damaged the doorframe. Now the father is considering further actions like blocking the son's devices or taking his bedroom door away.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The father's perspective: He's feeling down after a traumatic event in his hometown, and he's trying to manage household responsibilities. His son is an adult living at home without contributing much beyond his own expenses. The father is trying to enforce responsibility by cutting off Wi-Fi as a consequence. He also took away food access as a further measure when the son became abusive.\n\nThe son's perspective: He's an 18-year-old university student, possibly dealing with his own stress or addiction to gaming. He was in the middle of a game and didn't want to stop, leading to conflict. His reaction was aggressive, which is problematic, but maybe he's under pressure from school or personal issues. However, his behavior\u2014yelling, swearing, damaging property\u2014is clearly wrong.\n\nNow, was the father in the wrong? He took a firm action (cutting Wi-Fi) as a consequence for not doing chores. That seems reasonable as a parent trying to teach responsibility. However, escalating to cutting off food access might be harsh. Also, taking away his bedroom door seems extreme. The father's actions led to a volatile situation where the son lashed out, but the son's response was also inappropriate. \n\nThe key points here are the father's right as a parent to enforce rules and consequences, versus the son's maturity level. Since the son is 18, he should be held to adult standards. The father's initial action (cutting Wi-Fi) is a standard consequence for not fulfilling responsibilities. However, the way he handled the subsequent conflict might have been more confrontational than necessary. \n\nBut considering the son's violent behavior towards family members, including the sister with Asperger's and OCD, the father's response in removing access to food could be seen as a necessary step to enforce boundaries after abuse. However, the father's actions might have contributed to the escalation by being too strict without perhaps considering the son's mental health or the context of the son being a university student. \n\nIn terms of whether the father is in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. He had a right to enforce house rules, but his methods may have been too harsh. However, the son's aggressive behavior definitely places some responsibility on him. The father's actions were a response to the son's failure to contribute, but cutting off the Wi-Fi and then food access might cross a line. However, in some parenting approaches, these are seen as necessary consequences. \n\nConsidering all factors, the father isn't entirely in the wrong because he's trying to maintain household responsibilities and discipline. However, his methods could be debated. The son's actions were definitely wrong, but the father's response might have been too extreme. The answer likely hinges on whether the father overstepped by cutting off food and damaging the door. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the story is from the father's perspective, the answer could be that he's not in the wrong (B), but some might argue he is (A). \n\nBut given that the son's behavior was abusive and the father was responding to that, the father's actions were a reaction to protect the household and enforce rules. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong). However, others might say the father was too harsh, especially with the food access and possible removal of the door. But in the AITA context, the community often considers the parent's actions as justified if they're enforcing rules, even if methods are strict. So, probably answer B.\n"
