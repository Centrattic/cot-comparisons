Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who shut off the WiFi) is in the wrong. The situation involves a 19-year-old son (he's 18 in the story but the incident happened on his 19th birthday maybe?) who's living at home, not contributing much to housework, and addicted to League of Legends. The parents are upset because he's not helping on housework day, and the father shuts off the WiFi to get him to comply. This leads to a confrontation where the son yells, throws things, and breaks the doorframe. The parents are now conflicted about how to respond.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The parents have a right to expect their children to contribute to household chores, especially since the son is an adult living at home without paying for much. The father's motivation was to get the son to help with chores by cutting off his internet, which is a common parenting strategy, though maybe extreme. However, the son's reaction was violent and disrespectful, which is concerning. The father's actions led to a loss of internet, which the son feared because of the gaming penalties. But when the son reacted aggressively, the father then cut off his access to food as well, which escalated the situation.\n\nThe father's initial action might be seen as a reasonable attempt to enforce responsibility, but the escalation (cutting off food) after the son's outburst could be problematic. The son's behavior was clearly inappropriate, but the parents' response might have contributed to the conflict. The key points here are about the proportionality of the father's actions. Cutting WiFi is one thing, but cutting off food access and then the son's subsequent destructive behavior complicates things. The father might have overreacted by taking away the food, which could be seen as punitive beyond the initial issue of chores.\n\nAlso, considering the son's age, as an adult, he should have some autonomy. However, since he's still living at home and the parents are providing for him, they might feel it's their right to enforce house rules. But the method of enforcing those rules (cutting off internet and food) might be too harsh. The parents are worried about his mental state after the incident, which suggests that their actions might have negative consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's refusal to help, the disrespectful behavior, and the destruction of property are clear wrongdoings. The father's actions were a response to that, but the way he handled it could be seen as contributing to the problem. The question is whether the father's response was justified. Since the son was an adult, perhaps the father should have found a different way to encourage responsibility without using such drastic measures. The fact that the son has mental health issues (OCD and Aspergers) might also play a role in how the parents should handle the situation.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually considers intent and proportionality. The father's intent was to get the son to help, which is reasonable. However, the method of cutting the WiFi and then the food might be seen as too harsh, especially leading to a violent reaction. The father's decision to cut off food as punishment after the son's outburst could be seen as crossing a line. The son's actions were definitely in the wrong, but the father's response may have been overly punitive, contributing to the escalation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the father might be partially in the wrong for escalating the situation with the food restriction, even if the initial WiFi cut was a reaction to the son's neglect. The son's behavior was unacceptable, but the father's response might have made things worse. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his actions escalated the conflict unnecessarily.\n"
