Wifey &amp; I are often still finishing after dark. Son (18) is also addicted to league of legends. He is 2nd year university and lives at home without paying for anything except his clothes, bus money &amp; spending.\n\nI (M49) got started about 8am this morning (Saturday). Didn\u2019t feel very motivated because I\u2019m in NZ, yesterday was the day 49 people were gunned down at their Mosques and Christchurch is my home town so I\u2019m feeling pretty down. At about 9:30 I knocked on his door to ask if he could start on his jobs &amp; empty the dishwasher. He was in a game &amp; said yeah yeah.\n\nNo sign of him and an hour later my wife said she\u2019d just asked him and he said he was in the middle of a game. She told him she\u2019d get me to cut the wifi if he didn\u2019t start helping and he said if she did that he wouldn\u2019t be doing anything. (Once a game starts you can\u2019t quit without risking a stand down for several days).\n\nWhen I heard that I went straight to the router, disconnected the power cable &amp; put it away. A minute or two later he starts yelling from downstairs. I went down there and he begins shouting and swearing at me (f***ing this &amp; that). I told him calmly he had just lost internet until I decided to give it back &amp; so of course he escalated the shouting. I went back upstairs feeling very bruised.\n\nHe was up within 5 mins, went to the fridge &amp; got an apple. I told him if he was going to yell at me like that he can\u2019t expect to eat my food and can buy his own. Even more shouting and swearing. Youngest daughter (11) tried to tell him to stop and got the brunt of it. She has OCD &amp; Aspergers so can\u2019t cope with that sort of thing and I sent her upstairs. Son threw the apple, kicked the washing basket over (talking a chip out of the coffee table) &amp; stormed downstairs.\n\nTen minutes later I heard what sounded like a door slam over &amp; over. When I went downstairs I saw the doorframe to his bedroom is split top to bottom. I told him he has to fix it.\n\nWife calmed things down &amp; later he even washed her car. She drove him to work at 6pm by which stage we still hadn\u2019t exchanged words. He\u2019d already planned to stay at a friend\u2019s so he\u2019s probably getting plastered. It\u2019s midnight now &amp; wifey is worried because \u201che\u2019s not in a good state of mind.\u201d I can\u2019t help worrying too. He\u2019s not answering her texts.\n\nI\u2019m tossing up whether to (1) programme the router to exclude all his devices; and/or (2) take his bedroom door away. However at 18 he\u2019s an adult. I don\u2019t know whether ITA, HTA or NTA. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who shut off the WiFi is in the wrong. The situation involves a father cutting off his 18-year-old son's internet access because the son wasn't doing his chores. The son reacts angrily, and there's some damage to property and the family's youngest child is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The father is dealing with a son who's in university but living at home without paying much. The son is described as being addicted to League of Legends. The father shuts off the WiFi after the son ignores his chores, and then a conflict ensues with the son yelling, throwing things, and damaging the doorframe. The father then tells the son to fix it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. On one hand, the father is trying to enforce responsibility for chores, which is a parent's role. However, the son is an adult (18 years old), so maybe the approach taken was too harsh. Cutting off WiFi might be seen as a reasonable consequence for not doing chores, but the way he did it\u2014immediately disconnecting without giving the son a chance to finish his game\u2014could have contributed to the son's frustration. The son's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the father is wrong for taking action. However, the father's actions led to a confrontation where the son was disrespectful and caused damage. Also, the father then cut off food and took away the doorframe responsibility, which might be overstepping, especially since the son is an adult. \n\nBut considering that the son is still living under his parents' roof, maybe the father has the right to set boundaries. However, the method of enforcing those boundaries (cutting WiFi abruptly) might have been the spark that led to the son's outburst. The father could have handled it differently, like discussing consequences first or setting a time limit for the game. Also, the son's reaction of yelling and causing damage is his responsibility, but the father's initial action might have been too quick. \n\nOn the other hand, the son is an adult; perhaps he should be responsible for his own internet, but since he's still living at home, it's a gray area. The father's actions could be seen as trying to teach accountability, but the way he did it might have been too harsh. The fact that the son is in a university and lives at home without contributing much financially might add to the tension. The father's motivation is to get the son to help around the house, which is valid, but the method might not have been the best approach.\n\nThe key points are: the father's intent was to enforce responsibility, but the immediate cutoff of WiFi without prior discussion might have escalated the situation. The son's reaction was inappropriate, but the father's method of enforcing consequences could be seen as contributing to the conflict. Additionally, the father's response to the son's outburst (cutting off food and making him fix the door) might be too strict, especially for an adult. \n\nConsidering all this, the father's actions might be seen as in the wrong because he could have handled the situation more calmly and with more communication. Cutting off WiFi abruptly and then cutting off food might be excessive, especially given the son's age and the potential for escalation. However, the son's behavior was clearly problematic. The father's approach might have been too harsh, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
