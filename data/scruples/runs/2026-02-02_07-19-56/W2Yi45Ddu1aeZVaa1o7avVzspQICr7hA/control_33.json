I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO while he's in prison. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together 5 years, they're engaged. The SO is in prison for drug-related issues with a 10+ year sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to talk to him anymore, and he's constantly asking for money. The SO's family is pushing the author to stay, which adds to the guilt.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about moral responsibility. In relationships, especially under such circumstances, staying together is a personal choice. The author is experiencing emotional changes and practical stress (money requests) which are valid concerns. While they initially promised support, people's feelings can evolve, especially over time and under strain.\n\nThe key points here are the change in feelings and the impact of the situation on the author. Prison can strain relationships due to distance, communication challenges, and the emotional toll. The author isn't being malicious; they're struggling with their emotions and the reality of the situation. The SO's family's pressure might also be a factor, but the author's autonomy in their decisions is important.\n\nOn the other hand, leaving someone in prison might seem harsh, but the author isn't abandoning them out of malice. They're dealing with their own emotional state. It's possible the author feels they can't sustain the relationship anymore, which is a personal realization. The guilt they feel suggests they care about the SO's well-being, but that doesn't mean they're wrong to prioritize their own needs.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision based on their changing feelings and circumstances. It's a complex situation, but the answer would be B.\n"
