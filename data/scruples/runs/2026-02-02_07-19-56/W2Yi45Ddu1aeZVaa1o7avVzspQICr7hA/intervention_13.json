I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be A Total Asshole\" question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other who's in prison. The author's situation is that they've been together for five years, got engaged, and then the SO went to prison for drug-related charges with a 10+ year sentence. Initially, the author vowed to support them, but now they're feeling distant, frustrated with constant money requests, and possibly falling out of love. They also mention the SO's family constantly reminding them of their supposed good fortune, adding to their guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. When someone is in prison, long-distance relationships are already challenging. The emotional and logistical strain can be immense. The author was committed at first but is now struggling. It's important to assess if staying in the relationship is healthy for both parties. The SO is in prison, which is a significant obstacle. The author might be feeling overwhelmed by the responsibility of maintaining the relationship, especially financially, and their feelings are changing.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Some might argue that they were there for the SO during a tough time and breaking up now is selfish or heartless. Others might say that it's natural for feelings to change over time, especially under such stress, and that the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's causing them emotional harm.\n\nThe SO's family's pressure is another factor. The author is being told daily how lucky the SO is, which could add to the guilt. But the author's well-being is also a consideration. If the relationship is no longer healthy or reciprocal, leaving might be necessary for the author's mental health.\n\nLove and commitment are complex. The author mentioned they may be falling out of love, which is a strong indicator. If the emotional connection is fading, it's possible that the relationship has changed. However, the author's initial commitment to support the SO might be seen as a promise, so not following through could be seen as breaking that promise. But if the relationship is no longer beneficial for either party, maybe ending it is the right choice.\n\nI think the key here is whether staying in the relationship is healthy. If the author is feeling resentful, stressed, and their feelings are changing, then it's not necessarily wrong to end it. The SO made choices that led to his imprisonment, which is a major life event. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that is causing them harm. However, it's important to handle the breakup with care and empathy to minimize hurt to both the SO and his family.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their feelings and well-being are valid, and relationships can change over time, especially under such circumstances. It's not selfish to prioritize one's own mental health and acknowledge that the relationship may not be sustainable.\n"
