I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be a Total Asshole\" post is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner who's in prison. \n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The couple has been together for five years. The partner is in prison for ten years due to drug involvement, which I assume was a criminal offense. The author was supportive at first, promising to stay, but now feels distant, the partner is always asking for money, and they might be falling out of love. Also, the partner's family is pushing the author to stay, making them feel guilty.\n\nSo, the author is struggling with whether ending the relationship makes them an asshole. The key points here are: commitment during hardship, the partner's current situation, and the author's emotional state.\n\nOn one hand, people might argue that staying committed through tough times is important. The author initially vowed to support their partner, so leaving now could seem like breaking that promise. Also, the partner's family views the author as a support system, so leaving might be seen as abandoning them during a critical time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's own emotional well-being is a factor. Maintaining a relationship that's causing emotional strain and financial stress (due to the money requests) might not be sustainable. Love can fade, and it's not entirely the author's fault if that happens. They might be considering their future and realizing they can't build a life around someone who's incarcerated for a long time.\n\nAnother angle is the partner's responsibility. If he's in prison for drug-related crimes, there's a choice he made that led to his incarceration. The author isn't responsible for his actions, so it's his fault, not hers. She's being honest about her feelings, which is a mature approach rather than staying in a relationship out of guilt.\n\nThe partner's family adding pressure might be complicating things. They might not realize the toll it's taking on the author. It's important that the author is considering her own needs here, not just others' expectations.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's made a promise but circumstances have changed, it's not necessarily her fault. People can change their feelings, and it's not fair to expect someone to stay in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling. The partner's actions led to his current situation, so the blame isn't hers. She's being honest and considering her own well-being, which is responsible. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
