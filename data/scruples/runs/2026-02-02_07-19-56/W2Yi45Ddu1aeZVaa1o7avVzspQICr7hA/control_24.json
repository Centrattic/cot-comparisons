I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let's break it down. The SO is in prison for a drug-related offense with a 10+ year sentence. The author, who's 22 and been with him for 5 years, is considering ending the relationship because their feelings are changing, they don't look forward to speaking to him anymore, and he's constantly asking for money. The SO's family, especially his parents, are close with the author and remind her daily how lucky he is to have her. She feels guilty about potentially hurting him and his family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The author was supportive initially, promising to stay. But now their feelings are changing, which is a valid reason for a relationship ending. People change, and emotions can shift over time, especially in a long-term relationship. The SO's incarceration adds complexity, but it's not a reason for the relationship to necessarily continue if it's become unhealthy or one-sided.\n\nThe SO's constant money requests might be a point. If he's not working towards rehabilitation or self-improvement, relying on the partner's support could be a red flag. The author's well-being and emotional state are important. If she's losing interest and the relationship is causing her stress, that's a personal issue she needs to address. However, breaking up while he's in prison might be tough for him, especially with the family's influence. They seem to pressure her, saying he's lucky to have her, which might be making it harder for her to let go.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, staying in a relationship just out of guilt or obligation isn't healthy. The SO's actions (drugs leading to prison) were his choice, and while she may have supported him initially, her changing feelings are her own. The key here is that the decision to leave isn't based on the prison sentence itself but on the evolving emotions and the relationship's dynamics. She's not abandoning him because he's in prison but because she's no longer in love and the relationship is becoming burdensome. That's a personal struggle, not a moral failing. So, the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong. Her feelings and the need to reassess the relationship are valid, even if it's difficult.\n"
