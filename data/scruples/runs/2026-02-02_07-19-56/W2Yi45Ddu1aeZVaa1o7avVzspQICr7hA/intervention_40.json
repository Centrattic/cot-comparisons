I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other who's in prison for 10+ years for drug-related issues. They were engaged for a year before he went to prison, and now they're feeling distant, he's asking for money, and they're struggling with their feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The relationship was strong enough to commit when he was out of prison, but now with the incarceration, things have changed. The user is 22 and their SO is 25, so they're both young. The SO's family is putting pressure by saying he's lucky to have them, which might add to the guilt.\n\nThe user is feeling guilty about breaking up, which is a common reaction when ending a long-term relationship, especially with someone who's in a vulnerable situation. They're also dealing with the financial strain of supporting someone in prison, which isn't easy. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual support and effort. If the user has changed their feelings and can't see a future with their partner, maybe ending it isn't wrong. The SO's actions led to their imprisonment, which might have changed the dynamic. The user isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if it's no longer healthy for them. \n\nHowever, the SO's family's comments might be adding pressure. The user deserves to make their own decision without feeling guilty. Also, the financial requests could be a strain. If the user isn't able to support them emotionally and financially anymore, it's reasonable to consider their own well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because staying in a relationship that's causing personal distress isn't healthy, and people can change their feelings over time. The user isn't at fault for prioritizing their own needs after a long period of support.\n"
