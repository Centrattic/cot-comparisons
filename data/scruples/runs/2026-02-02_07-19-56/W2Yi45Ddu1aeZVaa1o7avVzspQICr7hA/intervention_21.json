I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're engaged to their SO, who's in prison for drug-related charges. They've been together for five years, and the author initially promised to support their partner. Now, after some time, the author is feeling like they can't handle it anymore\u2014don't look forward to talking to their SO, he's constantly asking for money, and they're falling out of love. They're also close with his family, who keep reminding them how lucky he is to have them. The author feels guilty about breaking up and is asking if they'd be an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The author made a commitment to stay with their partner, especially after being engaged. But commitment can be tested under extreme circumstances. Prison can be a very isolating and difficult situation for both the incarcerated person and their partner. The author is 22 and their partner is 25, so they're both young. The SO has a long sentence, which might make the future uncertain. The author is struggling with their feelings and the constant financial strain of supporting someone in prison, which can be expensive with visits, calls, sending money, etc.\n\nThe SO's family is adding pressure by making the author feel like they're the only one supporting him, which might be guilt-tripping them. The author is conflicted between their own emotional well-being and their promise. It's possible that staying in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling could be harmful to the author's mental health. On the other hand, breaking up might cause emotional pain to the SO and his family, especially given the circumstances.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to leave? Well, relationships require mutual effort. If the partner in prison is not contributing emotionally or there's a lack of reciprocity, the author might feel they're shouldering too much. But the author initially committed to support him, so breaking that could be seen as a betrayal. However, people have limits, and if the relationship is causing more harm than good, it's not necessarily wrong to reevaluate.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's well-being, the nature of the original commitment, and the current state of the relationship. If the author is falling out of love and can't see a future, it's a valid reason to end things. The guilt comes from feeling they should stick it out despite everything. But in reality, people's feelings can change, especially under such stress. So whether they're in the wrong depends on whether they acted out of selfishness or genuine emotional exhaustion and a lack of mutual support.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with real emotional and financial stress. It's not about being cruel but about recognizing that the relationship isn't sustainable. So the answer would be B.\n"
