I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO who's in prison. The SO got a 10+ year sentence for drug involvement, and the author has been supporting him but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to talk as much, and are being asked for money constantly. The family is pressuring them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author initially committed to supporting their SO, but circumstances have changed. The SO is in prison, which is a tough situation. The author isn't doing anything illegal by leaving; they're just ending a relationship. But there's guilt involved because of the commitment they made before the SO went to prison.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their own happiness and shouldn't be forced to stay in a relationship they're no longer comfortable with. On the other hand, breaking up when the partner is vulnerable could be seen as harsh. But the SO is in prison, which complicates things. The author isn't abandoning them physically, but emotionally and financially. The SO is asking for money, which adds stress. The author's feelings have changed, so maybe it's natural to end it.\n\nThe key points here are commitment, changed circumstances, and mutual respect. When people commit to a relationship, especially marriage, they usually expect to stay together through tough times. But if the relationship is no longer fulfilling, can they leave? It's a tough call. However, since the SO is in prison for a long time, maintaining a relationship remotely is challenging. The author might feel that the relationship isn't sustainable in the long run.\n\nAlso, the family's pressure might be contributing to the author's stress. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being over staying. Since the author isn't doing anything malicious and is being honest, I think they're not in the wrong. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person is no longer able to give that, ending it is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
