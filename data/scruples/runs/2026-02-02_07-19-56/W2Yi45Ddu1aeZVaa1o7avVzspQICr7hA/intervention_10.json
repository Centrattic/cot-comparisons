I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person writing this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is in a five-year relationship with their significant other (SO), who is now in prison for drug-related charges. They got engaged around the time he went to prison, which was a 10+ year sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now they're feeling different. They mention not looking forward to speaking to him, him asking for money a lot, and possibly falling out of love. The family is close, and the parents are always highlighting how lucky he is to have the author. The author feels guilty about breaking up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they leave their SO while he's in prison. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects here. Committing to a relationship, especially one with marriage plans, implies a certain level of commitment. However, staying in a relationship that's causing emotional distress or is no longer fulfilling might be a personal decision. The SO is in prison, which adds a layer of complexity because communication is harder, and the author might feel isolated or overwhelmed.\n\nThe author's initial commitment was to support the SO through this, but circumstances have changed. The SO is asking for money, which could be a financial burden. The author's feelings of love fading are also a personal factor. However, breaking up after a long-term commitment might seem like a betrayal, especially given the engagement and the fact that the SO can't defend himself or respond to the situation directly. The author's family is involved, and the parents are using the situation to highlight the author's supposed loyalty, which might be adding pressure.\n\nBut on the other hand, people's feelings can change, and it's possible the author is no longer able to maintain the emotional connection. The SO's actions (drug involvement) led to his imprisonment, which might have already strained the relationship. The author's well-being is also a factor here\u2014if staying in the relationship is causing them distress, maybe they're justified in leaving.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of loyalty and commitment. The author promised to be there, and breaking up might be seen as a betrayal, especially in the eyes of the family and possibly the SO himself. But relationships require mutual effort, and if the SO is not providing emotional support or is a burden, the author might have a right to their decision.\n\nI need to balance these factors. The key points are the initial commitment, the change in circumstances, the SO's situation in prison, and the author's emotional state. There's no clear right or wrong here, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting out of self-preservation and the relationship has genuinely deteriorated, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they broke their promise without a valid reason, then they might be. However, the situation is complex, and personal feelings are valid. So perhaps the answer is that they're not in the wrong because relationships require mutual effort and circumstances can change, making it impossible to maintain the relationship as before.\n"
