I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years. The author is 22, the SO is 25. They got engaged last year, but then the SO was sent to prison for drug-related issues, getting a 10+ year sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him. Now, the author is feeling distant, the SO is constantly asking for money, and the author is close to his family who keep reminding her how lucky he is to have her. She's feeling guilty about breaking up with him.\n\nThe key points here are the initial commitment, the emotional and financial strain, and the guilt from family. The question is whether she's in the wrong for considering leaving.\n\nI think about relationships and commitments. When someone is in prison, it's a huge challenge. The author made a commitment, but circumstances change. People can change their feelings over time. The SO's situation is out of his control, but the author's feelings are real. She's struggling with her emotions and the pressure from his family.\n\nIn terms of morality, staying in a relationship out of obligation versus genuine feelings can be unhealthy. If she's no longer in love and is resentful, staying might not be fair to either of them. But breaking up while he's in prison could be seen as abandoning him, which might be harsh. However, her well-being is also important. Relationships should be mutual support, and if one person is constantly asking for money and the other is losing interest, it's a valid reason to reconsider.\n\nThe family's pressure adds to her guilt, but that shouldn't override her personal feelings and needs. It's possible she's not in the wrong because she's acting on her true feelings rather than societal expectations. People have the right to their own happiness, even if it's difficult.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). She's facing a tough situation, and her feelings are valid. The commitment she made was under different circumstances. Change in feelings doesn't make her an asshole; it's a natural part of human relationships.\n"
