I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong if they leave their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 5 years, got engaged, and then the SO was sentenced to 10+ years for drug-related issues. The author initially committed to supporting him. Now, they're feeling less connected, the SO asks for money, and the author is considering breaking up. They feel guilty, and the SO's parents are pressuring them. The question is whether the author is an asshole for breaking up.\n\nHmm. So, relationships are complex. When a major life event happens, like going to prison, it can strain a relationship. The author is young, 22 and 25. They might not have considered the long-term implications of a prison sentence. The SO's lack of a good lawyer leading to a harsh sentence might be a point of sympathy, but maybe the author feels they can't handle the emotional and financial stress anymore.\n\nOn one hand, the author was supportive at first, which is commendable. Staying with someone in prison is tough. But now, they're struggling with the ongoing demands and emotional distance. The SO's parents' comments might add pressure. The author's feelings of guilt are valid, but they also have their own needs and evolving emotions.\n\nIs it fair to say they're in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual effort. If the SO is constantly asking for money without any reciprocal support, maybe it's unbalanced. Also, the author's changing feelings are natural over time. While staying might have been expected initially, people can't be expected to sustain a relationship if they're no longer emotionally invested.\n\nBut then again, the SO is in a vulnerable position. Breaking up might be painful, but the author has a right to their own happiness. The key here is whether the author is being selfish or realistic. If they're genuinely falling out of love and the relationship is causing them distress, it's not necessarily wrong to end it, even if it's difficult. However, the SO might feel betrayed if they expected lifelong commitment. But the author can't force themselves to stay if they're unhappy. \n\nI think the answer isn't black and white. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're making this decision based on their own needs and not out of spite, maybe they're not in the wrong. The fact that they're feeling guilty suggests they care, but they also deserve to be in a relationship where they can be happy.\n"
