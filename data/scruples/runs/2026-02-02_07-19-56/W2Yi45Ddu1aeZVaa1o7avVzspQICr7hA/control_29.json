      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years, and they got engaged. The man was sentenced to over 10 years in prison for drug-related issues, partly because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author, a 22-year-old, initially vowed to support him. Now, two years later, they're experiencing changes: the author is losing interest, the SO constantly asks for money, and the author feels pressure from the in-laws. The author is conflicted about breaking up because it would hurt the SO and his family, but also feels guilty.\n\nThe key points here are the initial commitment to support him, the current emotional and financial strain, and the potential impact of breaking up. The author's commitment was made under the assumption that they'd stay together, but circumstances have changed. The SO's ongoing requests for money might be causing stress, and the author's feelings are shifting. The in-laws emphasizing how lucky the SO is might add to the pressure, making the author feel obligated.\n\nBut relationships require mutual effort and support. If the author is no longer emotionally invested and the relationship is causing them stress, is it wrong to end it? On one hand, leaving someone in prison could be seen as abandonment, especially since they were engaged. On the other hand, the author is still young and might need time for their own growth. The SO's actions leading to prison time (drug involvement) might be a red flag that the author is now realizing they can't continue with.\n\nAlso, considering the SO's financial dependency, the author might be in a position where they can't realistically support him long-term without losing their own well-being. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, people can change their feelings, and it's not necessarily wrong to end a relationship if it's no longer healthy. However, the initial promise to support him could weigh on this decision.\n\nBut promises are made in the moment, and circumstances change. The author isn't breaking up immediately after the sentencing but after a few years, during which the relationship dynamics have shifted. The SO's behavior (asking for money constantly) might be contributing to the author's decision. The in-laws' comments could also be influencing the author's perception of their role.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some might see leaving as selfish, but others might argue that the author has the right to pursue their own happiness. The author's guilt suggests they're conflicted, which is normal in such a situation. The answer hinges on whether the author is being fair to themselves and recognizing that their feelings have changed, versus being unfair to the SO and his family.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a difficult decision based on changing circumstances and their own emotional needs. The SO's actions and the subsequent strain might justify ending the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
