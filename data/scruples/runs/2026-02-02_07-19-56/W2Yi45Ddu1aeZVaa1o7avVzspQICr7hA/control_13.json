I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be A Total Asshole\" question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other who's in prison for drug-related charges. The author mentions being with their SO for five years, getting engaged, then the SO going to prison with a 10+ year sentence. They initially committed to supporting them but now feel they're losing interest, there's financial strain from sending money, and guilt from the SO's family's support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Love and relationships are complex. The author promised support when the situation arose, which is commendable, but now they're experiencing a shift in feelings. It's important to recognize that people can change their feelings over time, especially in challenging circumstances. Prison can strain relationships due to the difficulty of maintaining contact, the stress of the situation, and the emotional toll on both parties.\n\nFinancial pressure is another factor. The SO is asking for money, which might be causing stress for the author. If the author is struggling to provide that support, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. However, it's also worth considering if the SO is in a position where they can't work or earn money themselves, and if the author is being asked for something beyond their means.\n\nThe SO's family is pushing the author to stay, which might add to the pressure. The author's guilt could be from feeling they're letting down the SO and his parents, but ultimately, the author has a right to their own happiness and well-being. Staying in a relationship out of obligation or guilt might not be healthy for either person.\n\nIt's also important to note that relationships require mutual effort. If the SO is not making an effort to maintain the relationship or address the issues causing strain, that's a red flag. However, the author might not have communicated their feelings yet, so there's a chance that discussing things could resolve some issues.\n\nIn terms of morality, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. Staying in a relationship that's becoming unhealthy or unfulfilling isn't a betrayal if the relationship is no longer working. Love can fade, and that's a natural part of human experience. However, the decision to leave should be made with compassion and consideration for the other person's feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because people's feelings can change, and it's reasonable to reassess a relationship under such circumstances. The key factors are the author's genuine feelings and the mutual respect in ending the relationship if that's the right choice.\n"
