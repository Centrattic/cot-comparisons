I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner who's in prison. The situation is that they've been together five years, got engaged, but then the partner went to prison for drug-related issues. The person writing has been supporting them, but now they're feeling strained, the partner keeps asking for money, and they're losing feelings. They're also getting pressure from the partner's family. The question is if they'd be an asshole for breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The partner is in prison for 10+ years, which is a long time. The writer is still young, 22 and 25. They made a commitment to stay, but circumstances have changed. The key points are the ongoing financial strain, emotional distance, and the family's expectations.\n\nIn relationships, especially when there's a long-term commitment like engagement, staying together is expected, but circumstances can change. The writer might be feeling trapped if the relationship is no longer fulfilling. However, the partner is in a vulnerable position, and leaving could add emotional trauma. The family's constant reminders might add pressure on the writer.\n\nBut the writer also has their own emotional well-being and future to consider. If the relationship has deteriorated to the point where they're not in love anymore and the communication is stressful (like constant money requests), it's a valid reason to reevaluate. It's not necessarily about being right or wrong, but about whether the decision is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then they are wrong. If B, not wrong. The key is whether their reasons are justified. Since they're experiencing emotional changes and stress, and considering the long sentence, it's a personal decision. The partner is in prison, so the dynamic is different. The writer isn't abandoning them immediately; it's a choice made over time as the relationship changes.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B, that they're not in the wrong. People can't be expected to stay in a relationship that's causing them harm, even if the partner is in prison. The writer's feelings and mental health matter too. However, they should handle the breakup with care to minimize hurt, but that doesn't make them an asshole.\n"
