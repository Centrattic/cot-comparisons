I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO while he's in prison. The SO has a 10+ year sentence, they've been together 5 years, and the writer is 22. They're struggling with supporting him, financial requests, and feeling like the love is fading.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The writer initially committed to supporting their partner, which is commendable, but relationships can change over time. The SO is in prison, which adds a layer of difficulty. Long-distance relationships are tough, but this is even more extreme with the prison aspect. Financial strain is a big issue here\u2014supporting someone in prison can be costly, and if the SO is constantly asking for money, that could be a burden. The writer feels guilty, which shows they care about their partner's feelings and his family's opinions.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the writer is wrong to end the relationship. Relationships are based on mutual respect and support. If one person is no longer able to support the other in a healthy way, maybe ending it is necessary. The writer might feel they're losing their love and not looking forward to communication. That's a sign that the relationship might not be sustainable. The SO's family's comments add pressure, but the writer's well-being is also important. \n\nBut then, the initial commitment to support him was a promise. Breaking that could cause emotional pain to the SO and his family. However, staying in a relationship that's becoming toxic or unfulfilling isn't healthy either. The writer might be prioritizing their own emotional health, which is valid. \n\nI need to weigh the commitment against the current reality. The writer isn't being selfish if they're genuinely feeling like the relationship isn't working anymore. It's possible to be wrong if they're breaking a promise without trying to resolve the issues, but given the circumstances\u2014long-term commitment, financial strain, changing feelings\u2014it's more of a complex situation where the writer isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with real issues affecting their relationship and their well-being.\n"
