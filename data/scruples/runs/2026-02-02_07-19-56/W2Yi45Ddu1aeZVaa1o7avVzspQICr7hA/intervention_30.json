I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their fianc\u00e9 while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been together for 5 years. The fianc\u00e9 got a 10+ year sentence due to drug involvement and a poor lawyer. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now they're feeling distant, he's asking for money, and they're considering breaking up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what others think. They want me to answer A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nHmm. Relationships require mutual effort. When someone is in prison, the dynamics change a lot. The author initially promised to support him, which is commendable. But now, after time, their feelings have changed. They mention not looking forward to speaking to him anymore and falling out of love. That's a significant change. The fianc\u00e9 is in prison, which is a challenging situation for both parties.\n\nOn one hand, staying in a relationship that's losing its emotional connection can be difficult. The author might be feeling overwhelmed by the financial strain from supporting him and the emotional toll of the long-distance relationship. On the other hand, breaking up could be hurtful, especially when the fianc\u00e9 is already in prison, and the author had previously committed to being there.\n\nBut love and feelings are complex. If the author is no longer in love, is it fair to stay just out of obligation? Relationships shouldn't be maintained solely out of guilt or past promises if the emotional bond is gone. The key here is whether the author is acting out of genuine care or just past commitments.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's family is also pressuring the author, which adds pressure. But the author's well-being is important too. They might be feeling guilty, but if they're not happy, ending the relationship could be healthier in the long run. However, the timing and the way they break up would matter. It's important to handle it with compassion to minimize hurt.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship if they genuinely can't continue. Love and relationships require mutual feelings. If the author's feelings have changed, it's their right to make a decision that's best for them, even if it's painful for others. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
