I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, got engaged, and then the SO went to prison for drug-related charges with a 10+ year sentence. The writer initially committed to supporting him, but now they're feeling distant, stressed by financial requests, and possibly falling out of love. They're also dealing with the SO's family's constant praise, which adds pressure. The main question is whether ending the relationship makes the author an asshole.\n\nNow, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author was supportive initially and made a commitment. Breaking that could hurt the SO and his family. But on the other hand, maintaining a relationship that's becoming emotionally draining and possibly loveless might not be healthy for the author either. \n\nFactors to consider include the nature of their commitment. When someone is in prison, the relationship is already under immense strain. The author is young (22) and might be going through personal growth and change. The SO's requests for money could be a source of stress, especially if the author can't afford it. Also, falling out of love is a legitimate reason to end a relationship, even if the partner is in prison. \n\nThe family's influence is also a factor. The parents' comments might be making the author feel guilty, but their support might not reflect the author's actual feelings or the relationship's reality. \n\nEthically, relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection. If the author is no longer able to provide emotional support and is feeling resentful, continuing the relationship might not be fair to either party. However, the author should consider the impact on the SO, who is already in a difficult situation. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, staying in a relationship without love or support can be harmful too. The author is being honest about their feelings, which is important. The SO might need the support, but the author's well-being is also important. There's no clear right or wrong here, but considering the emotional aspects, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and future. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the relationship is based on mutual needs, and if those needs are no longer met, ending it isn't necessarily wrong despite the circumstances.\n"
