I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been together for five years. The SO is in prison for 10+ years due to drug-related issues. The author promised support but now feels the relationship is changing. They're struggling with guilt because the SO's parents are supportive and the SO is asking for money. The author is questioning if ending the relationship would make them an asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here are the promises made, the current emotional state of the author, and the ethical considerations. The author initially committed to staying, which shows dedication. However, relationships can evolve, and people's feelings can change over time. The author's feelings of guilt and the pressure from the SO's family might be complicating things.\n\nI need to consider the ethical angle. Committing to support someone in hard times is a significant promise, but it's also important to recognize when a relationship becomes unsustainable or harmful. The author mentions not looking forward to communication anymore and falling out of love, which are valid personal feelings. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person is no longer emotionally invested, it might not be healthy to continue.\n\nOn the other hand, the SO is in prison, dealing with the consequences of their actions. The author's support might be crucial for their well-being. Breaking up could have emotional repercussions for the SO and their family. However, the author's well-being is also important. They might feel trapped by their initial commitment, leading to resentment or emotional distress.\n\nAnother angle is the SO's behavior\u2014constantly asking for money. This could be a strain on the author, contributing to their changing feelings. The author might feel exploited or overwhelmed, which could justify stepping back. But since the SO is in prison, their ability to work and support themselves is limited, so their requests might stem from genuine need.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that people have the right to change their feelings and that staying in a relationship without love or mutual effort can be harmful, then B (not in the wrong) might be the answer. However, if breaking the promise is seen as a betrayal, then A (in the wrong) could be the case.\n\nBut it's also important to note that the author isn't necessarily being selfish. They're grappling with their own emotions and the reality of the situation. The guilt they feel suggests they're trying to balance their conscience with their current feelings. So, while they might feel guilty, it's not necessarily wrong to prioritize their own well-being when the relationship is no longer fulfilling.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to leave isn't inherently wrong because relationships are complex, and people's feelings can change. The key is that they're making a difficult choice based on their current circumstances and emotional state, not out of selfishness but out of necessity for their own happiness and well-being.\n"
