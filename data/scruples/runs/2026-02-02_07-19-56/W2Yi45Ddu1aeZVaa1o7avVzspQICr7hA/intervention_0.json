I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together 5 years, got engaged, then he went to prison for drugs. She initially committed to supporting him, but now she's having doubts. She's not looking forward to talking to him anymore, he's asking for money, and she's falling out of love. His family is pressuring her, and she feels guilty. The question is whether she's in the wrong if she breaks up.\n\nHmm. Well, relationships are complex, especially when there's a prison sentence involved. When you commit to someone, especially through an engagement, there's an expectation of staying together through tough times. But people's feelings can change. She might be struggling with the emotional and financial burden. His family's constant reminders about how lucky he is to have her could be adding pressure. \n\nBut on the other hand, staying in a relationship that's become unsupportive or where love is fading might not be healthy for either person. However, breaking up while he's in prison could be hurtful, given the circumstances. The initial promise to support him might weigh against her decision. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Maybe it's not black and white. People have the right to their feelings, but there's also the aspect of commitment. If she's no longer in love and the relationship isn't fulfilling, maybe it's not wrong to leave. But considering the circumstances of his imprisonment and her initial commitment, some might see leaving as a breach of trust. \n\nI think the key points are: her initial commitment vs. her current feelings, the impact on him and his family, and whether she's considering all options (like setting boundaries instead of breaking up). But since the question is if she's in the wrong, it's subjective. Some might say she's in the wrong for not sticking to her promise, others might say it's okay because people's feelings change and she can't be forced to stay. \n\nI'm torn. But maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because relationships require mutual effort, and if love is fading and he's not there, it's hard to sustain. However, the initial promise complicates things. But maybe it's not her fault if feelings change. So leaning towards B.\n"
