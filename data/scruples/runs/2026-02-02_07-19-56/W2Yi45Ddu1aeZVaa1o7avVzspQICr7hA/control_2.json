I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. The SO got a 10+ year sentence for drug-related issues, and the writer is now 22, they've been together five years, engaged. The writer supported him initially but is now finding it hard, wanting to end things because they're not looking forward to talking to him, he asks for money all the time, and they're falling out of love. Also, the SO's parents are pushing the writer to stay, which is causing guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key factors here are the circumstances of the relationship, the prison sentence, financial strain, emotional changes, and the pressure from the in-laws. \n\nPrison sentences can put a huge strain on relationships. The author was supportive at first, which is commendable, but over time, the emotional and financial toll might be taking its toll. The SO's constant requests for money could be a burden, especially if the author is young and possibly has limited financial resources. Falling out of love is also a valid reason for ending a relationship. While the author feels guilty, staying in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling might not be healthy for either party. The pressure from the SO's parents adds to the guilt, but their opinions shouldn't override the author's own feelings and needs.\n\nHowever, some might argue that breaking up while someone is in prison is harsh, given the unique challenges they face. But the author isn't in the wrong if they're no longer in love and can't support the relationship. Love and mutual support are fundamental in a relationship. If those elements are fading, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The key here is whether the author's decision is based on genuine feelings and circumstances rather than convenience or selfishness. Since the author has been supportive but is now struggling, it's a tough situation, but their feelings are valid. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
