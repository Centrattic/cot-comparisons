I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a partner deciding to leave their significant other while he's in prison for drug-related charges. The SO got a 10+ year sentence due to not being able to afford a good lawyer. The author has been supporting him but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to speak to him anymore, and are being pressured by in-laws.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author initially committed to staying with their partner during tough times. But now, they're struggling with their feelings and the emotional strain. The key points here are commitment, current feelings, and the impact of the decision.\n\nOn one hand, breaking a promise made during a crisis might seem like a betrayal, especially when the partner is in prison. The author's in-laws are adding pressure, which complicates things. On the other hand, people's feelings can change over time. If the author is genuinely no longer in love and the relationship is causing them emotional distress, they might not be in the wrong for ending it. It's also important to consider the reality of long-term commitment in such a difficult situation. Supporting someone in prison for a decade is a huge commitment, and if the love is fading, it's reasonable for the author to reassess.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that people can't be forced to stay in a relationship if their feelings change, then the answer would be B (not wrong). However, if the author's decision is seen as breaking a promise without valid reasons, then A (wrong). But given that the author is experiencing a shift in feelings and the relationship is causing them pain, it's more compassionate to say they're not in the wrong. They're making a tough choice based on their current emotional state and future well-being.\n"
