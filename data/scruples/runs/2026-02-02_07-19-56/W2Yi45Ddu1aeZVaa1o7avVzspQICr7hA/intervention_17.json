I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) who is in prison for 10+ years due to drug involvement. The author has been with their SO for five years, got engaged, but then the SO went to prison. The author initially promised to support them, but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to talk as much, and the SO is asking for money. Also, the SO's parents are constantly reminding the author of how lucky the SO is to have them.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from different angles. Relationships are complex, especially when one person is in prison. The author might be feeling guilt and pressure from the SO's family, which could be influencing their decision. They might also be dealing with their own emotional changes, like losing interest or love. On the other hand, the SO is in a tough situation, and the author had committed to supporting them. Breaking up could be seen as abandoning the SO, which might be hurtful.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, people change, and it's possible they genuinely can't maintain the relationship anymore. The SO's constant requests for money might be a strain, and the distance of prison can make relationships unsustainable. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling. However, considering the SO's situation and the initial commitment, some might argue that leaving could be seen as not honoring that commitment. But others might say that staying in a broken relationship isn't healthy for either person.\n\nThe key points here are the change in feelings, the impact of long-distance and prison dynamics, and the pressure from the SO's family. The author's feelings of guilt are valid, but they also have their own emotional well-being to consider. It's important to remember that relationships require mutual effort, and if one person is no longer able or willing to put in the effort, it's not necessarily wrong to end it, even if it's hard.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, there's no clear right or wrong here. The author might feel they're being selfish, but they're also human and allowed to reassess their feelings. The SO's family might judge the author harshly, but that's their family's response, not the author's fault. The author's decision to leave doesn't make them an asshole if they genuinely tried to support the SO and are now realizing it's no longer sustainable.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They have a right to their own feelings and well-being, and the situation has changed from when they made the commitment. It's a difficult choice, but it's their prerogative.\n"
