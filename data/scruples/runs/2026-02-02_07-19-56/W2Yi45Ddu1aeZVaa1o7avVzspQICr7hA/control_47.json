I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner who's in prison. The author is 22, their SO is 25, they've been together five years, got engaged, and then the SO went to prison for drug-related issues. The author supported them initially but now feels they're falling out of love, the SO keeps asking for money, and they're close to the in-laws who pressure them. They feel guilty about breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The SO is in a 10+ year prison sentence, which is a huge life change. The author had promised support initially but now is struggling. The key points are: emotional support, financial strain from the SO asking for money, loss of love, and the pressure from the partner's family. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual effort. If the author is no longer in love and the relationship is causing them stress, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the SO can't afford a good lawyer, which might indicate financial issues. However, the author is giving money now, and maybe that's a strain. The guilt comes from the promise and family expectations. \n\nIn such situations, it's a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if they're unhappy. But maybe they could have handled it more sensitively, like giving more notice or support. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since staying in a loveless relationship could be harmful for both, breaking up might be the right choice. So the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
