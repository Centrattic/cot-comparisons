He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person is wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison for a drug-related offense. The SO has a 10+ year sentence, and the author is 22, their SO is 25. They were engaged when he was sent to prison, and the author initially committed to supporting him. Now, they're feeling the relationship is changing\u2014no longer looking forward to conversations, he's always asking for money, and they might be falling out of love. The SO's parents are close with the author and often mention how lucky he is to have her, which adds to the guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. The SO is in prison, which is a significant stressor. The author is still young (22) and has been in the relationship for five years. They made a promise to support him, but circumstances have changed. The question is whether breaking off the engagement now is wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, relationships require mutual effort and support. If the SO is in a position where he's not contributing to the relationship and is constantly asking for money, that could be a valid reason for the author to reevaluate. But the author also feels guilty, especially because the SO's family is involved and likely relying on the author's support. However, the author's well-being and personal growth are also important. They might not have enough support to maintain the relationship, and staying in a relationship that's causing emotional strain could be harmful to both parties in the long run.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of love and commitment. The author mentioned they might be falling out of love, which is a personal feeling and hard to judge externally. The initial commitment to support the SO was made, but over time, feelings can change. It's not necessarily inconsiderate to leave if the relationship is no longer fulfilling or if the author is losing their emotional connection.\n\nThe aspect of the SO's inability to afford a good lawyer is a past event, and the current situation is about the ongoing relationship. The author is not responsible for his legal issues, but the ongoing requests for money could be a point of contention. If the author is being financially strained or feels exploited, that's a valid concern.\n\nHowever, breaking up might hurt the SO and his family. The author's parents are close with the author and might be disappointed. But the author is under no obligation to continue the relationship if it's no longer viable. It's important to be honest and respectful in the process, even if it's painful.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often view breaking up with someone in prison as harsh, but it's a personal decision. The author isn't abandoning them entirely; they might still visit or stay in touch. The key is whether the author is being fair and not using the prison situation to avoid their own responsibilities in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are dealing with the reality of the relationship over time and their own feelings. It's a tough decision, but it's their right to prioritize their own emotional well-being and future. The answer would be B: No.\n"
