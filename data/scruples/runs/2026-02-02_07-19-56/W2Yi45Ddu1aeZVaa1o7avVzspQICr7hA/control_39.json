I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO who's in prison for a drug-related offense. The SO got a 10+ year sentence because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author has been supportive for 5 years but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to keep supporting financially, and are worried about how the breakup will affect the SO and his family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The SO made a bad choice with drugs, leading to a long prison sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him, which is commendable. But now, their feelings are changing. It's natural for people's emotions to evolve, especially under prolonged stress and distance. The author might feel isolated or overwhelmed by the financial burden and lack of emotional connection now.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to end the relationship. On one hand, they made a promise to stay, but relationships require mutual effort. If the SO's actions have led to a situation where the author can't maintain the relationship, maybe it's not entirely their fault. Also, staying in a relationship without love could be harmful in the long run for both parties. However, the author might feel guilty because they initially vowed to support him, and the SO's family adds to that pressure.\n\nBut the key points here are the author's changed feelings, the financial strain, and the lack of progress in the relationship. It's a tough situation, and while it's hurtful to the SO and his family, the author has a right to their own happiness. They aren't obligated to stay in a relationship that no longer feels right to them. So, the answer would be B (they're not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where their decision is understandable despite the potential hurt caused.\n"
