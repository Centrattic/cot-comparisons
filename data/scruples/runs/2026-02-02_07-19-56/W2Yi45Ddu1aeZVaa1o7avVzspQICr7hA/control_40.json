I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together for five years. The SO was sentenced to 10+ years for drug-related issues. The writer, who is 22, initially wanted to support their partner but now feels they're falling out of love, are tired of being asked for money constantly, and are struggling with guilt. The SO's family is pressuring the writer, making them feel like they should stay. The question is whether leaving would make the writer an \"asshole.\"\n\nNow, considering ethical and moral perspectives. Relationships are based on mutual respect and support. When someone is incarcerated, maintaining a relationship can be challenging. The writer initially promised support, but circumstances have changed. They mention feeling like they're losing love and the constant financial strain. It's important to recognize that while staying might be noble, the writer's well-being and personal growth are also valid. \n\nOn one hand, breaking up might seem harsh because the SO is vulnerable. But on the other hand, staying in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling could be harmful to both parties. The writer might feel trapped, and the SO might not get the chance to grow if the relationship is forced. The guilt is understandable, but the writer isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's deteriorating.\n\nAlso, considering the SO's family's role in adding pressure might be another layer. They might be using guilt to keep the writer involved, which isn't healthy. The writer should prioritize their own mental health and realistic future with someone who can provide a supportive, balanced relationship.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while staying might be seen as supportive, it's also okay to reassess when the relationship isn't meeting the writer's needs anymore. People have the right to change their feelings and circumstances. The key is that the writer is being honest about their feelings and not staying just out of obligation. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to leave, even though it's a tough decision. They're not obligated to stay in an unhappy relationship, especially under these challenging conditions.\n"
