I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that someone is considering leaving their significant other who's in prison for drug-related charges. They've been together for five years, got engaged, and now the SO is serving a 10+ year sentence. The person writing the question is feeling guilty about ending the relationship because of the emotional strain, financial requests from the SO, and the support from the SO's family. They're wondering if they're an asshole for breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is 22, the SO is 25. They were engaged, but the SO went to prison. The author initially vowed to support them but now feels the relationship is changing. They're struggling with guilt, especially since the in-laws are pushing the idea that the author is being supportive. The SO is asking for money constantly, and the author is losing feelings.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine if the author is wrong to end the relationship.\n\nRelationships require mutual effort and support. When one person is in prison, it's a huge challenge. The author committed to supporting their SO, but over time, things changed. The SO is asking for money, which might be a burden. The author is also losing feelings, which is a valid emotional issue. The SO's family's constant reminders about the author's support could add pressure, but the author's feelings are real.\n\nIs the author wrong for ending things? Well, relationships should be based on mutual respect and support. If the author feels they can't continue, maybe it's their right to end it. However, the initial promise to support the SO might conflict with that. Also, the SO is in a vulnerable position, so leaving could be seen as abandoning them. But on the other hand, the author's well-being and feelings matter too.\n\nThe key here is whether the author has a valid reason to leave. The SO's constant money requests and the author's loss of love could be legitimate reasons. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's causing them emotional and financial strain. However, the commitment made before the imprisonment might make the author feel they should stay. But people's feelings can change, especially over a long prison sentence.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're choosing their own happiness and well-being over a relationship that's no longer fulfilling, maybe not. They're not obligated to stay if the relationship is one-sided or causing harm. The SO's family's expectations shouldn't override the author's personal feelings and needs. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
