I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO who's in prison. The situation is that they've been together 5 years, got engaged, but then the SO went to prison for drug-related issues. The author promised support but now feels they're falling out of love, the SO constantly asks for money, and the in-laws are pressuring them. They're feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the SO's behavior (asking for money repeatedly), the author's changing feelings, and the emotional impact on both sides. \n\nIn a relationship, mutual support is important, but it's also a two-way street. If one person is consistently taking without giving back, that can strain the relationship. The author mentions they're not looking forward to speaking anymore and are falling out of love. That's a significant emotional shift. \n\nAlso, the SO's family is putting pressure on the author, which might be adding to the stress. The author is conflicted because ending the relationship would hurt the SO and his parents. However, staying in a relationship where one is unhappy and unreciprocated could be harmful too. \n\nSociety often praises staying loyal in tough times, but personal well-being is also crucial. The author isn't necessarily being selfish if the relationship is no longer fulfilling. They might need to prioritize their own mental health. \n\nBut, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the author is breaking a promise, but the circumstances have changed (like the relationship dynamics and their own feelings), it's a complex situation. It's not a clear-cut betrayal if the feelings have genuinely shifted. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to leave if they're unhappy and the relationship isn't working anymore. The answer would be B (No).\n"
