I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 5 years, engaged, and the SO is in prison for drug-related charges for 10+ years. The author initially committed to supporting their SO but is now feeling conflicted. They don't look forward to speaking to him anymore, he's asking for money, and they think they're falling out of love. The SO's parents are supportive, and the author feels guilty about potentially breaking up.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my perspective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's start with the initial commitment. The author said they would be there no matter what, which is a strong promise. But now, things are changing. The SO is in a long prison term, which is a huge life change. The author might be struggling with the reality of the situation. \n\nIs it wrong to change your mind? Well, relationships require mutual effort and support. If the SO is in prison and the author is trying to support him but is now feeling resentful because he's constantly asking for money, that's a valid emotional struggle. Long-distance relationships, especially with a prison sentence, are incredibly challenging. The author might be feeling isolated or overwhelmed. \n\nHowever, the commitment to stay through tough times is part of the relationship's foundation. The SO's parents are emphasizing how lucky he is, which adds pressure. But the author's feelings of guilt and the fear of hurting their partner and his family are real. \n\nNow, considering the options. If the author truly no longer wants to be in the relationship and has given it a fair shot, maybe it's not their fault. But if they made a promise and are breaking it without a genuine reason, that could be seen as wrong. The key factors here are the author's genuine feelings and the circumstances. \n\nThe SO's actions led to a 10-year sentence, which is a significant issue. The author is allowed to reevaluate their commitment when the relationship dynamics have changed so drastically. It's a tough situation, but it's a personal decision based on their own emotions and circumstances. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are facing a reality that's testing their initial commitment, and relationships can't be sustained if one person is no longer willing. The guilt is understandable, but it's their right to leave if the relationship isn't working anymore.\n"
