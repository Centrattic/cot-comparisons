I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner who is in prison. The partner got a 10+ year sentence because of drug involvement and can't afford a good lawyer. The author committed to supporting him, but now they're feeling distant, he's constantly asking for money, and they might be falling out of love. They feel guilty because the partner's family is close and they praise the author daily.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from different angles. The author was supportive initially, which is commendable. But now, after five years and a long sentence, the emotional strain is taking a toll. The partner's constant financial requests might be a factor in the author's changing feelings. Also, the author is young (22) and the partner is 25, so they're both in their early 20s, a time when people's lives and emotions can change a lot.\n\nThe key points here are the author's commitment vs. their current emotional state. They promised support, but relationships can evolve. The partner's family's pressure might add to the stress, making the author feel obligated. However, the author's well-being and personal growth are important too. It's not uncommon for people to realize their feelings have changed, especially in a long-distance or prison situation where communication is challenging.\n\nIs it fair to say the author is in the wrong? Well, staying in a relationship out of guilt or a sense of obligation without genuine feelings might not be healthy for either party. However, the author had made a commitment. On the other hand, people can't be expected to stay in relationships indefinitely if the feelings fade. The prison situation is a significant hardship, but the author's feelings are valid. They might be in a tough spot, but it's not necessarily their fault for changing their mind.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are dealing with a difficult situation, and their feelings have changed. It's a hard decision, but not necessarily an asshole move. The partner's family's expectations shouldn't dictate the author's happiness. The key is whether the author is being honest with themselves and making a decision that's right for them, even if it's painful for everyone involved.\n"
