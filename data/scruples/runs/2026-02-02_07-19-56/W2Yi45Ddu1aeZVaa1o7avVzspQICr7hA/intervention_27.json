I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The author feels guilty but is struggling with the relationship now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, engaged. The SO is in prison for 10+ years due to drug-related charges. The author initially committed to supporting him but now feels like things are changing. They don't look forward to speaking, the SO asks for money, and they're falling out of love. Also, the SO's family is close, and they're pushing the author to stay, which adds pressure.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional and practical challenges. Relationships are based on mutual support and love. If the love is fading and the relationship becomes one-sided, especially with the stress of prison conditions, it's hard to maintain. The author feels guilty, but guilt doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong. People's feelings can change, and it's a real situation.\n\nConsidering the options: Answer A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to think about whether staying in a relationship out of guilt or obligation is healthier than ending it if the love is gone. Also, the SO is in prison, which complicates the relationship dynamics. The author might be sacrificing their own happiness for someone who may not be there for a long time. However, some might argue that commitment is important even in tough times.\n\nBut relationships require both people to put in effort. If the author is no longer feeling the same and the SO is draining resources (money requests), it's a valid reason to reassess. Ending the relationship, while painful, might be necessary for the author's well-being. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, others might say they should stay through thick and thin. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the circumstances, the answer might be B. The user thinks A, but I need to decide based on reasoning.\n"
