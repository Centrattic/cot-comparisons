I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for possibly leaving their SO who's in prison. The situation is that they've been together 5 years, got engaged, then the SO went to prison for drugs with a 10+ year sentence. Initially, the author was supportive but now feels strained.\n\nSo, the key points here are: their relationship has changed, the SO is in prison which complicates the relationship, financial strain from sending money, emotional drift (falling out of love), and the pressure from in-laws.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Being in prison is a huge life change. The author made a commitment, but circumstances have evolved. The SO is in prison, which isn't their fault, but the author's feelings have shifted. They feel guilty, which shows they care about his feelings and his family's reaction. However, relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection. If the author is losing love and the relationship is becoming a burden, is that their fault?\n\nAlso, the SO's situation is challenging, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling. People have limits to their support, especially when it affects their own well-being. The guilt might be natural, but it doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that leaving someone in prison is harsh, but the author isn't abandoning them entirely\u2014they've been supportive so far. They just can't continue the relationship. The SO's actions led to the imprisonment, but that's not the author's fault. The author is dealing with real emotional changes and stress.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. Ending the relationship is a personal choice based on changing circumstances. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
