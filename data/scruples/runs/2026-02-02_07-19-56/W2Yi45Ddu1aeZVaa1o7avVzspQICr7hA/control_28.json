I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. The SO was sentenced to 10+ years for drug-related issues. The author says they used to support him, but now they're feeling distant, he's asking for money, and they're close to his family who are pushing them to stay. They're conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are the emotional commitment, the SO's situation, and the author's feelings. When someone makes a commitment, especially like engagement, staying together during hard times is often expected. But relationships also require mutual support and emotional connection. If the author is losing feelings and the relationship is becoming one-sided (like asking for money constantly), maybe it's okay to end it. However, leaving someone in prison might be seen as harsh, especially if the author had previously promised support. But the author's well-being is also important. They might be in a position where they can't sustain the relationship anymore. \n\nOn the other hand, the SO's family is pressuring them, which might add guilt. But relationships shouldn't be maintained just to avoid hurting others' feelings. The author's feelings are valid. So, the answer depends on whether the decision is selfish or a realistic assessment of the relationship's health. Since the author isn't staying just for appearances but because of genuine emotional distance and stress, it's not necessarily wrong. So answer B.\n"
