I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they leave their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: they've been together 5 years, got engaged, and then the SO went to prison for drug-related issues with a 10+ year sentence. The author initially vowed to support him, but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to talk to him as much, and he's constantly asking for money. The family is also pressuring the author, saying he's lucky to have them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole (in the wrong) for breaking up. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider a few things. The author was committed to staying with their partner despite the incarceration, which is challenging. Now, they're experiencing emotional changes and practical issues like financial requests and family pressure. \n\nEmotionally, it's natural for feelings to shift over time, especially in a long-term relationship. The stress of a partner in prison can strain even the strongest relationships. The SO's constant money asks might be a factor here; if it's becoming a financial burden or a point of conflict, that's a valid reason for the author to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nThe family's role is also important. If they're using guilt or daily reminders about their son's good fortune, that pressure could be affecting the author's decision. But the author's own feelings and circumstances matter too. They can't be expected to stay in a relationship if they're no longer in love, especially when it's causing them distress.\n\nLegally and ethically, the author isn't obligated to stay with their partner just because he's in prison. Relationships are based on mutual consent and feelings, not on obligation. The SO's actions led to the imprisonment, which might have changed the dynamics of the relationship. The author's right to their own happiness and well-being is a key point here.\n\nHowever, breaking up might cause emotional pain to the SO and his family. But that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. People have the right to make choices that affect their own lives, even if those choices are painful for others. It's a tough situation, but the author's feelings and need for a healthy relationship should be considered.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the author is dealing with personal and emotional challenges that affect their relationship, and it's reasonable for them to reassess their commitment. The key is whether the decision is made out of self-respect and mutual benefit rather than selfishness. The scenario suggests the author is feeling guilty and conflicted, which might indicate they're considering the impact on others, but their own well-being is also a factor. The SO's actions led to the imprisonment, which is a significant life change, and the author's changing feelings are valid.\n"
