      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong if they end their relationship with their significant other while he's in prison. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years. The author is 22, their SO is 25. They got engaged, but around the same time, the SO was sent to prison for drug-related issues. The sentence is 10+ years because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author initially committed to supporting him, saying they wouldn't leave. Now, things have changed: the author isn't looking forward to talking to him anymore, he asks for money frequently, and they're starting to fall out of love. The SO's parents are pushing the author to stay, making them feel guilty. The author is conflicted about breaking up because they know it would hurt him and his family, but they're also feeling guilty themselves.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nTo decide, I should consider factors like commitment, circumstances, emotional well-being, and societal expectations. When someone makes a commitment to support their partner through tough times, like during imprisonment, it's a significant promise. However, relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection. If the relationship is becoming one-sided\u2014like the SO constantly asking for money and the author no longer feeling love\u2014it might be affecting the author's well-being. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the initial commitment. The author said they wouldn't leave, and breaking that could be seen as a betrayal, especially during a time when the SO is vulnerable. On the other hand, people can change their feelings over time, especially under prolonged stress. The SO's family is adding pressure, which complicates things further. \n\nHowever, staying in a relationship out of guilt or obligation without genuine feelings might not be healthy for either party. The author might genuinely feel they can't sustain the relationship anymore. But is that a valid reason? It's possible that the author is in a difficult situation, trying to balance their emotional needs with their previous commitment.\n\nAnother angle: the SO's actions led to his imprisonment. If the author stays, is it enabling his behavior? Or is it just supporting him during his sentence? The original engagement was before the imprisonment, so the author might not be responsible for his current actions. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, some people might view breaking up as selfish, especially when the partner is in prison. Others might understand that the author can't maintain a relationship without love and support. The key here is whether the author's decision is based on genuine feelings or just external pressures.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong. Relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection, and if those elements are fading, it's reasonable for the author to reassess. While the initial commitment is important, people's circumstances and feelings can change, especially in a long-term situation like a prison sentence. The author's well-being and ability to maintain the relationship should also be considered. So the answer might be B.\n"
