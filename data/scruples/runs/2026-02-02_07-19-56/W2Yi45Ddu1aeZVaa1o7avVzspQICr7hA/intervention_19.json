I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The couple has been together for five years. The author is 22, the SO is 25. They got engaged, but then he went to prison for drug involvement. The sentence is 10+ years because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author initially committed to supporting him but now things are changing. She's not looking forward to speaking to him anymore, he's asking for money frequently, she's falling out of love, and his parents are pressuring her. She feels guilty about breaking up with him.\n\nThe key points here are commitment, emotional support, financial strain, and changing feelings. She promised to stay with him, but circumstances have changed. She's struggling with her emotions and the reality of the situation. The SO can't afford a good lawyer, leading to a longer sentence, which might be a contributing factor. \n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. Commitment is a big part of relationships, especially when someone is in prison. However, people's feelings can change, and staying in a relationship when love is fading might be unhealthy. Also, financial stress from supporting him could add to the burden. On the other hand, breaking up might cause emotional distress to him and his family, especially since they've been told he's lucky to have her. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, relationships are complex. If she's no longer in love and can't maintain the relationship, it's not necessarily \"wrong\" to end it. However, the initial promise to support him might weigh on her decision. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about commitment. However, since the question is about being an \"asshole,\" it's more about social judgment. Breaking a promise could be seen as selfish, but staying in an unhappy relationship isn't healthy either. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her decision is based on genuine emotional disconnection and inability to support him, which might be seen as reasonable. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. Some might argue that she's not in the wrong because staying in a loveless relationship isn't sustainable. Others might say she's breaking a promise. But the question is whether she's the asshole. Breaking up could be hurtful, but it's a personal choice. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
