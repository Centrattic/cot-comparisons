I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship while their significant other (SO) is in prison.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years. The author is 22, the SO is 25. They got engaged, but then the SO was sentenced to 10+ years in prison for drug-related issues due to inadequate legal representation. The author initially committed to supporting them but now feels they're falling out of love, are stressed from frequent money requests, and are close to breaking up, which would hurt the SO and their family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, staying with someone in prison is challenging, and the author might be experiencing emotional strain, losing feelings, and financial pressure. Relationships are about mutual support and love; if those are fading, it's natural to reconsider. Also, the SO's legal issues and the harsh sentence might impact the relationship's future.\n\nOn the other hand, the author made a commitment to support the SO during the engagement. Breaking up might feel like a betrayal, especially since the family is reminding them of their importance. The SO is in a vulnerable situation, and leaving could add emotional distress. However, staying in a relationship without love or support might not be healthy for the author either.\n\nEthically, it's about autonomy and well-being. The author has the right to their own happiness and shouldn't be forced into a relationship they're no longer committed to. However, the timing and method of the breakup matter. If done with compassion, considering the SO's mental state, it might be less harsh.\n\nIn many cases, long-distance or prison relationships are already strained. The author's feelings changing over time are natural. They're not obligated to stay out of guilt. The key is whether the decision is made with empathy and clear communication, minimizing harm.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because relationships require mutual commitment and emotional investment. If the author can no longer provide that, it's reasonable to end it, even though it's difficult. The author isn't at fault for changing feelings, especially under such circumstances.\n"
