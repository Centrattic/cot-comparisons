I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after considering leaving their partner who's in prison for 10+ years. The author has been with their SO for 5 years, got engaged, and then the SO went to prison. Initially, they wanted to support him, but now they're feeling distant, don't want to talk to him anymore, and he's asking for money all the time. They also mention their in-laws are pushing the idea of them staying because it's a good situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The SO is in a long prison sentence, which is a huge stressor. The author has been supportive initially but is now feeling overwhelmed. The SO's constant requests for money might be a financial burden. Also, the author is young, 22, and the relationship might have changed over time. They mention falling out of love, which is a significant factor in any relationship's sustainability.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who got involved in drugs and landed in prison. They've already committed to supporting him, but that doesn't mean they have to stay if the relationship is no longer healthy. It's important to consider the emotional toll of a long-distance relationship, especially with someone in prison. The pressure from the SO's family is another factor; they might be trying to make the author feel guilty for leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up would cause emotional pain to the SO and his family. But the author's well-being is also important. They might not have the same level of connection anymore, and staying could be more harmful in the long run if there's no love left. The author isn't being malicious; they're making a difficult decision based on their feelings and circumstances. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship has deteriorated to the point where there's no love and the SO is using the author for money, then ending it isn't necessarily wrong. People have the right to reassess their relationships, especially under such stress. However, the decision should be made with empathy and consideration for the SO's feelings, perhaps providing support during the transition. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a personal decision based on their emotional and possibly financial well-being, and it's not their fault that the situation has changed.\n"
