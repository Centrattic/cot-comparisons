I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO who's in prison. So the scenario is, they've been together 5 years, got engaged when the SO was sent to prison for a drug-related offense with a long sentence. The person initially said they'd support them but now feels differently. They don't look forward to talking to him anymore, he's always asking for money, and they're starting to lose love. The SO's parents are pushing this idea that he's lucky to have them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person made a commitment during a difficult time, which is commendable. But over time, their feelings have changed. The SO is in prison, which is a tough situation, but the person is 22 and might be dealing with their own growth and changing emotions. The question is whether it's wrong to break up. \n\nLove is a complex emotion. If they're falling out of love, that's a valid reason to consider ending a relationship. But the SO's parents are making them feel guilty, maybe even implying that staying is expected. However, the person's well-being is important too. Staying in a relationship without love could be unhealthy for them long-term.\n\nAlso, the SO's behavior of constantly asking for money might be a factor. If that's becoming a source of stress and the person can't handle it anymore, that's a legitimate reason to step back. The prison sentence is long, so the person's future is uncertain. They might not be able to cope with the emotional and financial strain over 10+ years.\n\nOn the other hand, the person should be honest with their SO and the family. Breaking up after promising support could hurt, but it's also being honest about their current feelings. The person isn't obligated to stay in a relationship forever, especially if the feelings are no longer mutual or if the situation is becoming unsustainable.\n\nI think the key here is that while the initial support was good, the person has the right to reassess their feelings. It's not about being an asshole but about personal happiness and reality. So the answer would be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
