He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong if they leave their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The situation is that they've been together five years, got engaged, but the SO went to prison for drug-related issues. The author initially wanted to support him but now feels like they're out of love, are tired of being asked for money, and are close to breaking up. The question is whether they're an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The SO is in prison for 10+ years because of drug involvement. The author is 22, which is young, and the SO is 25. The author promised support initially but now feels different. The key points here are the emotional and practical challenges of maintaining a long-distance prison relationship, the toll it's taking on the author, and the pressure from the in-laws.\n\nPrison relationships are inherently difficult. The isolation, lack of physical contact, and the stress of the situation can strain even the strongest relationships. The author mentioned they've been through a lot, but now they're feeling resentful because the SO is asking for money. That's understandable because financial strain can be a major stressor. Also, the SO's family, while well-meaning, might be adding pressure by constantly reminding the author of their supposed duty to support him, which could be making the author feel trapped.\n\nThe author is considering breaking up but feels guilty. The question is about whether they're in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether they're being fair and honest. The SO can't afford a good lawyer, leading to a longer sentence, but that doesn't necessarily absolve him of responsibility in the relationship. The author has the right to their own well-being. If the relationship is causing more harm than good and there's a loss of love, it's reasonable to end it, as long as it's handled with compassion.\n\nHowever, the author needs to communicate this respectfully to avoid unnecessary hurt. But guilt-tripping from the in-laws and the SO's constant requests for money might be exacerbating the situation. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's becoming toxic. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), because they're making a tough choice based on their feelings and circumstances, not out of selfishness but self-preservation.\n"
