I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner who's in prison for drug-related charges. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: they've been together five years, engaged. The partner went to prison for drugs, got a 10+ year sentence. The author initially wanted to support them but now feels different. They don't want to talk as much, he asks for money, and the author is falling out of love. Also, the partner's parents are pushing the author to stay, making them feel guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is struggling with their feelings. They feel they're being pressured by the in-laws, and they're experiencing guilt. The partner is in prison, which is a significant challenge, but the author is considering ending the relationship because their feelings have changed.\n\nIs it wrong to leave? Well, relationships require mutual effort. If the author's feelings have genuinely changed and they can't maintain the relationship, it's not necessarily their fault. People can fall out of love, especially under stress. The partner in prison might not be able to change their situation, and the author might feel they can't sustain the relationship. However, the partner is in prison, which complicates things. They might not be able to ask for the breakup in person, so the communication is harder. Also, the partner's parents are adding pressure, which could cloud the author's judgment.\n\nBut the author is 22 and the partner is 25. They're young, and maybe the author is feeling trapped in a long-term commitment with someone who can't be physically present. The financial strain and emotional burden could be overwhelming. The partner asking for money might be causing stress, especially if the author can't afford to help. \n\nOn the other hand, the author initially committed to staying. If they break up now, it might hurt the partner and the family, as they've been told they're lucky to have support. But the author has every right to re-evaluate their feelings. It's a tough situation, but it's not necessarily the author's fault if they're not in love anymore. They deserve happiness, and staying in a relationship that's causing them pain might not be healthy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They're dealing with a lot, and their feelings are valid. Ending the relationship, while painful, could be necessary for their well-being. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
