I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. \n\nFirst, the context: They've been together five years, got engaged, but the SO got a 10+ year sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now feels disconnected. They mention the SO constantly asking for money and the author feeling like they're falling out of love. The guilt comes from the family's support and the potential hurt to the SO.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspect. The author isn't in the prison, so they have their freedom. Maintaining a long-distance relationship, especially with such a long sentence, is incredibly challenging. The SO's financial struggles might add stress. The author's feelings changing over time is natural; people evolve. The question is whether leaving is wrong.\n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong: They made a commitment, but circumstances have changed. They're not staying out of obligation but because their feelings have shifted. The SO's own actions (drugs leading to prison) might have already caused the separation. The author deserves happiness and shouldn't feel trapped in a relationship that's deteriorating.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong: They promised to support him, so breaking that promise could be seen as a betrayal. The SO is in a vulnerable position, and ending the relationship might cause emotional distress. The family's perspective adds pressure, implying the author should stay for the SO's sake.\n\nBut the key point is the author's current feelings and circumstances. The SO's actions led to the prison sentence, which is a major life change. The author isn't staying out of duty but because their emotions have changed. It's their right to reassess the relationship. The guilt they feel is understandable, but they're not obligated to stay if the relationship isn't fulfilling anymore.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because personal feelings and evolving circumstances justify their decision, even though it's a tough choice.\n"
