I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're an asshole for leaving their significant other who's in prison. They've been together five years, got engaged, but he went to prison for 10+ years due to drug issues. She promised support but now she's feeling distant, he's asking for money, and she's losing love. She's close to his family, who pressure her by saying he's lucky.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if she's in the wrong. The question is whether she's the asshole. So, the key points here: she made a commitment to support him, but circumstances have changed. She's struggling with her feelings and the pressure from his family. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, people can change. If she's no longer in love and can't see a future, staying might not be healthy for either of them. The prison situation complicates things because visiting and communication are harder. Also, his asking for money all the time could be a strain. \n\nShe's feeling guilty, which shows she cares about his feelings and his family's. But guilt isn't necessarily a sign of being wrong. People have the right to their own happiness. However, breaking up with someone in prison is a big deal. It's important to consider the emotional impact on him. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? If she's not in love anymore, and the relationship is causing her stress, then maybe not. She's not obligated to stay just because of a commitment made before the incarceration. Relationships require mutual effort, and if he's not there to support her or if the dynamic is unbalanced (like constant money requests), that's a valid reason to reassess.\n\nOn the other hand, she did promise to stay, so breaking that might feel like a betrayal. But she's still young\u201422 and 25. A 10-year prison sentence is a long time. Her feelings changing could be a natural part of the situation's reality. The pressure from his family might also be influencing her, but she needs to make her own decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No). She's not in the wrong because she's allowed to change her mind, especially if the relationship isn't healthy anymore. While it's a tough call and will hurt him, it's not her fault for prioritizing her well-being.\n"
