I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. The situation is that they've been together five years, got engaged, and now he's serving a 10+ year sentence for drug-related issues. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now feels she's falling out of love, he's asking for money, and she's conflicted about ending things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Being with someone in prison is extremely challenging. The author has been through a lot, and maintaining a relationship under such circumstances is not easy. The SO's family is also putting pressure by reminding her how lucky he is to have her. That might be adding to her stress.\n\nThe key points here are the initial commitment versus current feelings. She said she wanted to support him, but now she's struggling. People's feelings can change over time, especially when the situation is as difficult as this. It's important to note that relationships require mutual effort. If the SO is constantly asking for money without contributing or showing growth, that could be a valid reason for her to reconsider.\n\nHowever, leaving someone in prison is a major decision. She'd have to weigh her own well-being against the impact on him and his family. But it's also her life; she's only 22, and she might need to prioritize her own mental health and future. Love can fade under prolonged stress and lack of reciprocation. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, staying in a relationship that's causing her emotional distress might not be healthy. She's not obligated to stay just because she made a promise. People can change their minds when circumstances evolve. The SO's actions (drug involvement) led to the prison sentence, which is a significant factor. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking the news would be hurtful. But the author isn't being cruel; she's being honest with her feelings. The question is whether she's wrong for acting on her changed emotions. Since she's not the one who broke the law, and her decision is based on her current emotional state, it's more about self-care than selfishness. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. She's dealing with a tough situation and making a personal choice based on her feelings and circumstances.\n"
