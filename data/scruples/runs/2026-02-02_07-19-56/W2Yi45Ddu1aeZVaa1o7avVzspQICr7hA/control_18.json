I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They've been together for five years, got engaged, then the SO went to prison for drugs with a 10+ year sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now they're feeling distant, the SO asks for money constantly, and the author is considering breaking up. They're worried about hurting him and his family.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. When a relationship is long-term and there's a significant life change like incarceration, it can put a lot of strain on both partners. The author made a commitment, but circumstances have changed. They feel they're falling out of love and the constant financial requests are a burden. The SO's family is also pressuring them by saying the SO is lucky to have them.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, staying in a relationship out of obligation versus genuine feeling can be tough. The author might feel guilty for breaking the promise, but people's feelings and situations can evolve. The key here is that the author is reflecting on their own emotions and whether they can continue the relationship sustainably.\n\nThere's no one-size-fits-all answer, but generally, people have the right to their own happiness and emotional well-being. If the author is no longer in love and feels the relationship is becoming unhealthy or one-sided, it's not necessarily wrong to leave. The SO's family might disapprove, but the decision is about the author's own needs as well as the relationship's current state.\n\nHowever, the author should consider how to end the relationship compassionately, considering the SO's incarceration. The main point is that the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and circumstances, especially if the relationship is no longer fulfilling. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
