I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) who's in prison for drug-related charges. The SO has a 10+ year sentence, and the author is struggling with their feelings, financial strain, and emotional support.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The relationship has been five years, and the author was committed to supporting their SO even after the arrest. Now, the author is feeling resentful due to constant financial requests, losing interest, and the pressure from the SO's family. The key here is whether the author has an obligation to stay in the relationship despite these challenges.\n\nIn terms of morality or societal judgment, people often expect partners to support each other through tough times. However, relationships are also about mutual respect and emotional well-being. The author is not at fault for changing feelings over time. It's natural for emotions to shift, especially under prolonged stress. The SO's ongoing financial demands could be a significant strain, and the author's mental health and future should be considered.\n\nThe SO's family's comments might add guilt, but that's their perspective, not necessarily the author's responsibility. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's becoming harmful to their own well-being. While breaking up would cause pain, it's not inherently wrong if the author feels it's necessary for their own happiness and growth.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to maintain a relationship once it's no longer healthy. The author's decision isn't about abandoning someone but about making a choice that's right for themselves. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're facing a tough situation with valid reasons to reconsider the relationship, and their choice to leave doesn't make them an asshole; it's a personal decision based on their circumstances.\n"
