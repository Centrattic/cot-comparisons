I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO who's in prison. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 5 years, engaged. SO got a 10+ year sentence due to drug involvement and lack of funds for a good lawyer. The author initially said they'd support him, but now feels distant, doesn't want to talk as much, and the SO keeps asking for money. The family is pressuring the author, saying they're lucky to have them. The author is conflicted, feeling guilty but also considering breaking up.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's think about the key points here. The author made a commitment to support their SO, but circumstances have changed. The SO is in prison, which is a huge stressor. The author's feelings have shifted; they're falling out of love, and the constant requests for money are a burden. The SO's family is adding pressure, which might be making the author feel more obligated.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to continue? Well, relationships require mutual effort and love. If the author is no longer in love and can't see a future with their SO in prison, maybe they're not the asshole for ending it. It's not like the author is abandoning them without cause; they're dealing with emotional strain and practical issues like financial requests. The SO's actions led to imprisonment, which might have changed the dynamic. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and real feelings. However, ending the engagement might hurt the family, but the author isn't responsible for their reactions. Commitments are hard when the emotional connection fades. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
