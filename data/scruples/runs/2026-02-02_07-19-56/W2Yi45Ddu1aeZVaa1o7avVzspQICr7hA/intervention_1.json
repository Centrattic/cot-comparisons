I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner while he's in prison. The situation is that they've been together five years, got engaged, but then the partner went to prison for drug-related issues. The author supported him initially, but now they're not as happy, feel burdened by his constant money requests, and are thinking about breaking up. They feel guilty because of the family's constant praise about how lucky he is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Long-distance relationships are tough, especially when one person is incarcerated. The author is dealing with emotional strain and financial pressure. The partner is asking for money all the time, which could be a point of stress. The author is also young (22 and 25), so their relationship might still be developing. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, both partners should communicate and support each other, but there are limits. If the author is feeling that they are no longer in love and the situation is becoming unbearable, it's understandable they might consider ending things. However, leaving someone in prison could be seen as abandoning them, especially if they had made a commitment. But on the other hand, the author can't be expected to stay in a relationship that's causing them significant distress and no longer fulfilling their emotional needs.\n\nThe family's role is also a factor. The parents' constant reminders might add pressure, but the author's feelings are their own. The author isn't the one in prison, so they have the autonomy to make this decision. It's important to note that the author isn't cutting off support entirely but is considering ending the relationship, which is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships require mutual effort. If the relationship has changed and one person is no longer able to maintain it, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for ending it. However, breaking up with someone in prison might have emotional consequences, but the author's well-being is also important. \n\nSo, the author's decision isn't a matter of right or wrong in a black-and-white sense. They're dealing with real emotions and challenges. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but upon reflection, it's a complex situation where the author is making a personal decision based on their feelings and circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
