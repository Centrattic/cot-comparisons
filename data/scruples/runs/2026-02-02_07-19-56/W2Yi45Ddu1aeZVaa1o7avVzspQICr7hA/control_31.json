I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The answer needs to be either A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The SO has been in prison for 10+ years after a drug conviction. The author has been with him for five years, is 22, and he's 25. They got engaged just before he went to prison. The author supported him initially but now feels distant, he's always asking for money, and she's close to his family who remind her daily how lucky he is. She's feeling guilty about breaking up.\n\nNow, the key points here are about commitment, the reality of long-term incarceration, emotional changes over time, and the impact of the breakup on both families. The question is whether she's in the wrong for deciding to end the relationship.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, when someone makes a commitment, especially marriage or engagement, staying together through hard times is expected. However, the situation is complicated by the prison sentence. Supporting someone in prison is very different from a regular long-distance relationship. The emotional toll, financial strain (asking for money all the time), and the fact that she's falling out of love are significant factors.\n\nOn one hand, breaking up might hurt his family and him, but on the other hand, maintaining a relationship that's no longer fulfilling for her might not be healthy for either party. Also, considering she's only 22, she's at a stage in life where personal growth and future plans are important. Staying in a loveless relationship could hinder her development.\n\nLegally, she's not in the wrong because she's allowed to end a relationship. Emotionally, it's a tough call, but she's not obligated to stay just because of past promises, especially when circumstances have drastically changed. The family's comments about him being lucky might add pressure, but her well-being matters too.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be B (No), she's not in the wrong. She's entitled to her feelings and future, even if ending the relationship is painful. People can't be expected to stay in a relationship that's no longer working, especially under such challenging circumstances.\n"
