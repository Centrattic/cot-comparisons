He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The question is presented as a \"Would I Be A Total Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for five years, engaged. The SO is in prison for drug-related crimes, serving a 10+ year sentence. The author is 22, the SO is 25. Initially, the author was committed to supporting their partner, but now they're feeling distant, the SO is asking for money frequently, and they're close to the family who are pushing the author to stay. The author is conflicted, feeling guilty but also losing interest.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The answer needs to be either A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider the ethics and social norms around long-distance, prison-based relationships. On one hand, staying loyal could be seen as commendable, especially during a difficult time. The author had initially committed to supporting their partner, which shows dedication. However, relationships are also about mutual respect and the well-being of both partners. If the author is losing interest, feeling used (because the SO asks for money), and the relationship is no longer fulfilling, then ending it might be a self-preservation measure.\n\nThe family's constant reminders about how lucky the SO is might add pressure, but the author's feelings are their own. The SO's situation is serious, but the author's emotional health and future are also important. Relationships shouldn't be maintained out of guilt or obligation if they're no longer healthy.\n\nIn terms of social perception, some might view breaking up as selfish, especially given the circumstances. Others might see it as realistic and necessary for the author's well-being. The key here is that the author isn't being abusive or malicious; they're struggling with their feelings and the practical aspects of the relationship. The SO's behavior (asking for money frequently) might be contributing to the strain.\n\nTherefore, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the perspective. Legally and ethically, ending a relationship isn't a matter of right or wrong, but in terms of social judgment, people might have differing opinions. However, considering the author's reasons (loss of love, financial strain, emotional distance), it's more about personal circumstances rather than malicious intent. Hence, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a difficult decision based on their current feelings and situation, not out of malice.\n"
