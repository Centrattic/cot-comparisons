I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner who's in prison. The author mentions they've been together for five years, got engaged, and the partner is serving a 10+ year sentence for drug-related issues. The author initially committed to supporting them but now feels resentment, especially with financial requests and emotional distance. They also feel guilty because the partner's family is close and supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications. Relationships require mutual effort and respect. The partner made a choice that led to incarceration, but the author also has their own well-being to consider. Staying in a relationship solely out of guilt or a sense of obligation might not be healthy. The author is experiencing emotional changes, which are valid. However, breaking up while someone is in prison could add emotional distress during an already difficult time. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong for recognizing their feelings and considering their own needs. It's possible to be compassionate while also prioritizing one's own mental health. The partner's family's constant reminders about the author's support might be adding pressure. The author might feel trapped between their commitment and their current feelings.\n\nI need to assess whether the author's decision is selfish. Ending the engagement is a personal choice, especially when the relationship is causing more harm than good. The partner's actions led to the prison sentence, but the author isn't responsible for their partner's choices. However, the timing and method of the breakup matter. If handled with empathy, it's more considerate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're making a decision based on their changing emotions and circumstances. They aren't necessarily wrong for choosing themselves, especially if the relationship isn't fulfilling anymore. The key is whether they're being cruel without cause. Since the partner is in prison and the author's feelings are genuine, it's a tough situation but not necessarily the author's fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
