I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they leave their significant other while he's in prison. The answer should be either A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for five years, the SO is in prison for 10+ years due to drug involvement and couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author (probably the girlfriend or fianc\u00e9e) initially promised support but now feels they're falling out of love, don't look forward to speaking, and he's constantly asking for money. She's close with his family, who pressure her by saying he's lucky to have her. She feels guilty but is considering breaking up.\n\nThe key points here are the initial commitment, the current emotional state, and the family's influence. When someone is in prison, maintaining a relationship can be challenging. The author is struggling with her feelings and the practical aspects (like financial requests). The family's comments might be adding to the pressure, making her feel obligated to stay. \n\nMarriage and long-term relationships require mutual respect and support. However, when one person's needs aren't being met, or the relationship is causing harm, it's a complex situation. The original promise was made in a different context, and people's emotions can change over time, especially under prolonged stress. \n\nThe SO's behavior of constantly asking for money could be a significant factor. If this is causing the author financial strain or emotional distress, it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship. Also, falling out of love is a natural occurrence; relationships aren't static. \n\nThe family's daily reminders about how lucky he is might be manipulative, making her feel guilty for leaving. It's important to consider whether the author is being pressured or if she's making a decision based on her own well-being. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about personal choice and circumstances. The author's decision to end the relationship isn't necessarily a betrayal if the relationship has become unsustainable or if both parties aren't happy. However, the guilt she feels suggests she might be torn between her personal feelings and the initial commitment. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she leaves due to legitimate reasons like emotional distance and financial burden, especially with a spouse in prison, it's not inherently wrong. People have the right to assess their happiness and future. Staying in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling could be harmful too. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she made a promise and should follow through, but promises can be reconsidered if the circumstances have changed drastically. The prison sentence is a long term, which adds to the pressure. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong if her decision is based on her own well-being and the relationship isn't healthy anymore. It's a tough call, but her feelings and the changing dynamics are valid reasons.\n"
