I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) who's in prison for a drug-related offense. The SO got a 10+ year sentence partly because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author has been supportive for five years but is now feeling distant, especially since their SO is constantly asking for money and they're falling out of love. The SO's parents are also pushing the idea that the author is being kind by staying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The SO's sentence is a legal matter, and while it's unfortunate he couldn't afford a good lawyer, the author isn't responsible for that. Relationships are based on mutual effort, and if one person is losing interest or feeling overwhelmed, that's a personal issue. The author's feelings of being used (asking for money constantly) and losing love are valid reasons for wanting to end the relationship. \n\nHowever, there's the emotional impact on the SO and his family. The author feels guilty about hurting them. But relationships should be healthy for both parties. Staying in a relationship out of obligation rather than love might not be the healthiest choice for the author. It's important to recognize that while the author was committed initially, circumstances have changed, and personal well-being is important. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. If someone is no longer in love and feels they can't support the relationship healthily, ending it isn't necessarily wrong. However, it's crucial to handle it with empathy and care to minimize harm. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because maintaining a relationship without love or under constant stress can be detrimental. The author isn't obligated to stay just because they made a commitment before the incarceration, especially if the relationship dynamics have changed.\n"
