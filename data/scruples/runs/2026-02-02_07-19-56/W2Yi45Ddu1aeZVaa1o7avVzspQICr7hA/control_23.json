I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other who is in prison. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been together for 5 years. The SO is in prison for 10+ years due to drug involvement, and the author, who's 22, has been supporting them. Now, they're feeling less connected, the SO is asking for money frequently, and the author is considering breaking up. The question is whether ending the relationship makes them an asshole.\n\nI should consider factors like commitment, emotional support, and personal well-being. The author initially vowed to support their partner, but circumstances have changed. Relationships require mutual effort, but with one person incarcerated, that dynamic is strained. The SO's constant requests for money might be a burden, and the author might be losing feelings. Also, the partner's family's pressure could be a stressor.\n\nHowever, leaving someone in prison is a significant decision. It's important to weigh the emotional impact on the SO and his family. But the author's well-being matters too. It's not clear if the SO is making efforts to improve or if the relationship is one-sided. The author might feel trapped or unappreciated. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships are complex. Commitment during hardship is admirable, but if the relationship is causing more harm than good, ending it isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether the author is being selfish or making a difficult but honest decision. Since the SO is in prison for a long time, the author's future might be limited if they stay. They're also young, which means their emotions and life goals could still be forming.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're facing a tough situation and making a personal choice that prioritizes their own emotional health. The answer should be B.\n"
