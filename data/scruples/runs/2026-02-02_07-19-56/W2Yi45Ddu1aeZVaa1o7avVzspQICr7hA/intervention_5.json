He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let me try to unpack this.\n\nFirst, some context: The author is 22, their SO is 25. They've been together five years, got engaged, then the SO was sent to prison for drug-related charges. The sentence is 10+ years. The author initially vowed to support them but now feels different. They're not looking forward to talking anymore, the SO is asking for money, and the author is falling out of love. They\u2019re close with the SO's family, who constantly remind them how lucky the SO is to have them. The author feels guilty about ending the relationship and is asking if they'd be an asshole for doing so.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Relationships are complex, and especially when one person is incarcerated. The author initially committed to staying, but circumstances have changed. The SO's behavior of asking for money might be a strain. The author's feelings are changing\u2014falling out of love is a valid reason for ending a relationship, even if it's hard.\n\nBut on the other hand, the SO is in prison, which is a tough situation. The author might feel pressure from the SO's family, who are pushing them to stay. However, the author's own well-being and happiness are important too. Staying in a relationship out of guilt or obligation without love might not be healthy for either person. The SO deserves to have a partner who is committed and supportive, not just someone who feels obligated. The author isn't breaking a legal contract or a commitment made in a formal setting like marriage; it's an engagement, which is more of a personal commitment. So ending it isn't necessarily wrong, even if it's painful.\n\nAnother angle: The SO's actions leading to imprisonment (drug involvement) might have contributed to the situation. The author's initial support is commendable, but relationships can change over time, especially under such stress. The key is whether the author is acting out of selfishness or genuine changed circumstances. If they're experiencing real emotional distance and the relationship is causing more harm than good, ending it isn't necessarily the wrong choice. People can't be expected to stay in relationships where they no longer feel love or connection, especially when the other person is contributing to the strain by constantly asking for money.\n\nBut maybe some would argue that the author made a promise and should honor it. However, engagement isn't a binding legal contract, and circumstances can change. It's possible that staying would be more harmful in the long run for both parties if there's no love left. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, people have the right to end relationships if they're no longer happy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship where their feelings have changed and the situation is causing them distress. The SO's family's pressure doesn't make the author wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being.\n"
