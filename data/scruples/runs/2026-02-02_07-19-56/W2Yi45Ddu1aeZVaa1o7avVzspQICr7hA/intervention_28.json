      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for five years. The author is 22, and the SO is 25. They got engaged around the time the SO was sent to prison for drug-related issues. The sentence is 10+ years because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. Initially, the author promised to support him, but now they feel they no longer want to speak to him, he's constantly asking for money, and they're falling out of love. The SO's parents are also pressuring the author daily, which adds to the stress.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Relationships require mutual effort. The SO is in prison and might not be contributing equally, especially if he's relying on the author financially. The author was supportive at first but now feels overwhelmed. Ending a relationship isn't always about right or wrong. It's about personal feelings and circumstances. The author might feel they can't sustain the relationship anymore. But they also feel guilty because they made a promise.\n\nOn one hand, staying might be unfair if there's no emotional connection left. On the other hand, breaking off communication could hurt him. But the SO's actions (drug involvement) led to his imprisonment, which complicates things. The author isn't responsible for his actions, but they did commit to supporting him once. However, people can change their feelings over time, especially when the relationship becomes unsustainable.\n\nThe SO's family's comments might add pressure, but the author's well-being is also important. If the author is losing love and the relationship is becoming a burden, it's reasonable for them to consider ending it. However, the way they approach the breakup would matter. Being honest and compassionate is key.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're ending it because they no longer have feelings or the situation is too much, maybe not. But if they're being selfish or not handling it respectfully, then yes. But given the scenario, it seems like their decision is based on genuine emotional change and stress, not being an asshole. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
