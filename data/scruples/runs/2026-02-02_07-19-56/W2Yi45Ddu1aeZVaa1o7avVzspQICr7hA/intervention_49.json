I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend considering leaving her fianc\u00e9 who is in prison for drug-related charges. They've been together five years, and she's 22, he's 25. She initially promised to support him, but now she's feeling distant, he's asking for money constantly, and she's falling out of love. She's close with his family, who praise her, and she feels guilty about breaking up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are her feelings of guilt, the circumstances of the relationship, and the impact of her decision. Relationships are complex, especially under such stress. When someone is in prison, the strain on the relationship can be immense. The woman was supportive at first, but over time, her feelings have changed. She's struggling with her emotions and the financial burden of supporting him. \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship when the feelings have changed? In many cases, people have the right to their own happiness. If the relationship is no longer fulfilling, and she's losing her love for him, it's possible that staying just because of a promise could prevent her from finding happiness. However, considering the context of his incarceration and the family dynamics, there's a sense of loyalty and expectation. His family is constantly reminding her of her support, which might add pressure on her to stay. \n\nBut is she obligated to stay in a relationship that's becoming toxic or unfulfilling? If the relationship is causing her emotional and financial strain, maybe she's not in the wrong for ending it. On the other hand, if she made a commitment during a difficult time and is now breaking it, some might see that as a betrayal of trust. However, people grow and change, and feelings can shift. \n\nThe question is whether her decision is morally wrong. It depends on cultural values and personal ethics. In some views, staying with someone in prison is seen as a noble sacrifice, but if the relationship is no longer healthy, it's reasonable. The guilt she feels is significant, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong. It's possible that she's in a tough spot where both choices have negative consequences. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because her feelings and the changing circumstances of the relationship are valid reasons to end it. People can't be expected to maintain a relationship if their emotions have shifted, especially under such challenging conditions.\n"
