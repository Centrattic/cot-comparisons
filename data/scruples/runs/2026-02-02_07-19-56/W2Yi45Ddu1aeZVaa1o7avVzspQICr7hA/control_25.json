I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner while he's in prison. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together five years. The author is 22, their SO is 25. They got engaged, but around the same time, the SO went to prison for drug-related issues. His sentence is 10+ years. The author vowed to support him initially, but now things are changing. The SO asks for money, they're losing interest in the relationship, and they feel guilty about breaking up, especially since the SO's family keeps reminding them of their support.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings changing, the financial strain, and the emotional pressure from the family. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship under these circumstances.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, staying together might be seen as loyal and supportive, especially given the initial commitment. On the other hand, maintaining a relationship when feelings have faded and it's causing stress might not be healthy for the author. The SO's family's comments could be adding pressure, but the author's own happiness and emotional well-being are also important.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-distance and under such stress as imprisonment, both partners need to meet each other's needs. If the author is struggling to maintain the relationship and isn't feeling the same connection, it's possible that ending it isn't the wrong thing. However, the author should handle the breakup with care to minimize harm, perhaps by being honest but compassionate.\n\nThe SO might feel abandoned, but the author isn't obligated to stay if they're unhappy. The family's perspective might be that support is crucial, but the author's well-being is also valid. There's no right or wrong answer in terms of morality here; it's more about personal feelings and circumstances. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing themselves, especially if the relationship is no longer fulfilling or sustainable.\n"
