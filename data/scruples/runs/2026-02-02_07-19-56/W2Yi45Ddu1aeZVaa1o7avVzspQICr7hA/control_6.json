He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) who is in prison for a drug-related offense.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The SO was sentenced to 10+ years due to drug involvement and can't afford a good lawyer. The writer has been with him for five years, got engaged, and initially vowed to support him. Now, after time, they feel they're falling out of love, don't want to talk to him as much, and he's constantly asking for money. They're close with his family, who keep reminding them how lucky he is to have them. The writer feels guilty about breaking up but is considering it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they break up. The answer options are A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nHmm. Relationships are complex. When someone is in prison, it's a huge strain. The writer initially committed to supporting their partner, which is commendable. But over time, emotions can change. Falling out of love is a personal experience; you can't force feelings. The constant financial requests might be a burden, especially if the writer is young (22) and perhaps not in a stable financial position themselves. The pressure from the SO's family, highlighting the writer's support, could add to the stress. The writer's guilt is understandable, as breaking up would hurt the SO and his family. However, staying in a relationship without love or when it's causing emotional and possibly financial strain might not be healthy for the writer. \n\nSociety often expects partners to stay loyal even in tough times, but personal well-being is also important. The writer isn't abandoning their partner without reason; they're struggling with their feelings. The SO's actions leading to his imprisonment might have already impacted the relationship's foundation. The writer isn't cutting off contact entirely but is considering ending the romantic aspect. It's a tough situation, but it's their life and feelings to manage. \n\nSo, while the writer might feel guilty, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional health and changing feelings. The key here is that the writer isn't acting out of malice but rather a shift in their personal circumstances and emotions. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). However, some might argue that they made a commitment, so leaving could be seen as breaking that. But commitments can be reevaluated, especially under such circumstances.\n"
