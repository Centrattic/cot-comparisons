I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend considering leaving her fianc\u00e9 who's in prison for drug-related charges. They've been together five years, got engaged around the time he went to prison. Now she's feeling distant, he's asking for money, and she's close to his family who keep reminding her how lucky he is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. She initially said she'd support him, but now things are changing. The question is whether ending the relationship makes her an asshole. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nI should break this down. The key points are commitment, changed circumstances, and emotional impact. She made a promise to support him, but circumstances have changed. People's feelings can evolve, especially under stress. The fianc\u00e9's behavior (asking for money) might contribute to her change of heart. Also, his family's constant reminders could be adding pressure.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual effort. If the relationship has deteriorated and there's no real possibility of reconciliation while he's incarcerated, maybe she's being honest about her feelings. But breaking a promise might be seen as a betrayal. However, people can't be expected to maintain feelings indefinitely, especially in such a difficult situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's been there for him and now is leaving, maybe she's being realistic. The fianc\u00e9's actions (asking for money) might be a legitimate reason for her to feel resentful. Also, the family's comments could be making her feel trapped. She might be prioritizing her own well-being.\n\nBut the initial commitment is strong. When you make promises, especially in a serious relationship, breaking them can hurt the other person. However, the situation is unique because he's in prison, which complicates things. She's not in prison, but he is, and the relationship is long-distance and challenging. Maybe she's realizing the reality of the situation.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. Commitment matters, but so does personal growth and emotional honesty. If she's genuinely no longer in love and the relationship is becoming toxic or unsustainable, then she's not in the wrong. But if she made a promise and is breaking it without a valid reason, that's different. The fact that he's asking for money all the time could be a strain. Also, being in prison for 10+ years is a long time; the relationship's future is uncertain.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether she's being truthful with her feelings and whether the relationship is still healthy. Since she's close to his family and they're adding pressure, maybe she's trying to make the right decision despite guilt. In that case, she's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
