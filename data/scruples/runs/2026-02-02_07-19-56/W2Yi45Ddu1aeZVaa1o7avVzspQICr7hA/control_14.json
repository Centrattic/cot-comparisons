He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for leaving their significant other while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together 5 years, got engaged, then he went to prison for drug-related issues. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now feels different. They don't look forward to speaking anymore, he's constantly asking for money, and they're falling out of love. The guilt comes from breaking the promise and hurting his family, who are supportive and close.\n\nI need to consider various perspectives. On one hand, the author made a promise to support him through tough times, which is admirable. But over time, their feelings have changed. Love can fade, especially under stress like a long prison sentence. The constant financial strain from asking for money might be a significant factor here. Relationships require mutual effort and support, and if one person is struggling to maintain it while the other is in a situation where they can't reciprocate, it could be healthy to end it. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that staying true to the promise is important, even if the feelings aren't there anymore. Also, the SO's family is close, and the author is part of their lives now. Breaking up might not just affect the couple but also the author's relationship with the family. But the author's well-being and emotional health are also important. Staying in a relationship that's becoming toxic or unfulfilling could be harmful in the long run.\n\nAnother angle is the reality of long-distance relationships, especially in prison. The challenges can be immense, and if the love is fading, maybe it's a natural progression. The author might not be in the wrong for recognizing that their feelings have changed and that the relationship isn't sustainable for them anymore. However, they should handle it with care and respect, perhaps explaining their feelings without being callous.\n\nFinancial strain is a big issue here. Constantly being asked for money might be a burden, especially if the author is young and possibly not in a strong financial position. If the SO isn't showing effort to change or manage his situation, it could be a point of contention. \n\nThe key factors are the author's commitment, the change in feelings, the financial pressure, and the impact on the family. While it's a tough decision, it's not necessarily about right or wrong. It's more about what's sustainable and healthy for the author. So, the answer would likely lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because maintaining a relationship that's lost its foundation can be valid if the feelings have changed. However, they need to communicate it honestly and compassionately.\n"
