I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) who is in prison. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 22, their SO is 25. They've been together five years and got engaged. The SO went to prison for drug-related issues, a 10+ year sentence. The author initially said they'd support him, but now they're feeling distant. The SO asks for money often, and the author thinks they're falling out of love. They're close with the SO's family, who remind them daily of their luck. The author feels guilty about possibly breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is: is the author in the wrong if they end the relationship? The user thinks the author is wrong (A), but wants to know others' thoughts.\n\nHmm. Relationships are complex. When someone is in prison, it's already a huge challenge. The author initially committed to supporting the SO, which is commendable. But over time, feelings can change. The SO's constant requests for money might be a strain. Also, the SO's family's pressure could add to the stress. The author is feeling guilt, which suggests they care about the SO's feelings and the family's reaction.\n\nBut does that mean they're in the wrong? Well, people's emotions can shift. If the love is fading, maybe staying just out of obligation isn't healthy. However, the initial commitment might weigh on the decision. The SO might rely on the author for emotional and financial support, and breaking up could impact their well-being. But the author's well-being is also important.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, there's no clear right or wrong. Some might argue that staying true to the initial promise is virtuous, while others might say it's okay to prioritize one's own happiness. The fact that the author feels guilty implies they're conflicted. The SO's actions (drug involvement) led to imprisonment, which is their own choice, but the author didn't cause that. The author's decision to leave isn't directly their fault if their feelings have genuinely changed. However, the financial requests might be a point\u2014does the author have an obligation to help financially? That's another layer. If the author can't afford it, maybe they're under pressure. But if they can afford it, maybe they feel it's unfair. \n\nThe key here is the author's feelings. If they're not in love anymore, staying might not be in their best interest. The SO's family's constant reminders could also be toxic. So, the author might not be in the wrong if they're acting based on their own emotional needs. But the guilt they feel shows they care about the consequences. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because people's feelings can change, and it's okay to prioritize their own well-being. The decision isn't easy, but it's a personal choice based on their circumstances. The author isn't necessarily wrong for considering breaking up, especially if the relationship is no longer fulfilling for them.\n"
