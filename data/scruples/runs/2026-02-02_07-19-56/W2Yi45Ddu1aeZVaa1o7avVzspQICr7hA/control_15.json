I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner while he's in prison. The scenario is that they've been together five years, got engaged, but he's now serving a 10+ year sentence for drug-related issues. The author is struggling because they don't want to talk to him anymore, he's asking for money, and they're falling out of love. They also mention the partner's family is pressuring them, which adds guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional and ethical aspects. The person made a commitment to support him, but circumstances have changed. It's natural for relationships to evolve, especially under such stress. Prison can put a strain on any relationship, and the distance and isolation might be contributing to their feelings. The partner's constant requests for money could be a source of stress too. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is being selfish or is acting in their own well-being. People have the right to their own happiness, and if the relationship is no longer fulfilling or is causing harm, it's not necessarily wrong to leave. However, the commitment they made and the guilt from breaking it might make others see it as a betrayal. \n\nOn the other hand, staying in a relationship out of obligation rather than genuine feelings can be harmful to both parties. The author might be protecting the partner's feelings or their family's expectations, but they have their own life to live. The answer hinges on whether the decision is based on self-care or selfishness. Since the author is struggling with their feelings and the relationship is deteriorating, it's more about their personal well-being. So, the answer would be B (they're not in the wrong).\n"
