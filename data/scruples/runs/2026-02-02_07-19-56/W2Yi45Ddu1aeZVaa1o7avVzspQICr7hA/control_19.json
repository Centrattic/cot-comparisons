I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO while he's in prison. The situation is that they've been together 5 years, engaged, then he got a 10+ year sentence for drug involvement. She supported him at first but now feels she's falling out of love and is tired of financial requests. She's close with his family who keep reminding her how lucky he is to have her, and she's worried about hurting them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. On one hand, she made a commitment to support him no matter what, but circumstances have changed. Her feelings have changed, and staying might not be healthy for her. On the other hand, breaking up could be seen as abandoning him during a tough time, especially in prison. But is that her responsibility? People can change their feelings and priorities.\n\nShe mentions he's asking for money all the time. That could be a significant stressor. Also, she's close to his family, which might complicate things. The guilt she feels is a big part here. Is she in the wrong if she chooses herself? Or is she supposed to stay just because of a past promise?\n\nIn relationships, both people need to work together. If one person is no longer emotionally present, maybe it's not fair to stay just out of obligation. But there's also the aspect of the engagement and how breaking it might affect him. However, staying in a relationship when love is diminishing might not be healthy for either party. \n\nI think the key here is that her feelings have changed. If she's not in love anymore and can't see herself being happy with him, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. People can't be expected to stay in a relationship if they're no longer emotionally connected. The fact that he's in prison complicates communication and support, but it doesn't mean she has a moral obligation to stay with him indefinitely. The guilt from his family's perspective is there, but their approval shouldn't dictate her personal happiness. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
