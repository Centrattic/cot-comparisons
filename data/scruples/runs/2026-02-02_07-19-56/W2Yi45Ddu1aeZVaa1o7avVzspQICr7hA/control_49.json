I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO who's in prison. The SO was sentenced to 10+ years for drug involvement, and the author is feeling guilty because they're no longer looking forward to the relationship, the SO is asking for money, and they're falling out of love. The family is supportive but maybe adding pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was committed to staying with their SO after the prison sentence. But now, after five years, their feelings have changed. Relationships require mutual effort, and if one person is losing interest or feeling unappreciated (due to constant money requests), it's natural to want out. However, the SO is in prison, which complicates things emotionally.\n\nThe author's commitment might have been made under different circumstances. When a relationship changes over time, it's not necessarily wrong to reassess. The key points here are the author's feelings of guilt versus their own well-being. Staying in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling could be harmful too. The family's comments might be making the author feel obligated, but the decision should be based on their own emotions and situation.\n\nAlso, the SO's inability to contribute and the financial strain could be a significant factor. The author isn't being selfish if the relationship is no longer sustainable. People can change their minds, especially in long-term commitments when circumstances shift. It's important to respect the initial commitment, but also to recognize that feelings can evolve. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
