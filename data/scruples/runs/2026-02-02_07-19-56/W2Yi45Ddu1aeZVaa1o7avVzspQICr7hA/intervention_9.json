I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is in a relationship with their significant other (SO) who is in prison for drug-related charges. They were engaged, but now the author is considering breaking up because they're falling out of love, the SO constantly asks for money, and the author no longer looks forward to talking to them. The SO's family is pressuring the author to stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. Relationships are built on mutual support and love. The author initially committed to being there for their partner, which shows a level of dedication. But now, after time, their feelings have changed. Is it wrong to end a relationship when the love has faded, especially when the partner is in a difficult situation like prison?\n\nOn one hand, staying true to one's feelings and not forcing a relationship is important. People can change, and if the love is gone, it might not be fair to either person to stay together. The author might be causing more harm by staying just out of obligation or guilt, which could lead to resentment. The SO deserves a partner who still loves and supports them, not someone who's just staying for other reasons.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of commitment. They were engaged, which typically signifies a deep commitment. The SO is in a tough situation, and leaving might seem like abandoning them. The author is also under pressure from the in-laws, which adds to the guilt. But is it wrong to prioritize one's own emotional well-being and current feelings?\n\nI should also consider the practical side. The SO is in prison, which is a long sentence. The author is young (22) and might have a lot of life ahead. Staying in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling could prevent them from moving forward. However, the SO might rely on the author for emotional and financial support during their incarceration.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's feelings changing, the ongoing requests for money, and the lack of anticipation in communication. These are signs that the relationship is deteriorating. The author might be in a position where they can't sustain the relationship healthily anymore. While it's painful to leave someone in a vulnerable state, it's also important for both parties to be in a relationship where there's genuine love and support.\n\nIn many ethical discussions, relationships require two people who are willing to work on them together. If the author is losing interest and the SO is not able to provide the necessary emotional support (assuming the author's needs aren't being met), then the relationship might not be healthy. The guilt from the family's comments shouldn't be the deciding factor here. The author's well-being is also important.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a difficult and sad situation, but ending a relationship when the love has faded isn't inherently wrong, especially when it's a mutual decision based on current feelings and circumstances. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
