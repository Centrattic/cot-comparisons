I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they leave their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: They've been together for five years. The writer is 22, the SO is 25. They got engaged, and then the SO went to prison for drug-related issues with a 10+ year sentence. The writer initially vowed to support him. Now, after some time, they're feeling distant, the SO constantly asks for money, and they're losing feelings. The SO's family is pressuring the writer, making them feel guilty. The question is if the writer is an asshole for ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial commitment, the current emotional and financial strain, and the guilt from the SO's family. \n\nThe writer is torn between their promise and their current feelings. They might feel they broke a promise by leaving, which could make them feel like they're wrong. But on the other hand, maintaining a relationship that's causing emotional distress and financial burden without reciprocal support might be taking a toll. The SO's family's comments could add to the pressure, making the writer feel even more conflicted.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships are complex. People can change, and circumstances can make sustaining a relationship difficult. The writer is considering their own well-being and the reality of the situation. While they might feel guilty, it's also important to recognize that their feelings and needs matter. It's not necessarily about being in the wrong but about personal circumstances and growth.\n\nThe SO's constant requests for money are a significant factor. If the writer is being taken advantage of or feels resentful, that's a valid reason to reevaluate the relationship. Also, the emotional distance and loss of love are personal factors that can't be ignored. The writer isn't obligated to stay in a relationship that's no longer fulfilling or sustainable, especially under such challenging conditions.\n\nHowever, breaking up might hurt the SO and his family, which the writer is considering. But it's also possible that staying in the relationship is causing more harm in the long run, both emotionally and financially. The writer's decision to leave could be a form of self-preservation and honesty about their changing feelings.\n\nSo, considering all these aspects, the answer would be that the writer isn't in the wrong. They're making a tough decision based on their current situation and feelings. It's a difficult choice, but it's not necessarily an asshole move if they're acting in good faith, even if it causes hurt.\n"
