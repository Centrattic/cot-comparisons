I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted on WIBTA is in the wrong for considering leaving their SO who's in prison. The situation is that they've been together 5 years, got engaged, but the SO went to prison for drug-related issues with a 10+ year sentence. The author initially vowed to support him, but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to talk to him anymore, and he's asking for money. The SO's family keeps reminding the author of their support, which adds guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. When someone makes a commitment, especially after a significant event like getting engaged, breaking that commitment can feel like a betrayal. However, relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection. If the author is losing feelings and the relationship is no longer fulfilling, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The SO is in prison, which complicates things because communication is harder, and the dynamic changes.\n\nBut the author made a promise to support him. If they're breaking that promise, that could be seen as wrong. However, people's feelings can change over time, especially under stress and long-term separation. The SO's constant requests for money might be contributing to the strain. Also, the author's mental health and well-being are important. If they're unhappy and the relationship is causing them distress, ending it could be justified.\n\nThe SO's family's comments might be adding pressure, making the author feel guilty even if it's the right decision. Is the author in the wrong for prioritizing their own happiness and future? It's a tough call. On one hand, they made a commitment. On the other, staying in a loveless relationship might not be healthy either. The key factors are the initial vows versus the current reality. \n\nIn such cases, people often face guilt when breaking promises, but if the relationship isn't working anymore, it's not necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid, and relationships require mutual support. Since the SO isn't there to contribute to the relationship anymore, it's reasonable for the author to reassess.\n"
