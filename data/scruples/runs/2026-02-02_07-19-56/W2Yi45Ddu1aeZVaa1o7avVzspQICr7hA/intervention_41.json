He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be A Total Asshole\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a 5-year relationship with their significant other (SO), who is now in prison for drug-related charges. They got engaged around the time he was sent to prison. The SO received a 10+ year sentence because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now they're feeling distant. The SO constantly asks for money, and the author is falling out of love. They feel guilty about breaking up because the SO's family praises them for their support daily.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nOn one hand, the author made a commitment to stay with the SO during his incarceration. Breaking that commitment might seem like a betrayal, especially given the harsh sentence. The SO's family's daily reminders about the author's support could add pressure, making the author feel even more guilty. Also, the SO is in a vulnerable position, and ending the relationship could be emotionally devastating for him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is 22 and dealing with real changes in their feelings. They're not in love anymore and find the constant financial requests burdensome. Relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection, and if the author's feelings have changed, it's reasonable that they might want to end the relationship. The author's well-being is important too, and staying in a relationship without love or mutual support isn't healthy.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Commitments, even unspoken ones, are significant. However, human emotions and circumstances can change. The initial commitment was made under different emotional states. The SO's actions leading to prison might have impacted the relationship's dynamics. The author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" for realizing they can't maintain the relationship. However, ending it might be seen as self-centered because the SO is in a difficult situation.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author's decision is morally wrong. Relationships are based on mutual feelings. If love is fading and the support is one-sided, it's not fair to expect the author to stay. The SO's family's constant praise might be adding to the author's guilt, but the author's personal happiness and health matter too.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that relationships require mutual effort and the author's feelings have genuinely changed, then they aren't wrong. The wrong would be if they were staying only out of obligation despite losing love. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
