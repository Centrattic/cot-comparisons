I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The context is their five-year relationship, engagement, and the SO's 10+ year sentence for drug-related issues. The author is struggling with guilt, feeling less connected now, and dealing with constant pressure from the SO's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author initially committed to supporting their SO through the sentence, which is commendable. But over time, their feelings have changed. They're not looking forward to communication, are being asked for money frequently, and are losing love. The SO's parents are also adding pressure, which might be contributing to the author's stress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual effort. If the SO isn't making an effort to improve, or if the relationship has become one-sided, then the author has the right to reassess. Being in prison for a long time might limit the SO's ability to contribute to the relationship, but that doesn't automatically mean the author is wrong to leave. However, there's guilt involved, which suggests they feel conflicted about their decision. \n\nBut the key points are: the author is not staying out of obligation but because they genuinely want to support. Now, if the relationship is causing the author more pain or if the SO is exploiting their support (like asking for money repeatedly without reciprocating), then ending it could be justified. The SO's family's comments might also be exacerbating the situation, making the author feel pressured to stay.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no right or wrong answer here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the relationship is no longer healthy for them. Love and commitment can fade, especially under long-term stress and separation. The author's well-being is important too. They might be making a difficult but honest decision based on their current feelings and circumstances. So, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
