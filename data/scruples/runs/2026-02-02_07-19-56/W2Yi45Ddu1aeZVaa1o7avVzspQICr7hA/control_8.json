I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're engaged to someone who's in prison for drug-related charges, and the author is considering ending the relationship. The SO was sentenced to over 10 years because he couldn't afford a good lawyer. The author initially promised to support him, but now they're feeling like they can't take it anymore, especially since he's always asking for money and they're falling out of love.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and emotional aspects. When someone makes a commitment, like getting engaged, there's an expectation of loyalty and support. But life can change. The author is 22, so they're still young, and a 10-year prison sentence is a long time. The SO's behavior of asking for money might be putting a strain on the relationship, and the author's feelings are changing. \n\nThe author feels guilty because ending the relationship would hurt the SO and his family. But they also have their own needs and emotional well-being. It's important to recognize that staying in a relationship out of guilt or obligation isn't healthy. The question is whether it's wrong to end it now. \n\nOn one hand, the author made a promise, and breaking that could be seen as a betrayal. On the other hand, people's feelings can change, and it's not necessarily fair to expect someone to stay in a relationship if the love is fading. The SO's actions (drugs leading to prison) might be a reason for the author to reevaluate the relationship. Also, the financial strain and the long-term commitment of a 10-year sentence could be factors that make the relationship unsustainable. \n\nThe author's guilt is valid, but it's also important to consider their own happiness. Ending the relationship isn't just about them; it's about both people's futures. The SO made choices that led to his imprisonment, and the author can't be held responsible for his actions. So, while it's a tough decision, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to leave if they're no longer in love and the relationship is causing them distress. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
