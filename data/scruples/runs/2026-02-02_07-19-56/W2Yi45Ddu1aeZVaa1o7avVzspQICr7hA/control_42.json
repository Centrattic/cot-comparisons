I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their partner who's in prison. The key points here are the relationship duration, the partner's incarceration, the emotional and financial strain, and the opinions of the partner's family.\n\nFirst, the SO is in prison for a 10+ year sentence due to drug-related charges. The writer has been supportive, but now feels distant and is pressured by the partner's family. The SO asks for money constantly, which is a financial burden. The writer is feeling guilty but also losing love.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships require mutual effort. If the SO is in prison, maintaining the relationship is challenging. The writer's feelings have changed, and they're not looking forward to communication anymore. While staying would mean support, it's also important for the writer to be honest about their feelings. The partner's family's comments might add pressure, but the writer's well-being matters too.\n\nFinancial help is optional unless there's a legal obligation. Since it's a personal decision, the writer isn't obligated to keep sending money if it's causing stress. Ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong if the emotional connection is fading. The writer isn't being selfish for considering their own happiness, especially in a long-term commitment that's becoming unsustainable.\n\nHowever, the writer should handle the breakup with care, considering the partner's feelings and the family's reactions. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since relationships require mutual feelings, and the writer is no longer in love, it's not their fault for feeling that way. They made a commitment, but circumstances have changed. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
