I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) who's in prison for drugs. The author is 22, their SO is 25, they've been together five years, got engaged, and then he went to prison for drug-related issues. They supported him initially but now they feel they're falling out of love, he's asking for money, and his family is pressuring them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are commitment, the stress of a long-distance relationship (in this case, a prison relationship), financial strain, emotional changes, and family pressure. \n\nFirst, when someone is in prison, maintaining a relationship is extremely challenging. The author had made a commitment to support their SO, but circumstances have changed. They mention falling out of love, which is a personal feeling and can be a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the SO's family is making them feel guilty, which might be adding pressure.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, is it wrong to end a relationship if one is no longer in love? I think relationships require mutual commitment and emotional connection. If the author is no longer in love, staying might not be healthy for either party. But they also have to consider the emotional impact on the SO and his family, who are already in a difficult situation. \n\nHowever, the SO is in prison for a long time, which adds complexity. The author might have made promises at the time of engagement, but people's feelings can change over time. The SO's behavior of constantly asking for money could also contribute to the author's stress and desire to end the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that staying together shows loyalty and support, even in tough times. But if the author is no longer in love and is being pressured by the family, that guilt might not be a sustainable reason to stay. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. It's their right to reassess their feelings and make decisions about their future. Ending the relationship is a personal choice and doesn't make them an asshole. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
