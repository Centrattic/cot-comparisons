I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (the author) is in a 5-year relationship with their significant other (SO), who is now in prison for drug-related issues and got a 10+ year sentence. The author was initially committed to supporting them but now feels they're falling out of love, the SO keeps asking for money, and the author is considering leaving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The SO is in prison, which is a tough situation for both of them. The author didn't leave immediately but stayed supportive for a while. Now, after some time, they're feeling different. It's important to note that relationships can change over time, especially under such stress. The author is 22 and the SO is 25, so they're both young.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering ending the relationship. On one hand, staying in a relationship without love can be unhealthy. The author might feel trapped by their own previous commitment. On the other hand, the SO is in prison, which is a vulnerable time, and leaving could add emotional pain. The SO's family is pressuring the author, which might be adding to the guilt.\n\nBut the key points here are the author's feelings changing and the SO's constant financial requests. The author might be feeling drained. The fact that they're considering breaking up because they're no longer in love might be a valid reason. However, the guilt from hurting the SO and the family is making it hard for them to decide.\n\nIn terms of morality, relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection. If one person is no longer able to maintain the relationship due to feelings changing, it's not necessarily their fault. But the timing and how they break it off could matter. However, given that the SO is in prison, the author's decision might be seen as breaking a promise made during a more committed time. But people's feelings can evolve, especially under prolonged stress.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because staying in a relationship without love isn't healthy, and the circumstances are challenging. The author is trying to be honest with their feelings, which is important for their own well-being. While it's a tough decision and will hurt the SO, it's not necessarily ass-holish if they handle it with care and honesty.\n"
