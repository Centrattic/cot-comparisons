I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their SO have been together for five years, got engaged, and then he was sent to prison for drug-related charges. He received a 10+ year sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now things have changed. They no longer look forward to speaking with him, he's asking for money constantly, and they're falling out of love. The SO's family is pressuring them by saying how lucky he is to have them. The author feels guilty about potentially breaking up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider factors like commitment, the nature of the relationship, and the circumstances. When they got engaged, they made a commitment, but the SO is in prison, which is a significant life event. The author is now struggling with their feelings and the demands of the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, both partners have responsibilities. The SO's situation might have changed the dynamics. The author might feel that their support is being taken for granted, especially if the SO is asking for money all the time without reciprocating. The emotional strain and loss of love are also factors. \n\nHowever, the author initially promised to stay. Breaking that promise could be seen as a betrayal, but if the relationship is no longer healthy or fulfilling, maybe it's necessary for the author's well-being. The SO's family's comments might add pressure, but that's not the author's fault. \n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they can't be expected to stay in a relationship that's causing them distress and where the feelings have changed. Love can fade, especially under such circumstances. On the other hand, the commitment made before the incarceration might weigh against them. \n\nBut in reality, people do change their minds in relationships, and it's not always about right or wrong. The key is whether the author's decision is selfish or if they're prioritizing their own needs in an unsustainable situation. Since the author is feeling guilty, it might indicate that they're conflicted but not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). They're facing a tough situation where their feelings have changed, and it's reasonable to consider their own happiness and the reality of the relationship.\n"
