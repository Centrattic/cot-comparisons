I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. The situation is that they've been together five years, got engaged, but then he went to prison for drug-related issues with a long sentence. The author initially committed to supporting him, but now feels they're falling out of love, don't want to talk anymore, and he's asking for money. They also mention his family constantly praising her for supporting him, which adds guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong here. Relationships are complex, especially under such circumstances. The key points are the initial commitment versus current feelings. The author isn't necessarily being selfish; they're experiencing emotional changes. Supporting someone in prison is tough, and the dynamic of the relationship might be changing. The person in prison is asking for money, which could be a burden. The author's feelings of guilt are mentioned, but guilt doesn't always equate to being wrong.\n\nFrom a general perspective, staying in a relationship shouldn't be just out of obligation. If the love is fading and the relationship is becoming a source of stress without reciprocal support, maybe ending it isn't the wrong choice. However, cultural or personal values might influence this. Some might argue that commitment means staying, but others would say it's okay to prioritize one's own well-being.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), that would mean it's understandable to end the relationship given the circumstances. If A, then they should stay. Considering the factors: the initial commitment was made before the prison sentence, and now the situation is changing. The person in prison isn't necessarily being a bad partner, but the relationship's viability is in question. The author's feelings are valid. So, I think the answer is B. They're not in the wrong because they're reevaluating their feelings and circumstances.\n"
