I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. The SO got a 10+ year sentence due to drug involvement and can't afford a good lawyer. The author has been supportive but now feels distant, the SO is asking for money constantly, and they're losing feelings. The SO's family keeps reminding them how lucky the SO is to have them. The author feels guilty about breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. So, when you're in a committed relationship, like engaged, and your partner is incarcerated, the dynamics change a lot. The author has been with the SO for 5 years, so it's a significant relationship. The SO is in prison for 10+ years, which is a long time. The author initially committed to supporting them, but now things are changing. \n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings, the SO's behavior (asking for money all the time), and the family's pressure. The author is feeling guilty, which might indicate they're struggling with their decision. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, people can change. The author might be realizing that their feelings are fading, which is a personal realization. The SO's constant requests for money could be causing strain, and the author might not be able to sustain that financially or emotionally. The fact that the SO can't afford a good lawyer suggests that the legal situation was already precarious, leading to a harsh sentence. \n\nThe author's decision to leave could be seen as breaking a promise, but relationships also require mutual effort and compatibility. If the author is losing feelings and the relationship is becoming burdensome, maybe it's a matter of self-preservation. However, breaking up while the partner is in prison and then during engagement might be seen as abandoning them. \n\nBut considering that the author is still young (22) and the SO is 25, they're in their early 20s, a time when people can change and grow. The author might not be in the wrong if they feel the relationship is no longer healthy or sustainable. The guilt they're feeling is natural because they did commit to supporting them, but if the relationship is causing more distress than support, it's a tough call. \n\nAlso, the family's constant reminders about the SO's luck could add pressure on the author, but they're making their own decision. The core issue is the author's emotional state and whether staying in the relationship is healthy for them. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being and realizing the relationship might not be working anymore. It's a difficult decision, but it's their right to choose their future happiness.\n"
