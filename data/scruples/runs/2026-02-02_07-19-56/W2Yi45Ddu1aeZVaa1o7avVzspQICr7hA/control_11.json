He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him.

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the WIBTA (Would I Be A Twat For Asking) scenario is in the wrong if they leave their significant other while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together for 5 years, engaged, but the SO is in prison for 10+ years due to drug involvement. The person initially wanted to support him, but now they're feeling distant, he's asking for money, and they might be falling out of love. The SO's family is pressuring the person, saying how lucky he is to have them. The person is conflicted and guilty about ending the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the factors. In a long-term relationship, especially when one partner is incarcerated, maintaining the relationship requires a lot of emotional support and commitment. The author initially committed to being there, which is commendable. However, over time, their feelings have changed. They're no longer looking forward to conversations, are being asked for money frequently, and are possibly losing love. \n\nEmotional changes are a valid reason for ending a relationship. But since the SO is in prison, it's more challenging. The author might be feeling the strain of the long-distance and the stress of the situation. The guilt comes from breaking a promise made during a difficult time. However, people's feelings can evolve, and staying in a relationship without love might not be healthy for the author.\n\nThe SO's family's comments might be adding pressure, but the author's own well-being is important. Ending the relationship isn't necessarily inconsiderate if the feelings have genuinely changed. It's a tough situation, but the author isn't obligated to stay just out of obligation. They might be wrong in the eyes of the family, but in terms of personal choice and emotional health, it's a complex decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong). They're making a personal decision based on their feelings and circumstances, even if it's hard.\n"
