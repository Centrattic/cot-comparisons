I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. The author has been in a five-year relationship, got engaged, and then the SO was sent to prison for drug-related issues. The author initially committed to supporting him but now feels differently due to constant requests for money and emotional changes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The SO has a 10+ year sentence, so the relationship is long-term in a difficult situation. The author is young (22) and the SO is 25. They were close to family, which is now a source of pressure with daily reminders. The author feels guilty but also emotionally distant.\n\nThe key points here are commitment, changing feelings, and the impact of the prison sentence. When people get engaged, they enter into a long-term commitment. However, circumstances change, and maintaining a relationship under such stress is tough. The author initially promised support, but now feels they might be falling out of love. That's a personal struggle. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for breaking up if they're not in love anymore? Relationships require mutual effort and emotional connection. If the feelings have changed, can the author be blamed for reevaluating? On the other hand, breaking up after a promise could be seen as a betrayal, especially given the circumstances. The SO is in prison, and ending the relationship might add to his emotional burden. The family's pressure also plays a role here.\n\nBut the author is struggling with their own emotions. They might feel trapped by the commitment made before the incarceration. It's important to differentiate between initial commitment and ongoing emotional investment. If the love has faded, is it fair to stay in a relationship out of guilt or obligation? \n\nSocially, there might be expectations to stay, but personal well-being is also important. The author might be prioritizing their own mental health, which is valid. However, the SO might feel abandoned, which could be hurtful. \n\nIn terms of morality, there's no clear right or wrong. But considering the scenario, the author is not in the wrong for reevaluating their feelings. The relationship's foundation is love, and if that's missing, the author isn't at fault for seeking their own happiness. The SO's family's constant reminders might also be adding pressure on the author, influencing their decision. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're dealing with real emotional changes and the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship under such difficult circumstances. The commitment made was under different circumstances (before the prison sentence), and people can change their feelings over time.\n"
