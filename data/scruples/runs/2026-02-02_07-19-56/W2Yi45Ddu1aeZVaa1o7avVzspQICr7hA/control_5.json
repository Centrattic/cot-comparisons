I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other (SO) while he's in prison. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been together for five years, got engaged, and then the SO went to prison for drug-related issues with a 10+ year sentence. The person in the question (the author) initially vowed to support them but now feels they're falling out of love, the SO is asking for money constantly, and they're no longer looking forward to talking. The SO's family is pressuring the author, making them feel guilty.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to leave. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about the factors here. \n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, love and commitment are key. When a relationship is based on mutual respect and affection, leaving because feelings have changed isn't necessarily wrong. The author has been supportive initially, which is commendable. However, the situation has evolved. The SO's constant financial requests might be a strain, and the emotional distance could be a valid reason to reassess the relationship. \n\nBut the author is also feeling guilt from the SO's family. They might be under pressure to stay, but that doesn't mean they have to. People have the right to their own happiness. The SO is in a difficult situation, but that doesn't obligate the author to remain in a relationship that's causing them emotional distress. \n\nIt's important to consider the well-being of both parties. If the author is losing their love and not looking forward to the relationship, staying might not be healthy for them. The SO's actions (drugs leading to prison) already caused a rift, and the ongoing stress might be straining the relationship further. \n\nOn the other hand, leaving could be hurtful for the SO and his family. But is that a reason to stay? The author isn't at fault for changing feelings. They can still choose to be respectful and compassionate in ending things, perhaps providing support even after the breakup if possible. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their own emotional health. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
