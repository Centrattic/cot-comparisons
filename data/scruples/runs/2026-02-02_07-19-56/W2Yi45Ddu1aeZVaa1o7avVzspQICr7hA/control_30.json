I am now 22 and he\u2019s 25. \n\nWe got engaged last year. Around the same time, he got sent to prison for getting involved with drugs. He can\u2019t afford a good lawyer, so his sentence ended up to be 10+ years. I was devastated but I knew that I wanted to support him. I told him that I\u2019m going to be there for him no matter what and I\u2019m not going anywhere\n\nThings are changing now. I don\u2019t look forward to speaking to him anymore, he asks for money all the time and I think I may be falling out of love with him. I\u2019m close with his family, and his parents let me know almost daily how lucky he is that he has me. I know it\u2019s going to hurt him and them if I break up with him. I feel extremely guilty about this \n\nWould I be an asshole if I end things with my SO? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for considering leaving their significant other while he's in prison. The SO got a 10+ year sentence for drug-related issues, and the author has been supporting him but now feels overwhelmed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were engaged for a year before the incarceration. The SO can't afford a good lawyer, which might mean he made a bad decision due to financial constraints. The author initially wanted to support him, which shows commitment. However, now she's feeling like she's falling out of love, and he's constantly asking for money. She's close with his family, who pressure her, making her feel guilty.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, relationships require mutual support, but that doesn't mean one person can't leave, especially under such circumstances. Prison can strain relationships because of the physical separation and the stress involved. The SO's constant requests for money might be adding to the stress, and if she's losing feelings, that's a personal issue she needs to address. While breaking up might hurt him and his family, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship that's becoming unhealthy for her. It's her right to prioritize her own well-being. However, she should handle it with care to minimize hurt. So, she's not in the wrong for ending it, but needs to be considerate in her approach.\n"
