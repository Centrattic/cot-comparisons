I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who writes the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. The scenario involves the person buying items from thrift stores like Goodwill and reselling them on eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, when you buy something from a thrift store, you purchase it from the store, not directly from the donor. The store sells items to raise funds, so reselling those items isn't inherently illegal. However, there might be terms of service or store policies that prohibit reselling. If that's the case, the person might be violating those policies.\n\nEthically, thrift stores rely on donations to support their missions, which often include helping the less fortunate. If someone is flipping items for profit, some might argue that it's taking advantage of the system meant to help others. On the other hand, the person isn't taking directly from donors; they're buying from a store that sells items for a cause. The argument there is that the store benefits from the sale, and the person is just capitalizing on the opportunity to resell, which is a common practice in many markets.\n\nThe store employee's reaction is also a point to consider. The cashier told the person to leave and banned them. The store might have specific rules against reselling, which the person didn't know or agreed to when purchasing. If the store's policy prohibits reselling, then the person might be in the wrong for not following those terms. However, if there's no such policy, the store's action could be excessive.\n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. The woman who confronted the person accused them of stealing from the less fortunate, which is a strong claim. The person is buying secondhand items, not new or donated goods directly. The store's mission is to provide affordable goods and support their charitable work. Reselling could be seen as undermining that mission if it reduces the availability of items for those who need them, but in reality, the store is selling to raise funds, and the person's purchase is just one transaction among many.\n\nIn summary, the key points are: legality (no clear violation unless store policy prohibits it), ethics (conflicting views on exploiting charitable systems vs. using market opportunities), and the store's policies. If there's no explicit policy against reselling, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the store has such a policy, they might be violating it. The answer hinges on whether the store's terms include a ban on reselling, which isn't mentioned here. Since the person didn't know about such a policy and the store's reaction seems harsh, the answer might lean towards the person not being in the wrong.\n"
