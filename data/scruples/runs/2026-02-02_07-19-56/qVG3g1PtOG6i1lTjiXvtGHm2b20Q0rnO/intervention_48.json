I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. They mention they keep their eBay activity a secret to avoid higher prices. At Goodwill, a woman confronts them, accuses them of being a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" and the cashier then bans them and threatens to call the police.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether reselling thrift store items is unethical or violates any rules. Thrift stores typically sell donated goods, so the items are meant to be sold at lower prices to fund the store's operations. If someone buys these items solely to resell them for profit, that could be seen as taking advantage of the system. \n\nHowever, thrift stores don't usually have policies against customers reselling items. Unless the author is buying in bulk or violating store rules, it's a personal choice. The cashier's reaction might have been overzealous. The author isn't stealing; they're purchasing items and reselling them. The woman's argument that they're taking from the less fortunate is a bit flawed because the items were already sold, just at a discount. The key point is whether the author's action is against the store's terms. Since there's no mention of a policy prohibiting this, the author might not be in the wrong. But some might argue it's exploiting the system. The answer might hinge on whether the store allows such practices. If they don't, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the store's policies, but if there's no policy, then maybe not. The cashier's threat seems harsh. So, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's a gray area. However, the author isn't stealing; they're following the store's rules as presented. The real issue might be the cashier's overreaction, not the author's actions. So, the answer is B.\n"
