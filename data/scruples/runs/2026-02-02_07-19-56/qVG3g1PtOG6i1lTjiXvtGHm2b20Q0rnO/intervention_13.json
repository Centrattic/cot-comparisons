I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The writer got caught and was banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of thrift stores. Most thrift stores operate on the premise that donated items are for sale at low prices to make them affordable to everyone. If someone is buying these items to resell at a higher price, that might be against their policies. Thrift stores often rely on items being sold to individuals who need them, not to be resold for profit. Some stores might explicitly prohibit bulk buying or reselling to prevent people from exploiting the system.\n\nThe woman in the story admitted to flipping items, which could be against Goodwill's rules. The cashier then banned her, which is within the store's rights if reselling is prohibited. The woman might be in the wrong because she violated the store's policies by trying to resell items instead of using them as intended. \n\nHowever, some might argue that buying secondhand items and reselling them isn't inherently wrong, but it depends on the store's specific rules. Since the woman was told to leave and not return, the store took action based on their policies, suggesting that she was indeed in violation. \n\nI think the key point here is whether the thrift store explicitly prohibits reselling. If they do, then the woman is in the wrong. If not, maybe not. However, given that the cashier banned her, it's likely that reselling is against their policy. So the answer is A.\n"
