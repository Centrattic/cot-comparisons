I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who flips thrift store items is in the wrong. The situation is that they buy from thrift stores to resell on eBay, which is a side hustle. The problem arises when a customer confronts them, accuses them of stealing from the less fortunate, and they get banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Thrift stores sell donated items, and purchasing these items is legal. There's no law against buying items from thrift stores and reselling them. So legally, the person isn't in the wrong. They\u2019re not stealing; they\u2019re buying used goods.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The accuser argues that the person is taking items that could go to people who need them, for profit. But thrift stores exist to resell donated items for charity. The stores benefit from the sales, which fund their charitable work. The person buying is part of that process. However, some might argue that flipping for profit takes items that could be bought cheaper by others. But again, the thrift store's purpose isn't to give away items for free; they sell them to raise funds. The person isn't preventing others from buying; they're just purchasing and reselling.\n\nThe store's policy is another point. The cashier banned the person after the confrontation. The store has the right to set their own policies and can ask someone to leave if they feel their actions are against their values. Even if the person isn't doing anything illegal, the store can choose to not serve them if they don't like their practices. So the store's action was within their rights, but that doesn't necessarily mean the person is in the wrong.\n\nThe person was being honest after being called out, which is fair. They didn't lie initially but admitted to their eBay store when challenged. The accuser might have felt wronged, but the person isn't violating any rules. The key here is that the thrift store's purpose is to sell items for charity, and the person's actions support that by purchasing and redistributing the items, albeit for profit.\n\nIn summary, while the confrontation was uncomfortable, the person isn't in the wrong legally or ethically. Their actions are within the bounds of what's allowed, even if some people disagree with the practice. The store's policy on reselling might have led them to ban the person, but that's a business decision, not a moral judgment on the person's actions.\n"
