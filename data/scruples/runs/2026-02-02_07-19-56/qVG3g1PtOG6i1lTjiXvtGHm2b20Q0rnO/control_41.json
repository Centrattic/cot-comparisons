I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author goes to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buys items, and sells them on eBay. They mention it's a hobby that generates some extra income. The key points here are that they're buying secondhand items and reselling them for profit. Now, the ethical question is whether this practice is wrong.\n\nThrift stores typically sell donated goods. The author keeps their eBay activity a secret from the store workers because they've had prices increased once the workers found out. That suggests there might be a policy against reselling items from the store. The woman who confronted the author was upset, calling them a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper,\" implying that by buying and reselling, they're taking advantage of donated goods meant for people in need. \n\nThe cashier then banned the author from the store. The ethical dilemma here is about fairness and the purpose of thrift stores. Thrift stores exist to provide affordable goods and to recycle donations. If someone is buying these items to resell at higher prices, it could be seen as undermining that purpose. However, thrift stores are also businesses that sell secondhand goods, so it's a public market. There's no law against buying from one seller and reselling to another, so legally the author isn't doing anything wrong. \n\nBut ethically, the argument is whether the author is exploiting a system designed to help those in need. The woman's argument is that by buying these items, the author is taking them away from people who might need them and profiting. However, others might argue that the items are already sold by the thrift store, so the author is just participating in the market like any other buyer. \n\nThe cashier's action of banning the author is a store policy, not a legal one. So, the author isn't in legal wrong, but maybe ethically, depending on perspective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author agreed to any restrictions by purchasing the items. Since the author didn't disclose their eBay activity and the store might have a policy against it, even if not stated, the store can enforce their rules. \n\nBut ethically, the community might have mixed views. Some might support the author for using a legal loophole, others might think it's exploiting the system. However, since the author is not breaking any laws, and the store's policy is their own, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
