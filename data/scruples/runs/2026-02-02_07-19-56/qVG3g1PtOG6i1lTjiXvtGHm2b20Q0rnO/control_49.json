I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. The situation involves buying items like Ralph Lauren shirts to resell on eBay. The key points here are the ethics of reselling thrift store items and whether the author overstepped.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. Thrift stores like Goodwill usually sell donated items, and while they don't explicitly prohibit reselling, their mission is to provide affordable goods to the community. If someone buys items to resell for profit, does that contradict the store's purpose? Maybe, but it's not illegal. However, the author kept their intentions secret to avoid higher prices, which might be seen as deceptive.\n\nThen there's the customer interaction. The woman confronted the author, accusing them of stealing from the less fortunate. The author didn't lie but used a cover story initially. When caught, they admitted to selling on eBay. The cashier then banned them, which could be based on store policy. The author's actions might be considered unethical by some if they're taking advantage of the system meant for lower-income people. \n\nLegally, there's no law against buying and reselling items, even if they're secondhand. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't stealing; they're purchasing items at market price. However, the perception is that they're exploiting a system where others might need the items more. The cashier's decision to ban them could be based on their own interpretation of the store's mission, even if it's not explicitly stated in policy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. Legally, no. Ethically, it's debatable. The store didn't have a clear policy against it, but the author's secrecy and the customer's reaction suggest a conflict. The cashier acted on the accusation, which might be harsh, but the author might not have done anything wrong beyond what's permitted. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) but with some nuances about ethics versus legality.\n"
