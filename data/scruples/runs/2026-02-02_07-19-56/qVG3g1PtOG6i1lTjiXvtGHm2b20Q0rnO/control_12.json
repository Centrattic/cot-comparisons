I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who flips thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The situation involves being confronted by a customer and then banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the thrift stores. Thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army rely on donations. Their mission is to provide affordable goods to the community. If the store allows individuals to buy items and resell them, then technically, the person isn't breaking any laws. However, the store might have their own policies against this. The user mentioned that previously, store owners raised prices when they knew about the flipping, which implies there might be some informal policies or tensions here.\n\nThe woman who confronted the user called her a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" which are terms usually associated with reselling items for profit, sometimes in contexts like concerts or events. But in the context of thrift stores, flipping isn't illegal, just a business practice. However, the cashier banned her, which suggests the store might have a policy against it. If the store allows it, then the user isn't in the wrong. If they don't, then maybe she violated their rules. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which can be both legal and ethical.\n\nEthically, some people might argue that flipping thrift items takes advantage of donated goods meant for lower-income individuals. Others might say it's a legitimate business as long as it's within the store's rules. The user tried to keep it secret to avoid higher prices, which shows she's aware that some people might disapprove. The cashier banned her, but if the store doesn't explicitly prohibit reselling, then the user isn't in the wrong. If they do have a policy against it, she violated that policy. However, the question is whether she's morally wrong, not just breaking store rules.\n\nIn most cases, thrift stores don't prohibit reselling unless they specify. So legally and in terms of store policy, it's a gray area. Ethically, it's a matter of opinion. The answer depends on whether the store allows it. Since the user was banned, maybe the store doesn't approve, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's in the wrong. The key point is that reselling thrift store items isn't illegal, and unless there's a specific policy against it, the user isn't wrong. The cashier's actions might be an overreaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
