I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about reselling items bought from thrift stores on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Thrift stores rely on donations to support their charitable missions, like helping the less fortunate. If someone is buying items from these stores with the sole purpose of reselling them for profit, is that unethical? Well, technically, the stores sell items at their own prices, so if someone buys an item at a low price and sells it for a higher one, that's not illegal. But ethically, it might be a gray area.\n\nThe store employees might see this as taking advantage of the system. The author mentions that once people know they're a \"flipper,\" the prices go up. That's a practical issue for the author, but does that make their actions wrong? If the author is just buying items as a customer, they're not violating any laws. However, the employees might feel that the author is undermining the store's purpose, which is to provide affordable items to the community.\n\nThe woman who confronted the author accused her of \"stealing from the less fortunate.\" While the author isn't literally stealing, the perception is that they're profiting from goods that were donated for a charitable cause. This could be seen as exploiting the system, even if it's not illegal. The cashier then banned the author, which might be a policy decision by the store to protect their mission.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, probably not. But ethically, there's a strong argument that they are. The author is using a system intended to help others for personal gain, which could be considered unethical. However, the author isn't harming anyone directly, as they're just purchasing items that the store is selling. It's a bit of a moral dilemma. The answer depends on whether one prioritizes the letter of the law or the spirit of the store's mission."
