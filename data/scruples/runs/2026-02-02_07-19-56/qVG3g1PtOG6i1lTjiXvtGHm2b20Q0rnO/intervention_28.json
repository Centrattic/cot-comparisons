I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The user is a \"thrifter\" who buys stuff from places like Goodwill and Salvation Army, not for personal use but to sell for profit. They tried to hide their eBay activity from the store employees, but a customer found out and confronted them, leading to being banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms and policies of Goodwill and similar thrift stores. As far as I know, thrift stores are non-profits that rely on donations. When you buy items there, you're purchasing them from the store, not directly from the donors. So the store has the right to sell those items. However, some stores might have rules against reselling items for profit. The user mentioned that an owner once raised prices on them after finding out they were reselling, implying that the store might have an implicit policy against this. But is there an explicit rule against it?\n\nIn many cases, thrift stores don't have a policy prohibiting customers from reselling items they've purchased. The items become the buyer's property once paid for, so they can do with them as they please. However, some might argue that the purpose of thrift stores is to provide affordable goods to the community, and reselling could be seen as exploiting that system for personal gain. But legally, unless there's a specific clause in the store's terms of sale, the buyer isn't in the wrong.\n\nThe cashier banned the user from the store. That's their prerogative as the store can set their own policies. But if there's no official policy against reselling, the user isn't breaking any rules. The cashier's reaction might be based on personal morals rather than store policy. The user didn't steal or deceive; they bought items legally and resold them, which is a legal practice unless prohibited by the store.\n\nThe user also tried to hide their eBay activity, which could be seen as deceptive. However, the store didn't explicitly state that reselling is forbidden, so the user might not have known that. The cashier's decision to ban them is within their rights but doesn't necessarily make the user wrong unless there's a rule they violated.\n\nIn terms of ethics, opinions might differ. Some might see it as a legitimate way to make money, while others might think it's unfair to the original donors. But legally and based on standard store policies, the user isn't in the wrong. The cashier overstepped if there's no official policy against reselling. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
