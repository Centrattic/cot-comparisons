I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person is a thrifter who buys items from stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army to resell on eBay. They mention that they keep it a secret from the store workers because once they found out, prices went up for them. Then, a woman confronted them, called them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" and made a scene. The cashier then banned them from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and legality here. Thrift stores sell donated items. If someone buys these items and resells them, is that allowed? Legally, once an item is sold by the store, the buyer owns it and can do with it as they please, right? So reselling is legal. However, the ethical angle is trickier. The woman's argument is that by reselling, the person is taking from the \"less fortunate\" since the items were donated by people who might need the money. But thrift stores operate on the premise that when you donate an item, the store sells it to raise funds for their cause. So the store is the one benefiting from the sale, not the original donor. The reseller is just a third party purchasing an already sold item. \n\nBut the cashier banned the person, which raises the question of whether the store can enforce such a policy. If the store's policy is against reselling, they might have the right to prohibit it. However, if there's no such policy, banning someone just for reselling could be seen as an overreach. The user mentions that they had previously kept their reselling a secret because workers raised prices when they found out. That suggests that the store might not have an official policy against reselling, just some workers trying to protect their own sales.\n\nThe woman's claim that the reseller is \"stealing from the less fortunate\" is a bit of a stretch. The reseller isn't taking donations directly; they're purchasing items that the store has already sold. The store's role here is to sell donated items to the public, so the reseller is just another customer. However, if the store has a policy against reselling, then the reseller is violating that policy. But if there's no such policy, the store can't really enforce a ban based on reselling alone.\n\nEthically, some might argue that reselling thrifted items is exploiting the system, especially if the items are high-end and the reseller is making a profit. But others would say it's a legitimate business practice. The woman's anger might stem from a belief that thrift stores are for people in need, not for profit. However, thrift stores often have a mission to provide affordable items, but they also benefit from the sales. The reseller's actions don't directly harm the store's mission unless the reseller is undercutting their prices, but since the reseller is buying from the store, they're not affecting the store's sales directly.\n\nIn terms of the story, the cashier banned the reseller, which could be seen as unfair if there's no policy against it. The store's policy might not allow reselling, but if that's not clearly stated, the ban might be unjust. However, the cashier might feel that allowing reselling reduces the number of items available for local customers or lowers the store's profits. But legally, the store can't just prohibit reselling unless it's in their policy. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the reseller is in the right because they bought items legally and can resell them. Ethically, it's debatable, but no one is necessarily in the wrong. The store's ban might be an overreaction if there's no policy against reselling. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
