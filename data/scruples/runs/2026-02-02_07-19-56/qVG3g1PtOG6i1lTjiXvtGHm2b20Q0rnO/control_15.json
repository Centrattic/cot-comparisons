I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to check if reselling thrift store items is allowed. Thrift stores sell second-hand goods, and when you buy an item from them, you own it. The original owners donated the items, so the thrift store has the right to sell them. Reselling those items is a common practice, like buying something second-hand and flipping it for profit. That's legal unless there's a specific policy against it.\n\nThe user mentioned they keep their eBay activity secret because some stores raised prices once they found out. But the key point is whether the thrift store's terms prohibit resale. If there's no such policy, the person isn't in the wrong. The woman's accusation that they're \"stealing from the less fortunate\" is a bit off because the items are already sold by the thrift store. The cashier banning them without a policy might be overstepping. \n\nHowever, maybe the store had a rule against reselling and the person wasn't aware. But generally, unless the store explicitly states that items can't be resold, it's their right to do so. The person isn't violating any laws. The cashier's reaction might be based on a misunderstanding or the store's own policy, but if there's no official rule, the author isn't at fault. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They bought items legally and have the right to resell them. The store's reaction seems unwarranted unless there's a specific policy, which wasn't mentioned here.\n"
