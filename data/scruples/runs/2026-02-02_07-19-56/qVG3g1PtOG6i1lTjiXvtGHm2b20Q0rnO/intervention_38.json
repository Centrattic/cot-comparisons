I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sells thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores to resell, which the author mentions is a hobby and a way to make extra money. The conflict arises when a customer confronts them, calling them a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper,\" leading to being banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and legality here. Thrift stores sell donated goods, and buying items from there is allowed. Reselling those items isn't inherently illegal. However, the key point is whether the author is violating any store policies. The author mentions they try to keep their reselling a secret because they've had instances where stores raised prices once they knew. This suggests that the stores might have a policy against people buying items specifically to resell, which could be considered a form of arbitrage. If the store has such a policy and the author is aware (maybe not explicitly stated), then violating it could be against the store's rules. \n\nBut from a legal standpoint, unless there's a specific law against reselling secondhand goods, the author isn't breaking the law. Ethically, some might argue that reselling donated items is taking advantage of the charity's mission, which is to provide affordable goods to those in need. However, others might say that the items are already being sold at a lower price, and the author is just participating in the market. \n\nThe woman's accusation that the author is \"stealing from the less fortunate\" is a bit strong. The items were donated, so the author isn't stealing. The store sells them, and the author is purchasing them legally. The store might not like people reselling, but unless there's a policy in place, it's not illegal.\n\nThe cashier banned the author based on the customer's claims. If the store's policy explicitly prohibits reselling, then the author is violating that policy. However, if the policy isn't written or communicated, the ban might be unfair. The author might have an issue with the store's enforcement of their rules.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they didn't break any laws. However, if the store's policy is against reselling and they were aware of it, then they might be violating the store's rules. Since the author mentions keeping their purpose secret, it's possible they knew the store might disapprove, but not necessarily that it's against the law.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the store's rules were violated. If the store's policy prohibits reselling and the author knew or should have known, then they might be in the wrong. But if there's no such policy, they aren't. Since the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong in general, considering the scenario, the answer is more nuanced. However, the cashier did ban them based on the customer's claims, which might be an overreaction if the store doesn't have a clear policy. But the author isn't violating the law, so the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
