I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who writes the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The scenario is about buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The person got caught and was banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, thrift stores sell items they have purchased or received through donations. When you buy something from a thrift store, you own it, right? So reselling it shouldn't be illegal. However, there might be store policies against this. The cashier told the person to leave and banned them, which suggests that the store has a policy against flipping items. So maybe the person violated the store's terms, even if it's legal.\n\nEthically, some might argue that thrift stores exist to help communities by providing affordable goods and giving second chances to donated items. If someone is buying these items solely to resell at higher prices, it could be seen as exploiting the system. The woman who confronted the person argued that they're taking items from those in need, which is a common ethical concern. On the other hand, the person is making a small income from their hobby, which is their right once they've legally purchased the items.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The key points here are the store's policy, the intent behind thrifting, and the ethical implications. Legally, the person isn't necessarily wrong, but ethically, it's debatable. The store's policy is clear, so the person violated that, leading to being banned. However, the store can't call the police unless there's a law being broken, which might not be the case here. \n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the action is legal (no, the person isn't wrong) versus ethical (maybe yes). Since the question is about being in the wrong, which includes both legal and social norms, the store's policy is a social norm. But the person didn't break the law. However, the woman who confronted them is also being judgmental, which might not be right either. The cashier enforced the store's policy, which is their right, but the person was banned for violating that policy. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because legally they did nothing wrong, even though they violated the store's policy. The store can enforce their own rules, but that doesn't make the person morally wrong. However, some might argue it's unethical. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which implies wrongdoing, and since there's no legal wrongdoing, it's more of a policy issue.\n"
