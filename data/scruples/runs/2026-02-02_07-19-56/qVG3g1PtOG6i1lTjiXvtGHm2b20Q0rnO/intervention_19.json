I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person goes to thrift stores, buys items to resell on eBay. The woman they encountered confronted them, leading to being banned from the store.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main points to consider are the store's policies and the ethical implications. \n\nThrift stores typically sell donated items to raise funds for their causes, like charity. If the store doesn't have a policy against reselling, then the author isn't technically breaking any rules. However, if the store feels that the customer is exploiting their goods by flipping them for profit, that's a different angle. \n\nIn the scenario, the author tried to hide their eBay activity to avoid higher prices. The store employee banned them after the confrontation. Legally, if the store doesn't prohibit reselling, the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, some might argue it's unfair since the items were donated to help others. But others might say it's just a business and the customer is using the market as it is.\n\nThe store's right to ban anyone is part of their policy. The author's actions, while perhaps ethically debatable, aren't illegal unless the store explicitly forbids it. Since the store owner decided to ban them, but the author isn't violating any laws, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
