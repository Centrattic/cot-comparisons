I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about someone buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The main question is whether that's acceptable or not.\n\nFirst, thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army sell donated items. Their primary purpose is to provide affordable goods to the community, and the proceeds go towards their charitable causes. Now, the person in question is buying these items not for personal use but to resell for profit. The store staff and another customer are upset because they feel this is taking advantage of the system meant to help others.\n\nBut legally, if you buy something from a retail store, you own it and can do with it what you want, including reselling. The stores sell their items to the public, so there's no explicit rule against reselling. However, some stores might have policies against this, and if they find out, they might restrict you, like the cashier did here. So the legal side might be on the person's side, but there's an ethical question.\n\nEthically, some might argue that thrift stores are meant to help people who can't afford new items, so reselling could take away opportunities for others to buy them cheaply. Others might say that the stores are selling the items, so if someone is willing to buy them and resell at a higher price, it's still a free market transaction. The other customer's anger is more about the intent to profit versus the store's purpose, but if the store allows the purchase, the customer's action is within their rights.\n\nThe cashier banning the person for life and threatening police involvement seems excessive unless there's a specific store policy against reselling. If there's no such policy, that action might be unwarranted. But if the store has a rule that buyers can't resell items, then the person violated that. The story mentions that the person was previously raised prices on by stores once they knew, so maybe some stores don't like it, but it's not illegal.\n\nIn summary, the person might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's a gray area. The store staff's reaction might be based on their own policies or ethical stance, but unless there's a clear rule against reselling, the person isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B, No.\n"
