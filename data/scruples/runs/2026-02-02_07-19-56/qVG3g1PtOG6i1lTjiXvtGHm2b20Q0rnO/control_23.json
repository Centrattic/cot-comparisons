I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The writer gets confronted by a customer and then banned by the store. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, when you buy something from a thrift store, you own it, right? So reselling it shouldn't be illegal. Thrift stores sell donated goods, so once you purchase an item, it's yours to do with as you like. But maybe there's an ethical angle here. Some people might argue that thrift stores exist to help those in need, and flipping items for profit takes away from that purpose. However, others might say that the store makes money from selling to the public, and individuals can resell as they see fit.\n\nThe woman who confronted the author called her a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper,\" which are terms usually associated with reselling tickets or event items. But in this case, it's clothing. The store's policy might be an issue here. If the store doesn't allow reselling, then the author could be violating store rules. However, the author mentions that she tries to keep her activity a secret to avoid higher prices, implying that the store doesn't explicitly ban reselling. \n\nThe store owner cashier banned her, threatening police if she returns. Legally, can a store owner ban someone for reselling? Yes, they can set their own policies. But is that justified? It's a bit of a gray area. The store might feel that their donated items shouldn't be resold for profit, but legally, as long as the items are sold in good faith, the customer has the right to resell. \n\nEthically, some people might feel it's wrong because donated items are meant to be affordable for others. However, the author isn't taking items directly from donors but purchasing them from the store. The store gets its revenue from the sale, so the author's resale doesn't directly affect the store's income. \n\nThe key points here are legality vs. ethics and store policy. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong because once an item is purchased, it's the buyer's to use as they see fit. Ethically, it's debatable. The store's stance might be based on a moral belief rather than a legal requirement. The cashier's action of banning the author is within their rights as a store policy, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for reselling. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the question is about legal wrongdoing or moral judgment. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which often includes both, but the main point here is that the author isn't breaking any laws, and while ethically there's a debate, legally she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
