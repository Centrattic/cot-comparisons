I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author buys items from thrift stores (like Goodwill) and resells them on eBay. They keep it a secret from store workers to avoid price hikes. Then, a customer confronts them, accuses them of being a \"flipper\" or \"scalper,\" and the cashier bans them from the store, even threatening to call the police if they return.\n\nThe key points here are legality and ethical considerations. Legally, if the author is purchasing items at face value from the store, they own them and can resell as they wish. Thrift stores sell items that have been donated, so once the store sells it, the buyer has the right to resell. However, the ethical angle is different. The accuser argues that the author is taking items from the \"less fortunate,\" implying that by reselling, they're depriving someone else of a chance to buy it cheaper. But thrift stores are for-profit entities; they sell donated items to raise money, which they then use for their charitable work. So the author's resale doesn't directly impact the original donors. \n\nHowever, the cashier banning the author might be based on store policy. If the store has a rule against bulk buying or reselling, then the author could be in violation. But if there's no such policy, the cashier's action might be overstepping. The author wasn't stealing; they were purchasing legally. The cashier's threat to call the police if they return seems extreme unless there's a specific rule against reselling. \n\nEthically, some might argue that the author is exploiting a system meant to help others, but legally, there's no wrongdoing. The cashier's actions might be problematic if they're enforcing a policy that doesn't exist. The author's actions are within the law, so they're not in the wrong there. The cashier's response might be more questionable if it's not based on actual store rules. \n\nSo the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are legal, and the cashier's response might be excessive unless there's a specific policy against reselling.\n"
