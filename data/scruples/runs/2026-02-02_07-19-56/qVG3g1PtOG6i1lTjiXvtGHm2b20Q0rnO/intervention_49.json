I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The person got confronted by a woman and then banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of service of the thrift store. Many thrift stores operate on a non-profit basis, relying on donations to fund their charitable work. If the store's policy prohibits reselling items purchased there, then the person might be violating that policy. But if there's no such policy, then it's allowed.\n\nThe person mentioned they keep their eBay activity a secret to avoid prices being raised. That suggests that the stores aren't aware they're doing this, which might be a problem. But the ethical angle is whether it's right to resell donated goods. Donated items are meant to be affordable for others in need. If someone is buying these items to resell at higher prices, it could be seen as exploiting the system meant to help lower-income individuals.\n\nHowever, thrift stores do sell items to the public, so technically, anyone can buy them. There's no legal prohibition against reselling purchased items, right? But ethically, if the purpose of the store is to provide affordable goods, reselling for profit might undermine that purpose. The woman's argument is that the items are taken from people who donated them, possibly because they couldn't afford them, and then the person is profiting from that.\n\nThe cashier banned the person, but unless there's a policy against it, the store might not have the legal right to do that. But they might have their own rules. The person is in a gray area\u2014legally they might be allowed, but ethically questionable. The author's actions could be seen as wrong because they're using a charitable system for personal profit, potentially limiting access for those who need the items at low cost. So, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because the ethics of exploiting the thrift store's model for profit is questionable, even if it's not illegal.\n"
