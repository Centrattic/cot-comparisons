I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who flips thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The story says they buy items from thrift stores and resell them for profit. The key points here are the ethics of reselling donated goods and the specific actions taken by the person involved.\n\nFirst, thrift stores rely on donations and selling these items to fund their charitable work, like Goodwill and Salvation Army. When someone buys an item and resells it, they're taking away a potential sale from the store, which could affect their ability to support their missions. However, the stores sell their items to the public, so technically, once a customer purchases an item, they own it and can do with it as they please, including reselling. That's a legal standpoint.\n\nBut there's an ethical angle here. The person is making a profit from items that were donated, possibly by people in need. The woman who confronted them argues that they're exploiting a system meant to help others. However, thrift stores operate on the premise that donated goods are for sale to the public. The store's policy might not explicitly prohibit reselling, so the person isn't necessarily breaking any rules by buying and reselling.\n\nThe cashier banned the person from shopping, which is the store's right to set their own policies. But if there's no explicit rule against reselling, the ban could be seen as a subjective decision. The person wasn't stealing; they were purchasing items legally. Therefore, from a legal perspective, they aren't in the wrong. Ethically, it's debatable, but the question seems to lean more on legal/ethical responsibility rather than moral judgment. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the information, the answer would be B, No, they aren't in the wrong because they're following the rules as presented.\n"
