I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person goes to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buys items, then sells them on eBay. They keep it a secret because they've had stores raise prices once they knew. This time, a woman confronted them, called them a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper,\" and got the store to ban them. The person is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is it ethical to buy items from thrift stores to resell? What about the store's policies? The woman's accusation that they're stealing from the less fortunate. The store's response banning them.\n\nThrift stores sell donated items. The purpose is to provide affordable goods and support charitable causes. If someone is buying these items to resell for profit, that might conflict with the store's mission. But is it against the law? Probably not. However, some stores might have policies against bulk purchasing or reselling. The person mentioned they kept their reselling secret, which might indicate they knew it was frowned upon.\n\nThe woman accused them of taking from the less fortunate. That's a moral argument. Thrift stores do help people who can't afford new items. If someone is buying those items to flip, they're not contributing to that cause. But the items are available for purchase, so technically, anyone can buy them. The ethical dilemma is whether it's wrong to profit from items that were meant to be affordable for others.\n\nThe store banned them after the confrontation. The cashier might have a policy against reselling, or perhaps the store feels it's against their mission. If the store has a rule against it, then the person violated that rule, making them in the wrong. If there's no such rule, then the store overstepped.\n\nSo, the person's actions might be legal but ethically questionable. The store's policy (if it exists) would matter. The woman's argument is about ethics and the intended purpose of the thrift store. The user's friend says the author is in the wrong, so the user is seeking validation.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the store had a policy against reselling. If they did, then the author violated it. If not, maybe not. But since the author went to great lengths to hide their reselling, it suggests they knew it wasn't allowed. So, ethically, they might be in the wrong for exploiting the store's mission for profit. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) based on ethical considerations and potential breach of store policy.\n"
