I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. They mention they keep it secret to avoid higher prices. The store employee gets angry and bans them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of thrift stores. Most thrift stores, like Goodwill or Salvation Army, rely on donations and are non-profits. Their primary goal is to resell donated items to fund their operations. However, they usually don't prohibit people from buying items from them. The key point here is whether there's a rule against purchasing with the intent to resell. If the store didn't have such a policy, the person isn't breaking any rules. \n\nThe woman who confronted the author accused her of stealing from the less fortunate. But when you buy an item from a thrift store, you're purchasing it from the organization, not from the individual who donated it. The organization sells items to fund their charitable work, so the author's resale is a separate transaction. \n\nHowever, some stores might have a policy against flipping items to maintain the community-focused mission. If Goodwill in this case had such a policy and the author was aware, they might be in the wrong. But the author states they tried to keep it secret, implying they were under the impression it was allowed. \n\nThe cashier banned the author for reselling. Unless there's a clear policy against it, this could be a strict or unfair reaction. If there's no official rule, the cashier overstepped. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while it's not illegal, some people might see it as unethical, especially if it takes away items that could help others. But legally and policy-wise, unless the store prohibits reselling, the author isn't wrong. The cashier's decision might be based on a policy the author wasn't aware of, but there's no indication that policy exists. \n\nSo, unless there's a specific store rule against reselling, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
