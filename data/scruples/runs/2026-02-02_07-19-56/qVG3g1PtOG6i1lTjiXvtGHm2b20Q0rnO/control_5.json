I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who flips thrift store items is in the wrong. The situation is that the author buys items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. They kept it a secret to avoid price hikes. Then a woman called them out, leading to being banned and threatened with police involvement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and legality. Legally, when you buy something from a thrift store, you own it. There's no law against reselling items you've purchased. So the author isn't breaking any laws here. However, the moral aspect is trickier. Thrift stores rely on donations, and the proceeds often go to charitable causes. If the author is buying up potential items that might have been sold to support the store's mission, that could be seen as taking from the charity's revenue. But does that make it unethical? Some might argue that the store is selling items to make money, so if someone else is willing to buy them and the store profits, it's a free market. Others might think it's exploiting the fact that donations are meant to help others, not for someone's profit.\n\nThe woman's argument is that the author is taking from the less fortunate. But thrift stores themselves are often for-profit or nonprofit, but they serve a charitable purpose. The author isn't taking the items from donors; they're purchasing them. So the author might not have done anything wrong ethically. The cashier banning them could be overreaching, but it's their store policy. However, threatening police involvement over a resale might be excessive.\n\nAlso, the author tried to be honest once confronted, so maybe they weren't being deceptive beyond their initial secrecy. The key here is whether reselling purchased items is permissible. Since the author isn't stealing or hoarding donated goods, but buying them at retail prices, it's a gray area but legally and ethically perhaps not their fault. The cashier's reaction might be harsh, but the author's actions themselves aren't clearly wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
