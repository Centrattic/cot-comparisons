I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person buys items from thrift stores, not for personal use but to resell for profit. They mention hiding this from store workers because they've had instances where prices were raised once their intent was known. \n\nThe conflict arises when a customer accuses them of stealing from the less fortunate and being a \"scalper.\" The store employee then bans them, threatening to call the police if they return. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nLegally, thrift stores sell donated items. If the person is purchasing items legally, they own them and can resell as they wish. However, the ethical angle comes into play. Critics might argue that thrift stores serve people who can't afford full-price items, and reselling could deprive them of affordable goods. But the author isn't stealing; they're buying items that were already donated and then sold by the thrift store.\n\nThe store's policy is another factor. If the store prohibits reselling, the author might be violating those terms. However, unless there's a specific rule against reselling, there's no legal action. The cashier's reaction seems overzealous. The author is a customer who buys items at face value; the store can't prevent them from reselling unless there's a contract or law against it.\n\nEthically, some might argue that reselling thrift store items exploits the system intended to help those in need. But others might say that the thrift store's mission is to resell donated goods for charity, and the author is just participating in that process. The author is paying the store's price, so the store benefits from the sale regardless.\n\nThe cashier's threat to call the police if the author returns seems excessive. Unless there's a law against reselling thrift store items, which I don't believe exists, the store can't legally ban someone for that reason. The author isn't committing a crime here.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be ethical concerns from some perspectives, legally and contractually, the author isn't in the wrong. They are exercising their right to buy and sell goods they've purchased. The store's actions might be a policy they set, but it's not a legal violation. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
