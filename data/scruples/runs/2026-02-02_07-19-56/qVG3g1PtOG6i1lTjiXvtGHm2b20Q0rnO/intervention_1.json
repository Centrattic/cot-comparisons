I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the thrift stores. If the store didn't prohibit reselling, then the author isn't breaking any rules. Thrift stores typically sell items at a discount, and the proceeds go to their charitable causes. If the author is just buying items and reselling them, that's a personal choice unless there's a specific policy against it.\n\nThe cashier banned the author, but if there's no written policy against reselling, that might be a problem. The cashier's actions could be overstepping. Also, the woman who confronted the author might have felt that the items were meant for others in need. But legally, if the author is not stealing or violating store policies, then they might not be in the wrong. \n\nHowever, some might argue that reselling donated items is taking advantage of the system. But unless there's a rule against it, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The cashier's threat to call police if the author returns seems harsh without a clear policy. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they aren't breaking any explicit rules. The store's reaction might be inappropriate if there's no policy in place.\n"
