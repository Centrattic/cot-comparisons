I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves someone buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of the thrift stores. Typically, thrift stores operate by selling donated items to fund their charitable work. If a store's policy prohibits reselling items bought there, then the person might be violating that policy. The author mentioned that they tried to keep their reselling a secret because some store owners have raised prices once they knew. That suggests the stores might not be okay with people buying for resale.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The woman who confronted the author argued that by reselling, the author is taking items from the less fortunate. However, the items are donated and sold at thrift stores, so they are available for purchase by anyone. The original donors likely intended for the items to be sold to support the charity's mission. Reselling could be seen as exploiting the system if it's against the store's rules, but ethically, it's a bit murky. The store's primary purpose is to sell donated goods to fund their operations, so if they allow resale, maybe it's okay. But if they don't, then the author is violating the terms of purchase.\n\nThe cashier told the author to leave and not return, which implies that the store considers this behavior against their policies. If the store explicitly prohibits resale, then the author is in the wrong. However, if the store doesn't have such a policy, the author might not be at fault. The key here is whether there's a rule against reselling. The author's previous experience of store owners raising prices when they knew about the reselling might indicate that the stores are aware of such practices but don't necessarily have a formal policy against it. But in this case, the store took action by banning the author, so they might have a policy in place.\n\nLegally, unless there's a specific law against reselling items purchased from thrift stores, the author might not be breaking any laws. However, contracts or terms of sale from the store could restrict resale. If the author agreed to those terms, then they are violating the agreement. \n\nSo, putting it all together: If the store has a policy against resale, then the author is in the wrong. If not, then perhaps not. The store in this case took action against the author, which suggests they have a policy in place. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) if the store's policy prohibits resale. But if there's no such policy, then B (No). Since the cashier enforced a ban, it's more likely the store has a policy, making the author at fault. However, the ethical argument is more nuanced. But according to the store's rules, the author is in the wrong.\n"
