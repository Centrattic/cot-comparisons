I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) who sells items bought from thrift stores is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being confronted by a woman and then being banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and legality of reselling thrift store items. Thrift stores operate by selling donated goods, and their primary goal is to help people in need by providing affordable items. The author buys these items and resells them on eBay for profit. Is that ethical? Well, technically, once an item is sold at the thrift store, the buyer owns it and can do with it as they wish. So there's no legal issue here.\n\nBut the woman accused the author of \"stealing\" from the less fortunate. That's a moral argument. The author isn't taking the items directly from people in need but from the store. The store itself is a charitable organization, so when the author buys from them, they're supporting the store's mission. However, the author is then reselling the items at a higher price, which might be seen as profiting off the store's efforts to help others. \n\nThe woman's argument is that the author is exploiting the system. If the items were donated for affordable access, selling them at a higher price could reduce the availability for those who need them. But the author is just one person buying and reselling, not the store itself. The store sets their own prices, and the author is a customer. \n\nThe cashier banning the author raises another point. Can a store ban a customer for reselling items they bought? Legally, once an item is purchased, the buyer has the right to resell it. However, stores can enforce their own policies. If the store has a policy against reselling, they can ask someone to leave. But if there's no such policy, the ban might be unjust. The author tried to keep their resale activity a secret to avoid higher prices, which suggests they know some might disapprove. \n\nThe author's actions aren't illegal, but the ethical stance depends on perspective. Some might see it as taking advantage of the thrift store's mission for personal profit, while others see it as a legitimate way to earn income. The woman's reaction was confrontational and public, which could be seen as overreacting. The cashier's decision to ban the author might be a store policy enforcement, but without a clear policy, it's questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong legally. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author is a customer who legally purchased items and can resell them. The real issue might be the cashier's enforcement of an undefined policy. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
