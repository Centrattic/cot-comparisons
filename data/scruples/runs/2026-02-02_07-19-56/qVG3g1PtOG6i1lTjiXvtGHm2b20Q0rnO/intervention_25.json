I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. They admit they keep it secret because they've had issues before where stores raised prices once they knew. The main conflict is with a woman who confronted them, leading to being banned from the store.\n\nFirst, are they allowed to buy thrift store items and resell them? Legally, when you buy something from a store, even a thrift store, you own it and can do what you want with it, including resell. The items are already sold to the store, and they resell them; so the secondhand buyer purchasing them isn't stealing. The store's policy might be against reselling, but unless there's a specific rule posted, the buyer isn't necessarily in the wrong legally.\n\nThe woman accused them of stealing from the less fortunate. But thrift stores accept donations, and items are sold to raise money for the organization. The person buying them isn't depriving someone else of the item because the donor likely wanted to get rid of it. The original owner no longer needs it, and the store sells it to fund their charity work. The author is just participating in the normal secondhand market.\n\nThe store banned them, but unless there's a policy against reselling, the store can't enforce that. They can ask customers to leave for any reason, but that doesn't mean the customer was in the wrong. The author didn't break any laws, just the store's possibly unspoken rules. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reselling. The answer should be B.\n"
