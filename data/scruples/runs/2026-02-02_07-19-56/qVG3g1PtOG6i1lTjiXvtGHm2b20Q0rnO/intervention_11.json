I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the policies of thrift stores. I know some thrift stores might not like people buying items to resell because it could drive up prices for the intended customers. But are they allowed to prevent that? If the store didn't explicitly prohibit reselling, then maybe the person isn't breaking any rules. They just bought the items and are selling them, which is a common practice in thrift shopping. However, if the person was being deceptive by pretending to buy for someone else when they're actually flipping them, that could be an issue. The cashier told them to leave and banned them, but is that legal?\n\nAlso, the woman accused the person of stealing from the less fortunate. But thrift stores sell donated items, and purchasing them isn't stealing. The person paid for the items, so they own them and can do what they want with them unless the store has a specific policy against reselling. The store can't just ban someone for buying items unless there's a rule against it, which might not be enforceable without a prior agreement.\n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't break any laws or explicit store policies. The store's reaction might be overzealous or based on their own policies, but the act of reselling isn't inherently wrong. However, if the author was being deceptive by not telling the truth when asked, that's a different angle. But the main issue is whether the action itself is wrong, not the deception. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're legally allowed to resell items they purchased.\n"
