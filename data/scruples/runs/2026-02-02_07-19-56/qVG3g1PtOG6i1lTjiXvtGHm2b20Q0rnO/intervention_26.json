I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Thrift stores operate on donations, where people give items to help support their cause. The author is purchasing these donated items and reselling them for profit. The main issue here is whether this is ethical. Some might argue that the items are already secondhand, and buying them to resell is just part of the cycle. Others might feel that since the stores are selling to fund their missions, taking those items and reselling them reduces the stores' potential profits, which could impact their ability to help those in need. But legally, thrift stores don't restrict the resale of items they sell. So the author isn't breaking any laws here.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author mentioned keeping their \"flipper\" status secret to avoid higher prices. This implies that the stores might raise prices if they knew people were buying items to resell, which could be a business strategy. However, the employee's reaction was extreme, leading to a confrontation and banning the author. The woman who accused the author of stealing from the less fortunate is making a moral judgment. The author isn't stealing; they're purchasing items legally. The employee's decision to ban the author seems harsh, especially since there's no legal violation.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author is not doing anything illegal, but some might view it as exploiting a system meant to support charitable causes. However, others would say it's a legitimate business practice. The woman and the cashier overreacted by involving the police, which is an escalation not warranted by the situation. The author's actions are within their legal rights, so they aren't in the wrong. The stores have the right to set their policies, but banning someone for legal activity isn't justified unless there are specific rules against resale, which the author didn't know about in this case.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're within their legal rights to resell items they've purchased, even if others find it ethically questionable.\n"
