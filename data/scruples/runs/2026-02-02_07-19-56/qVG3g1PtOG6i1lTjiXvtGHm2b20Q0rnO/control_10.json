I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. The situation involves the author buying items to resell on eBay, which led to a confrontation at Goodwill.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of Goodwill and similar stores. Typically, when you buy an item from a thrift store, you purchase it at retail, and there's no explicit prohibition on reselling it. However, some stores might have specific rules against reselling, especially if they catch someone doing it repeatedly. The cashier told the author to leave and not come back, which suggests that Goodwill might have such a policy in place. If the store's terms and conditions prohibit reselling, then the author might be in the wrong. But if there's no such rule, then the cashier overstepped.\n\nNext, the author was trying to keep their eBay business a secret to avoid higher prices. This could imply that the author believes their actions are within the store's acceptable practices. However, the cashier's reaction indicates that the store doesn't support flipping items. The woman's accusation about stealing from the less fortunate is more of an ethical argument rather than a legal one. Legally, buying items from a store and reselling them is allowed, but the store's policy might override that.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical consideration. Thrift stores rely on donations to fund their charitable work. If people are buying items to resell, it could reduce the availability of those items for lower-income shoppers. However, this is a moral debate rather than a legal issue. The store's response was to ban the author, which might be based on their own rules rather than a legal wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the store's policies versus the author's actions. If the store allows resale, the author isn't wrong. If the store prohibits it, then the author violated their policy. The cashier's decision to ban the author suggests a store policy against reselling. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong based on the store's rules, even if it's not illegal. The ethical angle adds complexity but doesn't legally bind the author.\n"
