I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. They mention that they keep their eBay activity a secret to avoid price increases. When confronted, they admitted to it, leading to being banned from the store.\n\nFirst, the legality aspect: Thrift stores sell donated items, and buying them for resale isn't illegal. There's no law against purchasing items from second-hand stores to resell. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's an ethical angle.\n\nEthically, some might argue that thrift stores serve a charitable purpose, helping those in need by providing affordable goods. If someone is buying these items to resell at a profit, it could be seen as exploiting the system. However, others might argue that it's a free market; the stores sell items at prices they set, and anyone can buy them. The author isn't stealing or hoarding items, just purchasing them and reselling. They even mention donating to the stores, which could be a counterpoint.\n\nThe store employee's reaction is another factor. The cashier banned the author, which might be an overreaction. The store isn't a private club that can restrict who can buy items. Unless there's a store policy against reselling, the cashier doesn't have the authority to prohibit the author from shopping there. The threat of calling the police if they return is problematic because the author hasn't committed a crime.\n\nThe woman who confronted the author accused her of \"stealing from the less fortunate.\" But the items were already sold by the thrift store, so the author isn't taking them directly from donors. The store's revenue supports their charitable work, so if reselling reduces potential customers, it might impact their funds. However, it's still a matter of personal choice and market dynamics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are legal and, while some may find them ethically questionable, there's no clear wrongdoing. The store's response seems inappropriate, especially the threat of police involvement. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
