I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the person is buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. They mention that they keep their eBay activity a secret from the store employees because they've had issues before where prices were raised once they found out. Then, a customer confronts them, calls them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" and the store cashier kicks them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Thrift stores are meant for reselling donated items, so technically, buying items from them and reselling isn't illegal. However, the issue here is the perception and the store's policies. The cashier might have a policy against resellers because they don't want people profiting from donated goods. But is that a valid reason to ban someone?\n\nThe person isn't stealing; they're purchasing items at retail price. So legally, they're not doing anything wrong. Ethically, some might argue that reselling donated goods takes away opportunities for others who might need the items. But others might say it's a free market and they have the right to buy and sell as they wish.\n\nThe cashier threatened to call the police if they returned, which could be problematic because unless there's a specific law against reselling, it's a civil issue, not criminal. The person isn't in the wrong legally, but the store might have their own rules. However, the store can't legally ban someone just for reselling unless their policy explicitly prohibits it and they made the person aware beforehand.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering all angles, the person isn't breaking the law, so the answer would be B. But I need to make sure there's no ethical obligation here. Ethically, some might side with the cashier, but legally and in terms of rightness, the person isn't in the wrong. The store's reaction was harsh, and if they didn't previously inform customers of a no-resale policy, the ban might be unfair. So the answer is B.\n"
