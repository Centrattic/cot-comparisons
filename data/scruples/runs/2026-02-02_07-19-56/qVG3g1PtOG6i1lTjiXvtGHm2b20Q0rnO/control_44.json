I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about someone buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The key points here are the ethical considerations and the store's policies.\n\nFirst, thrift stores are non-profits that rely on donations. Their goal is to sell used items at low prices to make a profit for their organization. If someone buys items there to flip for a profit, that could reduce the number of items available to people who need them, potentially hurting the store's sales. But is that the customer's fault? If the store sells items at a price, and a customer buys them, then resells, is that against the law? Probably not. It's legal to buy something and sell it again, as long as you own it. So legally, the person isn't doing anything wrong.\n\nBut ethically, some might argue that they're taking advantage of the system. Thrift stores exist to help others, and flipping items might not align with that mission. However, the person mentions they keep their activity secret to avoid higher prices, which implies that the store might not have a policy against it. If the store didn't explicitly prohibit flipping, then the person isn't in violation of any rules. The cashier who banned them might have acted on a personal opinion, not a store policy. \n\nThe woman who confronted the person was upset, but unless there's a rule against buying items to resell, the person isn't in the wrong. The cashier's reaction might be excessive if there's no such policy. So, legally and ethically, the person isn't necessarily at fault. It's a gray area, but the person's actions don't seem to violate any explicit rules. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
