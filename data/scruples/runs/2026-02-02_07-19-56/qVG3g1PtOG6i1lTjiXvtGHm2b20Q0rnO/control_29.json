I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author goes to stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buys items, and sells them on eBay. They mention keeping their eBay activity secret because they've had prices raised. That part seems like a business practice, maybe a bit sneaky to avoid higher costs but not inherently unethical.\n\nThen, a customer confronts them, accuses them of stealing from the less fortunate. The cashier then bans them. The main ethical question here is whether reselling items purchased from thrift stores is wrong.\n\nThrift stores sell donated items. The stores are non-profits, relying on sales to fund their charitable work. When someone buys an item from a thrift store, they own it and can do with it what they want. Reselling is generally legal unless there's a specific restriction. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. However, the ethical angle is trickier. The donor's intention might have been to help others, but once the item is sold by the store, the buyer has the right to resell it. The author isn't stealing; they're purchasing secondhand items. \n\nThe cashier's reaction might stem from the store's policy against resellers, which some stores do have to prevent people from buying cheap and flipping them for profit. If the store has such a policy, the author might be violating it. However, unless there's a clear rule at the entrance or stated when purchasing, the store can't enforce that. The cashier's threat to call the police if they return is questionable. Legally, the store can't ban someone just for reselling unless there's a specific rule in place.\n\nEthically, some might argue that taking items meant to be affordable for low-income people and selling them for profit is wrong. But others would counter that the author is just buying items at a discount and selling them, which is a form of entrepreneurial activity. The store benefits from the sale, and the author is not stealing. \n\nThe cashier's claim that the items should go to someone who wants them is a bit circular. The author is the one purchasing them, so they are fulfilling that role. The store's main purpose is to sell items to fund their missions, so if a customer is willing to buy and resell, that still supports the store's mission. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong legally. The cashier overstepped by banning them and threatening police involvement without a clear policy. Ethically, it's debatable, but the author is within their rights. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
