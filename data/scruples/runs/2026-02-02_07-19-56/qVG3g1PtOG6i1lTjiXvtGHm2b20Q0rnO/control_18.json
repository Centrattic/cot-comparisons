I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author goes to thrift stores, buys items, and sells them online. They try to keep this a secret from the store workers because they've had issues before where prices were raised once the workers knew. At a Goodwill, they were confronted by a woman who accused them of being a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper.\" The cashier then banned them from the store and threatened to call the police if they returned.\n\nSo, the main question is whether reselling thrift store items is unethical or against the stores' policies. Let me think about the store's perspective. Thrift stores typically sell donated items to raise funds for their respective charities. If someone buys items to resell, they might be taking items that could have been sold to support the charity, thereby reducing the store's revenue. That could be seen as unethical because the store's primary purpose is to fund their charitable work, not to be a resale market for resellers.\n\nHowever, from the author's side, they're buying items at the store's prices, which are set by the store. If the store allows customers to purchase items without restrictions, then reselling might be a personal choice. But many stores might have policies against bulk buying or reselling, especially if it's on a large scale. The author mentions they do this as a hobby and for extra income, so maybe it's not in bulk. \n\nThe key points here are the store's policies and the ethical implications. The woman who confronted the author argued that the items were donated, implying that reselling takes from those who might need the items more. The cashier banned the author, which suggests the store doesn't allow resale. If the store's terms of service prohibit reselling, then the author is in the wrong. But if there's no such policy, it's a gray area.\n\nLegally, as long as the author is buying items at retail price and reselling them, it's probably allowed. However, stores can set their own rules. If the store has a rule against reselling and the author knew or should have known about it, then they might be violating that rule. The author did try to hide their identity as a reseller, which could imply they knew the store's policies or that other customers might not want their items resold. \n\nEthically, it's a debate. Some might say that thrift stores rely on selling items to fund their missions, so taking items to resell could hinder that. Others might argue that the store sells items for their fair price, and customers are free to do with them as they wish. \n\nIn this case, the cashier banned the author, which is the store's right if they have a policy against reselling. The author's actions led to a confrontation and the loss of access to the store. While it's not illegal, the store's rules and the ethical considerations are important factors. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong according to the store's policies and the ethical standpoint of not supporting the store's charitable mission. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
