I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by selling thrift store items on eBay. The situation involves a confrontation where the author was accused of taking from the less fortunate and being banned from the store.\n\nFirst, legally, buying items from thrift stores and reselling them isn't illegal. Thrift stores sell donated goods, and once someone purchases an item, they own it. So the author isn't breaking the law here. However, the ethical angle is more nuanced. The woman and cashier accused the author of exploiting donated goods. The key point here is that the items were already sold by the thrift store; the author bought them secondhand. The thrift store's purpose is to resell donated items to fund their charitable work. If the author is buying these items and reselling them, they might be reducing the store's potential revenue, which could indirectly affect their ability to help those in need. But the author isn't stopping the store from doing their job\u2014other people buy items too, not just the author. \n\nThe cashier banning the author might be overstepping, as the store can't prevent customers from purchasing items they've bought legally. However, stores can set their own policies. If they don't want customers who flip items, they can ask them to leave. But is the author in the wrong? The author isn't violating any laws or store rules unless the store explicitly prohibits resale. The ethical concern is whether profiting from donated goods is fair. Some might argue that the original donors intended for the items to go to people in need, not for reselling. But others might say that the thrift store's primary goal is to generate funds, and if the author is buying their items, it's part of the market.\n\nThe author tried to keep their activity secret, which could be seen as deceptive if they were trying to avoid higher prices. But the woman figured it out. The cashier's reaction seems harsh, but the author isn't at fault for being banned unless they broke a specific rule. Legally, they're in the clear. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author is using a legal loophole to make money, which some may find unethical, especially if it affects the store's ability to support their cause. However, there's no clear consensus on ethics here. The answer hinges on whether one prioritizes the store's charitable mission over individual profit. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author didn't break any laws or explicit rules, the answer might be that they're not in the wrong. But if the store's policy prohibits resale, then they could be in violation. The scenario doesn't mention such a policy, so the author might not be at fault.\n"
