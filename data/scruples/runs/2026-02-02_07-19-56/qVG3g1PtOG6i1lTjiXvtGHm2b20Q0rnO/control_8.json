I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The key points here are the ethics of reselling thrift store items and the consequences faced by the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the thrift stores. Typically, thrift stores operate by selling donated goods at low prices to make them accessible to others. If the author is buying these items with the intent to resell, especially at a higher price on eBay, that could be seen as taking advantage of the system. However, unless the store explicitly prohibits reselling, it might be a gray area. The author mentions they try to keep their Ebay activity secret because some owners raised prices when they found out. This suggests that while not illegal, it's a practice the stores might disapprove of.\n\nNext, the woman who confronted the author accused her of stealing from the less fortunate. While the items were donated, they weren't stolen. The author is purchasing items already sold by the store, so the store isn't losing out directly. However, the store's mission is to help those in need, so reselling could be seen as undermining that mission by taking items that others might need and selling them for profit.\n\nThe cashier then banned the author, which might be an overreaction legally, but stores can set their own policies. The author's actions might not be illegal, but they could be against the store's ethical guidelines. The main question is whether the author's actions are morally wrong. Some might argue that reselling is just a form of entrepreneurship, while others think it's exploiting a good cause. \n\nIn terms of the law, unless there's a specific policy against reselling, the author isn't breaking any laws. But ethically, it's debatable. The store's stance is that they want items to go to people who need them, not to be resold. The author's activity could reduce availability or drive up prices if others do the same. However, the author is contributing to the economy by creating value through their effort in finding and reselling items.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on ethical perspective. Legally, the author isn't wrong, but ethically, some might see it as taking advantage of the system. However, the cashier's action to ban them might be within their rights, but the confrontation by the woman was aggressive. The author's actions are a common practice for many thrifters, so it's a matter of opinion. The key takeaway is that while not illegal, the ethical judgment is subjective. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because it's not against the law, but others might argue A based on ethics.\n"
