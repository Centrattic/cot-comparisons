I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. The scenario is that the person buys items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. They got caught and banned from a Goodwill after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the thrift stores. Most thrift stores operate under the assumption that items are being sold for their own use, not for resale. The author mentioned they tried to keep their activity secret because they've had prices raised when stores found out. This implies that the stores might have policies against reselling. If the stores explicitly prohibit reselling, then the author is violating those terms, making them wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the purpose of thrift stores. They rely on donations and aim to provide affordable goods to people in need. Reselling could take items that others might need and turn them into profit. However, thrift stores do sell items at a discount, and if someone can afford to buy those items and resell them, it's a legal activity unless prohibited. The ethical debate here is tricky. Legally, unless there's a specific rule against it, reselling might be allowed. But ethically, some might argue it's exploiting a system meant to help others.\n\nThe confrontation itself: the woman accused the author of stealing from the less fortunate. While that's a strong accusation, the author is technically buying the items, not stealing. The cashier then banned the author, possibly based on store policy. If the store has a rule against reselling, the author is in violation. If not, the store might be overstepping.\n\nSo, the key factors are: store policies, legality, and ethics. Legally, unless there's a law against it, reselling is allowed. Ethically, opinions vary. If the store's policy prohibits it, then the author is wrong. But if the policy doesn't, then the author isn't. The cashier's action was based on the woman's accusation and their own policy. The author might be in the wrong if the store's policy forbids resale, which seems likely given their past experience with prices being raised when stores found out. So the answer is A.\n"
