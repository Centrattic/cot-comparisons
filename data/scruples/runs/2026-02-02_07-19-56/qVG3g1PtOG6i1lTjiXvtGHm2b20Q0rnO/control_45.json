I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores on eBay. They mention they keep it a secret from the store workers because some have raised prices once they found out. Then this woman confronted them, the worker banned them from the store, and now they want to know if they were at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the thrift stores. Thrift stores like Goodwill usually have a policy against reselling items. I remember reading before that some stores sell items at a discount for people to use, not to resell. If they catch you, they might ask you to return the items or ban you. So if the store explicitly prohibits reselling, then the person is violating their terms. That would make them in the wrong, answer A.\n\nBut wait, maybe there's a gray area. Some people do resell thrift store items in bulk, but maybe individually it's allowed. However, the store owner here told them to leave and threatened police if they returned. That suggests the store's policy is strict against reselling. Also, the person was hiding the fact that they were a reseller, which could imply they knew it was against the rules.\n\nThe woman's argument was that they're stealing from the less fortunate. But thrift stores are meant for people to donate items for others to purchase at low cost. If someone buys an item and resells it at a higher price, it's taking an item that was meant to be affordable for others and profiting from it, which could be seen as unethical.\n\nHowever, legally, unless the store has a clear policy against reselling and they enforce it, the person might not be breaking any laws. But if the store does have such a policy, then they're violating the store's terms. The key here is whether the store explicitly prohibits reselling. Since the cashier banned them and mentioned police, it's likely that the store's policy is against it. Therefore, the person is in the wrong for breaking the store's rules. So answer A.\n"
