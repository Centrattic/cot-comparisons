I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about selling thrift store items on eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Thrift stores sell donated goods, right? So when you buy items from them, you're getting second-hand stuff that people have given away. The writer is buying these items and reselling them for profit. \n\nThe woman who confronted them called them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" suggesting that it's unethical. The cashier then banned the writer from the store. \n\nI should think about whether reselling thrift items is considered stealing. Since the items are already sold by the thrift store, once you purchase them, they legally belong to you. So reselling them isn't theft. But maybe the issue is about taking items that were donated by people in need and then profiting from them. \n\nHowever, thrift stores operate on the principle that donated items are sold to generate funds for their charitable causes. So when you buy an item, you're supporting the store's mission. The writer is just taking advantage of the fact that some items are underpriced and flipping them for profit. \n\nOn the other hand, the cashier and the woman felt that the writer was exploiting the system. But legally, the writer isn't doing anything wrong. They're following the same process as any other customer. The cashier banning them based on their resale activity might be overstepping, unless there's a specific store policy against it. \n\nThe writer didn't lie initially but tried to cover up their eBay activity. When confronted, they were honest. The cashier's reaction seems extreme. Unless the store has a policy against buying for resale, which wasn't mentioned, the writer isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting within their rights as a customer. The store's reaction might be harsh, but the writer isn't stealing or violating any laws.\n"
