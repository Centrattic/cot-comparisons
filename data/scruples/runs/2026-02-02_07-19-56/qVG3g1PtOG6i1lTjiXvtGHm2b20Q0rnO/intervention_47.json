I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for reselling items they bought from thrift stores. They go to places like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buy stuff to sell on eBay, and now someone called them out. The store employee told them to leave and not come back.\n\nHmm, the key points here. Thrift stores are non-profits, right? They rely on donations and sales to fund their missions, like helping the needy. When you buy from them, you're paying the store, not the individual who donated the item. So technically, the person owns the item once they buy it. But there's a moral aspect here. The woman accused them of stealing from the less fortunate. Is that accurate?\n\nThe user is taking items that were donated to support these charities and then reselling them. By doing so, they're removing potential items from the store, which could mean the store sells fewer items and thus has less funds. That could impact their ability to help those in need. So maybe there's an ethical issue here even if it's not illegal.\n\nBut the user isn't taking directly from the donors; they're purchasing. The problem might be that their actions reduce the store's revenue. However, the store is a business. If someone buys items from them, they can't control where they go after purchase. So legally, the user isn't doing anything wrong. But ethically, is it right to buy from a store that serves a charitable purpose just to resell for profit?\n\nAlso, the woman in the store accused them of taking from people who might need the items. If someone donated a shirt because they wanted to give it to someone else who needs it, and the user buys it to resell, that could be seen as taking it away from someone who really needs it. That's a moral dilemma. But again, the user is paying the store, not the original donor. The store might have a different perspective. They might prefer people buy items for use rather than resale, but they can't control that once the sale is made.\n\nThe store employee then banned the user, which could be their policy. If they have a rule against reselling, the user might be violating it. But unless the store explicitly states that reselling is prohibited on their website or at the point of purchase, the user might not be informed. So maybe the store's policy isn't communicated clearly, which could affect the user's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of the law, buying items from a store and reselling them is generally allowed under the first sale doctrine, which permits the owner of a copy to resell it. So legally, they're in the right. But ethically, it's a gray area. The store's mission is to provide affordable items to those in need and fund their charitable work. If reselling takes away potential sales from the store, it could be seen as undermining their mission.\n\nThe user's intentions are to make extra money, which is understandable. However, if their actions are reducing the store's ability to help others, there's a moral obligation to consider. The store employee's reaction is also valid because they want to protect their mission and ensure items stay in the community.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the user is okay. Ethically, it's debatable. The store might have policies against resale, but if not, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the user is impacting the store's revenue indirectly. The woman's accusation about stealing from the poor is a moral argument but might be an overstatement. The user isn't stealing; they're purchasing. But the ethical dilemma remains. The store's decision to ban them is their right, but the user isn't necessarily in the wrong legally. The answer might be B, but there's a strong ethical argument for A. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, not just ethical, maybe the answer is B because there's no legal wrongdoing.\n"
