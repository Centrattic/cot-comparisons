I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is at fault (AITA) for selling items bought from thrift stores on eBay. They mentioned they're a thrifter and keep it secret to avoid higher prices. The situation escalated when a woman accused them of stealing from the less fortunate and being a \"flipper.\" The cashier then banned them and said they'd call the police if they returned.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to determine if selling thrift store items is unethical. Thrift stores sell donated goods, so when you buy them, you own them, right? Legally, once something is sold at a thrift store, the buyer can do whatever they want with it, including reselling. So legally, the person isn't in the wrong. But the ethical aspect is trickier. The woman argued that the items were donated to help the less fortunate, implying that reselling them takes away from that purpose. However, when you purchase an item from a thrift store, you're paying for it, so the store uses that money for their cause. The person is repurposing the items they bought, which is their right as an owner. \n\nThe cashier's reaction seems extreme. If the store's policy allows customers to resell, then banning someone for that isn't justified. But maybe the cashier felt it's against the store's mission, which is to provide affordable goods to people in need. However, as a for-profit resale, the store's existence already relies on selling items, so the customer flipping them is just another part of the market. The person's actions aren't illegal, and the cashier overstepped by threatening police involvement. The woman's anger might stem from a misunderstanding that thrift stores are non-profits that give things for free, but they do sell items, and customers can resell what they purchase. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
