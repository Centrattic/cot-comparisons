I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for reselling items bought from thrift stores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author goes to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buys items, and sells them on eBay. They keep it secret to avoid higher prices. In this case, a woman called them out, leading to being banned from the store.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here are legal, ethical, and the policies of the thrift stores. Legally, when you buy something from a store, even a thrift store, you own the item and can do with it as you like, including reselling. So there's no legal wrongdoing here. The author isn't stealing; they're purchasing items and reselling them.\n\nEthically, this is more subjective. The woman's argument is that the author is taking items that were donated for the purpose of helping others, and by reselling them, the author is profiting from someone else's charity. However, thrift stores operate on a for-profit basis as well. They rely on donations but also need to make money to sustain their operations. If the author is just buying and reselling, it's a free-market activity. The items are already being sold to the public, so the author isn't preventing the original owner (the person who donated) from getting a better price, since the item was already donated for sale.\n\nAnother angle is the policy of the specific store. The cashier banned the author after the confrontation. Whether that's justified depends on the store's rules. If the store allows reselling, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the store has a policy against it, then the author might be violating that policy. However, typically, thrift stores only restrict items that are for resale within their own stores, not by third parties. So unless the store explicitly prohibits resale of purchased items, the author isn't breaking any rules.\n\nThe author's secrecy about being a \"flipper\" might be a point of contention. The woman felt called out, but the author has a right to privacy in their purchasing habits unless it's against the store's policy to disclose such intentions. The cashier's decision to ban the author could be based on misunderstanding or a strict policy against reselling, but without explicit rules against it, that might not hold.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't legally or ethically in the wrong for reselling items they purchased. The store's policy is unclear, but unless they explicitly prohibit resale, the author's actions are legitimate. The cashier overstepped by banning the author without clear justification. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
