I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay, which the author calls a hobby and a source of income. The conflict arises when a customer accuses them of stealing from the less fortunate and taking items that others might want. The cashier then bans them from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the act of buying and reselling thrift store items is ethically or legally wrong. Legally, when you purchase something from a thrift store, you own it and can do with it as you like, including reselling. So the author isn't breaking any laws here. Ethically, it's a bit trickier. Some people might argue that thrift stores rely on donations and that reselling could reduce the availability of items to those in need. However, others might counter that the stores are selling items to raise funds, and the author is just buying those items like any other customer.\n\nThe cashier's decision to ban the author seems excessive if there's no store policy against reselling. The author was being honest about their eBay store after being confronted, which shows they weren't trying to deceive. The cashier's reaction might be based on a misunderstanding of the author's intentions. The woman's accusation about stealing is misplaced because the items were sold by the store, not taken directly from donors. \n\nThe key points here are legality versus ethics. Legally, the author is in the right. Ethically, there's room for debate, but it's not clear that the author is wrong. The cashier overstepped by banning them without a clear policy. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
