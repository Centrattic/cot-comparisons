I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The question is whether that makes them at fault (AITA). \n\nFirst, the stores are places where people donate used items. The stores sell these items to make money, which supports their charitable missions. The person buying the items is essentially purchasing them at retail prices. So, from a legal standpoint, they're just customers buying products. There's no rule against reselling purchased goods, unless there's a specific store policy against it. However, the user mentioned that some store owners have raised prices once they knew about their eBay flipping, implying that there might be an unspoken expectation not to do so. But legally, that's not a violation.\n\nThe woman who confronted them called them a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper.\" Scalping usually refers to reselling tickets at a higher price, which is different. But here, it's about thrift store items. There's no law against reselling thrift store items unless the items are stolen, which they aren't in this case.\n\nThe cashier then banned them from the store. If the store's policy prohibits reselling, then the store could enforce that, but if there's no such policy stated, it's a bit iffy. The user didn't know there was a policy against it, so the store might need to have a clear rule in place to enforce such a ban.\n\nEthically, some might argue that buying donated items to resell takes away from the chance of lower-income individuals to get affordable items. However, the stores are for-profit businesses, even if they have charitable missions. They sell items to generate revenue, and the fact that someone else is buying them to resell could be seen as part of the market.\n\nSo, legally, the user isn't in the wrong. The store's action might be overreaching if there's no policy against reselling. Ethically, it's debatable, but legally, they're within their rights to buy and resell items they've purchased.\n"
