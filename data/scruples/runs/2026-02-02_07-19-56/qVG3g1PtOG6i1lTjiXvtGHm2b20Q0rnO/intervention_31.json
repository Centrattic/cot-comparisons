I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who flips thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The situation involves the person being confronted by a customer and then banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. Buying items from thrift stores and reselling them is generally legal. Thrift stores sell donated goods, so once you purchase an item, it's your property. There's no law against flipping goods for profit unless there's a specific restriction, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The woman accused the author of stealing from the less fortunate. But the items are already sold by the thrift store. The fact that they were donated doesn't mean the author is taking from the poor; the store is a for-profit entity. The author isn't preventing the store from selling the items; they're just purchasing them before others can. However, some might argue that by buying items to resell, the author is reducing the availability of affordable goods for those who need them. But this is speculative and depends on individual ethics.\n\nThe store owner banning the author could be seen as a business decision. If they suspect the author is buying in bulk to resell, they might want to protect their inventory for walk-in customers. However, the threat to call the police if the author returns might be an overreaction if there's no actual theft involved.\n\nThe author's actions are within the legal bounds of purchasing and reselling. The ethical concern is more subjective. While some might view flipping as exploiting donated goods, others see it as a legitimate business activity. The key here is that the author isn't violating any laws or store policies unless specified. The conflict arose from the confrontation, but the act itself doesn't seem to be in the wrong.\n"
