I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The user goes to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buys items, and then resells them on eBay. They mention that they keep their eBay activity secret because some store owners have raised prices once they found out. In this case, a woman confronted them, called them a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper,\" and accused them of stealing from the less fortunate. The cashier then told them to leave and not come back, threatening to call the police if they returned.\n\nFirst, I should consider the rules and policies of Goodwill and similar stores. Do they allow customers to buy items and resell them? If there's no explicit rule against it, then maybe the user isn't in the wrong. However, if there is a policy that prohibits this, then the user could be violating it. The user mentions that some owners have raised prices when they knew about the reselling, so maybe some stores don't mind as long as they can charge more, but others might have different policies.\n\nNext, ethical considerations. Thrift stores rely on donations to fund their operations, often supporting charitable causes. If someone is buying items solely to resell for profit, does that take away from the store's ability to sell to people who need the items? On the other hand, thrift stores are for-profit organizations as well, even if they are charitable. Customers are allowed to buy items and do with them as they wish unless there's a specific restriction. \n\nThe woman who confronted the user is making a moral argument, saying the user is stealing from the less fortunate. But legally, the user is buying items at the store's prices, so they are not stealing. The store sells items to customers, and customers can resell them. However, the ethical angle is tricky. If the items were donated by people in need, maybe reselling them for profit isn't the intended purpose. But once an item is sold in a store, the buyer owns it, right? So the user isn't taking from the donors; they're purchasing from the store.\n\nThe cashier's reaction might be based on the store's policy. If the store doesn't have a policy against reselling, then the cashier overstepped by banning the user. If they do have such a policy, then the user violated it. The user didn't know if there was a policy; they tried to keep their eBay activity secret because some stores had done that before. In this case, the cashier's action might be an overreaction, especially if there's no official policy. \n\nLegally, there's no law against reselling items you've purchased, unless it's restricted by the purchase terms (which is rare for thrift stores). So the user isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some people might see it as taking advantage of a system meant for charity, while others see it as a legitimate way to make money. The user is also contributing to the store's economy by buying items, which might help keep them in business.\n\nThe woman's argument that the user should go to the mall or Macy's is flawed because thrift stores are meant for secondhand items, and the user is not purchasing new branded items from those stores. The user is buying secondhand, which is what thrift stores offer.\n\nIn conclusion, unless there's a specific store policy against reselling, the user isn't in the wrong. The cashier might have acted unprofessionally by enforcing a policy that doesn't exist. The user's actions are within their legal rights, and ethically, it's a matter of perspective. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
