I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who writes the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The person is a thrifter who buys items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The situation escalated when a woman confronted them, leading to being banned from the store and a warning to call police if they return.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical and legal aspects here. Legally, thrift stores sell donated items, so buying them isn't illegal. The person is purchasing items they own, not stealing. However, the woman accused them of \"stealing from the less fortunate,\" which might be more about perception than legal fact.\n\nEthically, there's a debate. Thrift stores rely on donations to fund their missions, often helping low-income individuals. If someone is buying items to resell, they might be taking items that lower-income people might need or want. But others might argue that the items are already being sold at low prices and that reselling is a legitimate business.\n\nThe store owner banned the person and threatened police, which is a strong measure. The person wasn't violating any laws, so the store's response could be excessive. However, stores can set their own policies about who can shop there. The person might be exploiting a system where the intended beneficiaries are those in need, not profiteers.\n\nThe person might be in the wrong from an ethical standpoint because they're not the target audience the thrift store is trying to help. Even if it's legal, profiting from items donated for charity could be seen as misusing the system. On the other hand, the store didn't have a policy against reselling, so the person had no reason to know they couldn't do it.\n\nThe woman's confrontation and the store's reaction seem harsh if the person wasn't violating any rules. The person was honest after being called out, which might mitigate some blame. But the core issue is whether using donated items for profit is acceptable.\n\nI think the answer hinges on intent and the purpose of thrift stores. If the stores are for people to access affordable goods, then reselling isn't in line with that. The person's actions could be seen as undermining the store's mission, making them partially at fault. The store's overreaction is also questionable, but the person's intent might still be ethically questionable.\n"
