I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the thrift stores. The author mentions they try to keep their thrifting for resale a secret because some stores might raise prices once they know. So, maybe the store didn't explicitly prohibit buying items to resell. But the cashier told them to leave and threatened police if they return, which suggests that the store might have a policy against that.\n\nThen, the woman who confronted the author was upset, claiming the author is stealing from the less fortunate. But thrift stores are for-profit businesses that sell donated goods. The author is just purchasing items at retail prices and reselling them. The donated items are already sold by the store, so the author isn't taking them directly from the donors. \n\nThe cashier's reaction is a bit harsh. If the store's policy doesn't prohibit resale, then the author isn't breaking any rules. However, if the store has a rule against flipping items, even if it's not written, the cashier might enforce it. But the author isn't violating any laws here. \n\nEthically, some might argue that buying discounted items to resell is just capitalizing on a market, while others might see it as exploiting a system meant for helping others. But legally, unless there's a specific rule against it, the author isn't in the wrong. The cashier overreacted by threatening police, which might not be justified. \n\nSo, the answer is B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're within their rights to buy items and resell them unless a specific policy prohibits it, which the cashier might not have a right to enforce without clear rules.\n"
