I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The person got caught and banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, thrift stores sell items they've received through donations or purchases. Once you buy something from them, you own it. Reselling is generally legal, right? So the author isn't breaking any laws here. But the woman accused her of taking from the less fortunate. The donation aspect might complicate things ethically. The items were donated, and the stores rely on sales to fund their charitable missions. If someone buys donated items to resell for profit, does that harm the store's ability to help others? Maybe not directly, unless they're buying in bulk and driving up prices or depleting stock. The author mentions they keep it secret because stores might raise prices on them if they know. So there's an understanding that the stores don't want to be undercut.\n\nThe cashier banned the author, which is their right as a private business. But is the author wrong for doing this? Legally, no. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might argue that exploiting the system by buying low and selling high isn't fair to the stores' mission. Others might say it's a legitimate way to make money using available resources. The author's actions don't seem malicious, but the store's perspective is that their items are meant for the community, not for resale. However, the stores allow people to buy items, and reselling isn't prohibited unless there's a specific rule against it. The author didn't mention any such rule. \n\nSo the answer might depend on whether there's a rule in place. If the store doesn't prohibit reselling, then the author isn't in the wrong. The cashier's reaction might be overzealous, but the author isn't breaking any laws or clear store policies. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
