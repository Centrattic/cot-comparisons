I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for selling thrift store items on eBay. The situation involves the author buying items from thrift stores, which they then resell for profit. The key issue here is whether this practice is unethical or not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of thrift stores. They operate on donations, and their primary purpose is to sell donated goods to raise funds for their charitable causes. So when someone buys an item from a thrift store, they're purchasing it from the store, not from the original owner. The store has already accepted the donation, set a price, and decided to sell it. Therefore, the buyer doesn't have a direct ethical obligation to the original donor, as the item is no longer the donor's property once it's been donated.\n\nHowever, the author's actions might be seen as problematic from another angle. By flipping items for profit, they're taking advantage of the thrift store's pricing strategy. Thrift stores typically price items lower to make them affordable to a broader range of people. If the author is buying these items and reselling them at higher prices, they're potentially increasing the cost for people who actually need affordable clothing. This could be seen as undermining the store's mission.\n\nThe store employees' reaction is another point to consider. The cashier and the woman's accusations imply that the author is exploiting the system. The store's response to ban the author could be based on a policy against such practices, even if it's not explicitly stated. The woman's argument about taking from the less fortunate is a bit of a stretch since the items are donated and the store isn't a direct charity to the poor. But the perception is that thrift stores serve a community need, so flipping items might be viewed as going against that community support.\n\nLegally, there's no issue because the author is purchasing items lawfully. However, ethically, it's a gray area. The author is not stealing; they're buying and reselling. But the ethical concern is about exploiting the system for personal gain at the expense of others who might benefit more from the lower prices. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that while legal, the action is ethically questionable. The store's decision to ban the author suggests they don't want their items to be resold, possibly to maintain affordability and support their mission. Therefore, the author's actions, while not illegal, could be seen as ethically wrong because they conflict with the intended purpose of thrift stores.\n"
