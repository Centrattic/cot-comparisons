I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. They admit they've kept this a secret from the workers because they've had issues before with prices being raised once their intent was known. The main question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legally, thrift stores sell donated items. Once an item is sold to a store, it's their property to sell as they see fit. So purchasing items from them is legal. However, the store might not like people who buy to resell, especially if they feel it's unfair to other shoppers. The user is making a profit from items that were donated, which could be seen as exploiting the system. The woman who confronted them argued that these items are for the less fortunate, implying that the user is taking advantage of people who donated their items expecting others in need to benefit. \n\nEthically, this is a gray area. Some might say that the stores are meant to help those in need, and reselling is against that purpose. Others might argue that the stores are for-profit enterprises, and customers can buy items as they see fit. The user's actions could be seen as undermining the mission of the thrift stores, especially if the stores rely on donations under the premise that items will go to those who need them. However, the stores also sell to profit, so perhaps the user is just another customer. The cashier banning the user is a store policy decision, but it's not necessarily illegal. \n\nThe user's secrecy and the confrontation suggest that the store might not be comfortable with flippers. The woman's reaction was emotional, but the store's decision to ban the user is their right. However, the core issue is whether the user is in the wrong. Legally, no. Ethically, it's debatable. The stores accept donations expecting to sell them, and if someone buys directly, it's a transaction. But the user is taking advantage of a system designed to help others for profit. So maybe the answer leans towards the user being in the wrong ethically, even if not legally.\n"
