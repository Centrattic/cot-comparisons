I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. The scenario involves someone buying items from Goodwill to resell on eBay. The author is accused by a customer and then banned by the store. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, thrift stores sell their items to the public, so buying and reselling those items isn't illegal. The author didn't steal them; they purchased them. So legally, they're not in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's a bit trickier. Thrift stores rely on donations, and the purpose is to provide affordable goods to others. If someone buys items solely to resell at higher prices, that could be seen as undermining the thrift store's mission. However, thrift stores do sell to the public, and reselling is a common practice. Many people buy from thrift stores for personal use, but reselling is a gray area. \n\nThe store workers might have policies against this, but unless it's explicitly stated, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The cashier's reaction might be based on personal ethics rather than a store policy. Also, the author tried to hide their eBay activities to avoid higher prices, which might be seen as deceptive, but that's more about their own strategy than unethical behavior towards the items themselves.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong legally. Ethically, it's a matter of perspective. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because they're within their rights to resell purchased items. The store's policy might have banned them, but that doesn't make it right or wrong in a broader sense.\n"
