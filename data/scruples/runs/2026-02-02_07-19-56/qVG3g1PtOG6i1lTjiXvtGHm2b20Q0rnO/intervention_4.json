I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person buys items from thrift stores and sells them on eBay. The woman at Goodwill called them out as a \"flipper\" and accused them of stealing from the less fortunate. The cashier then banned them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, when you buy something from a thrift store, you own it, right? So technically, the author is within their rights to resell those items. Thrift stores know that people buy their products to resell; it's like a secondary market. So maybe there's no legal issue here.\n\nEthically, the woman's argument is that the items were donated and someone else might have wanted them. But thrift stores are set up to sell donated items. The stores profit from these sales, and the items are there for people to buy. If the author is just another customer buying what's available, how is that stealing? Unless the store has a policy against reselling, which the author didn't mention. However, the cashier banned them after the confrontation. Maybe the store doesn't like flippers because they're buying in bulk or driving up prices? But the author said they buy individual items. \n\nThe author mentioned they keep it secret because they've had prices raised when stores knew. That suggests that maybe some stores might not be happy about resellers, but it's not illegal. The cashier's reaction seems extreme, but maybe the store has a policy against reselling. However, the author didn't mention any such policy beforehand. \n\nSo, the author's actions are legal, but maybe ethically some people might feel it's taking advantage of donated items. But the stores themselves are set up to sell these items, so it's a bit of a gray area. The cashier's decision to ban them is their right, but the author didn't do anything illegal. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014author is not in the wrong.\n"
