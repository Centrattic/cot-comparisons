I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of the thrift stores. The author mentions they try to keep their activity secret because store owners might raise prices if they know. That suggests that the stores might not allow resale of their items, or at least want to prevent it. If the store's policy prohibits selling items, then the author could be violating that policy by reselling.\n\nHowever, in many places, buying items from a thrift store and reselling them isn't illegal. The stores sell the items to the public, so once you purchase an item, you own it and can do with it what you want. The key here is whether the store explicitly prohibits resale. If they don't have such a policy, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the store does have a policy against it, even if it's not stated clearly, the author could be in the wrong for violating that policy.\n\nThe customer confronted the author, calling them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" which are terms usually associated with reselling for profit. The cashier then told the author to leave and banned them from shopping there. This indicates that the store doesn't condone the practice, but it's unclear if they have a formal policy against it. \n\nLegally, unless there's a specific law against buying and reselling secondhand items, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the store's policy and ethical considerations might play a role. The woman who confronted the author argued that the author is taking items from the less fortunate, which is an ethical concern. Thrift stores often rely on donations to help causes like charity, so reselling could be seen as undermining that purpose.\n\nBut again, unless the store explicitly states that items can't be resold, the author's actions aren't illegal. The store can enforce their own policies, like banning the author, but that's their right as a business. The author isn't breaking the law, but they might be violating the store's rules, which is a civil matter, not a criminal one.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the store had a clear policy against resale, then yes, but if not, then no. Since the story doesn't mention a written policy, just the cashier's verbal reaction, it's more about the store's tolerance. The author's actions aren't illegal, but they might be violating the store's expectations. The woman's argument about taking from the less fortunate is an ethical stance, but not a legal one. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong legally, but may face consequences from the store. Answer B because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
