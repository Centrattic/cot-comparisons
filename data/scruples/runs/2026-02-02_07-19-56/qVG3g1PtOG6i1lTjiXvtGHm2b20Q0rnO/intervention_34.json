I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a thrifter who buys items from places like Goodwill and sells them for profit. They mention they keep it a secret to avoid being charged higher prices. Then, a woman confronts them, accusing them of being a \"flipper\" or \"scalper,\" and the cashier bans them from the store, threatening to call the police if they return.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). The person's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to hear my thoughts.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the ethics here. Thrift stores sell items that have been donated. The primary purpose of these stores is to raise funds for their respective charities. When someone buys an item from a thrift store, they own it and can do with it what they want, right? So reselling it isn't inherently illegal. However, there's an ethical angle here. The argument against the author is that by reselling, they're taking items that could have gone to people in need and instead profiting from them. The woman's argument is that these items were donated by those less fortunate, and maybe the people who donated needed the money from the sale to support their causes. But does the author have an obligation to the donors or the charity?\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't stealing. They're purchasing items at market price (though perhaps below retail). The stores sell to the highest bidder, and if someone else is willing to buy it from the author for more, that's their choice. The problem here is the accusation of exploiting the system. But legally, there's no rule against reselling items you've legally purchased. The cashier's action of banning the author might be based on store policy rather than legal grounds. The store could have a policy against resellers, but unless that's clearly stated, it might be a problem.\n\nHowever, the ethical question is more nuanced. The author is taking items that are meant to support charitable causes and using them for personal profit. That could be seen as going against the purpose of the thrift stores. But is that enough to say they're in the wrong? Or is it just a personal choice that others might disagree with?\n\nAlso, the cashier's response seems harsh\u2014banning someone for simply reselling. It's possible that the store has the right to set their policies, but if the author isn't violating any laws, the cashier's action might be questionable. However, the user is asking if they are in the wrong, which is a moral question, not just a legal one.\n\nSo, in terms of the AITA, the author's actions aren't illegal, but they might be ethically questionable. If the author is aware that their actions could be seen as exploiting the system and causing harm (by removing items from the shelves that could help the charity or be bought by those in need), then they might be in the wrong. But if they're just buying items that the store is willing to sell, then it's a matter of personal ethics.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are harmful. If the thrift store is losing potential customers or revenue by having items flipped, but since the author is buying from the store, they are contributing to the store's income. However, by reselling, they might be removing high-demand items, which could be a problem. But legally, there's no wrongdoing. So the answer might depend on the ethical perspective. If the community sees reselling as wrong, then the author is in the wrong. If not, then they aren't.\n\nThe original poster's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, which suggests that they believe the ethical angle outweighs the legal aspect. So, considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their actions, while not illegal, could be seen as ethically questionable, especially since they're aware of the purpose of thrift stores and the potential negative impact of their reselling.\n"
