I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sells thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores and reselling them for profit. The key points here are the ethics of reselling donated goods and the store's policies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the purpose of thrift stores. They are typically nonprofit organizations that rely on donations and sales to fund their charitable work. When people donate items, they expect those items to be sold at low prices to help others, not to be bought and resold for profit. So, by purchasing these items and flipping them for a higher price, the author is potentially undermining the store's mission. That could be seen as unethical because it's taking advantage of the system meant to help those in need.\n\nNext, the store's policies. The author mentions that they try to keep their buying habits secret because store owners might raise prices if they know. This suggests that the author is aware that the store might not approve of their actions. The store employee's reaction\u2014telling the author to leave and banning them\u2014indicates that the store has a policy against reselling. If the store explicitly prohibits this, then the author is violating those terms.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. While there might not be a law against reselling items you've purchased, stores can set their own rules. If the store bans resellers, the author can't shop there anymore. However, they can still do this at other stores unless they have similar policies.\n\nEthically, some might argue that reselling is a form of entrepreneurship and that the original donors aren't directly harmed. But others would counter that it takes away potential items from people who need affordable goods and that the stores lose revenue they could use for their charitable purposes.\n\nThe author's actions led to a confrontation and being banned. While they might not have broken any laws, they did violate the store's policies and likely the ethical expectations of the community. The store's decision to ban them is their right, given the policies they set. So, the author is in the wrong because they violated the store's terms and the intended purpose of the thrift store.\n"
