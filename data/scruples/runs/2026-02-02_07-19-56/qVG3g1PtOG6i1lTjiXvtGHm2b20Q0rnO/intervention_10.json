I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. \n\nFirst, the author buys items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. That's their hobby and a source of additional income. The key points here are the ethics of reselling thrift store items and the specific incident at Goodwill.\n\nThrift stores operate on donations. People donate items they no longer need, and the stores sell them to fund their charitable work. The author's action of buying these items and reselling them might be seen as undermining that purpose. But technically, when you buy something from a thrift store, it's a legal transaction. The store has sold the item, so the buyer has the right to do with it as they please, including reselling. \n\nHowever, there's an ethical angle. The woman who confronted the author argued that the items were donated by people in need, and by reselling, the author is taking money away from the charity. The cashier banned the author, probably because they felt the author was exploiting the system. \n\nNow, legally, the author isn't breaking any laws. They purchased the items through a legitimate sale. But ethically, some might argue that the author is not supporting the thrift store's mission. Thrift stores rely on low prices to serve low-income individuals, and if resellers are buying up desirable items, that could make those items less available to the intended customers. \n\nThe author tried to hide their reselling, which might imply they felt it was something they shouldn't be doing openly. The cashier's decision to ban them is a business choice, not a legal one. The store can set their own policies, and if they don't want resellers, they can enforce that. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no. Ethically, it's a gray area. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might disagree. The answer depends on whether the focus is on legality or ethics. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and in such AITA scenarios, the community often considers both legal and ethical aspects, there's a chance the answer is A, but some might say B. \n\nBut the cashier's action was a business rule, not a legal violation. The author isn't doing anything illegal. However, the ethical argument is that they're taking items meant for charity and profiting, which could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might be A, but it's not clear-cut. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. The assistant needs to decide based on the analysis.\n"
