I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The writer is called out by a customer and then banned by the store.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical aspects. Thrift stores sell donated goods, so is it wrong to buy them and resell for profit? Legally, when you buy an item from a thrift store, you own it and can do what you want with it, including reselling. So the person isn't breaking any laws here.\n\nThe store employee banned them, but unless there's a policy against reselling, the store can't really stop someone from buying items and reselling. But maybe the employee felt the person was exploiting the system? The moral argument is that donated items help fund the store's missions, so reselling might take away from that. But the person isn't taking donated items directly; they're purchasing them. The store gets the money, and the person is just reselling their own purchases.\n\nThe customer who confronted them was upset, thinking they were stealing from the less fortunate. But the items are for sale, so the author isn't taking them away from people who need them. The author's actions are legal, even if some people find it unethical. The store's policy might be an issue here. If they banned the person, maybe because they felt it's unfair, but if there's no policy against reselling, then it's not the author's fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong. Legally, it's allowed. Ethically, it's debatable, but not clearly wrong. The store's overreaction doesn't make the author at fault. So answer B.\n"
