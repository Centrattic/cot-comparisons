I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sells thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The situation is that the author buys items from thrift stores and resells them, which is a common practice. The key points here are the intentions of the author and the reactions of others.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they keep their eBay activity a secret from the store workers to avoid price hikes. This secrecy might be a point of contention. But is that inherently wrong? People often buy things to resell, and thrift stores sell items at lower prices, so maybe the author is just taking advantage of a business opportunity.\n\nThen, the woman confronts the author, calling them a \"flipper\" and accuses them of stealing from the less fortunate. The cashier then bans the author. The question is whether the author's actions are unethical. \n\nThrift stores are meant to help charitable causes by reselling donated goods. However, there's no rule against buying items from them to resell. The author isn't stealing; they're purchasing items at retail price. The woman's argument that the items were donated and meant for those in need is a moral stance, but legally, once the store sells an item, the buyer can do with it as they please. \n\nHowever, if the author is buying bulk items to resell, maybe the store sees it as a problem. But the store can't legally prevent someone from purchasing items and reselling them. The cashier banning the author without a valid policy might be overstepping. \n\nSo, legally, the author isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's debatable. But the question is about being in the wrong, which could refer to both legal and moral aspects. Since there's no legal wrong, and the author's actions are within their rights, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The cashier's reaction might be unjust, but the author isn't at fault for their actions.\n"
