I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The author is being called out by a customer and then banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. Legally, when you buy something from a thrift store, you own it and can do with it as you please, right? The items are already sold to the store by their previous owners, so reselling them isn't theft. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nEthically, though, there might be a debate. The idea is that thrift stores help people by providing affordable items and supporting charitable causes. If someone is flipping high-demand items for profit, it might be seen as taking advantage of that system for personal gain. But the author isn't stealing; they're purchasing items that others have donated. The argument made by the other woman is that the author is \"stealing clothes from the less fortunate,\" but since the items were already sold to the store, that's not accurate. \n\nThe cashier banned the author, but does the store have the right to do that? If the author is a regular customer, the store might not be happy about them reselling, but unless there's a policy against it, the store can't ban someone just for buying items. However, the store can set their own rules, so if they don't allow reselling, the author could be violating their terms. But the author didn't know about such a policy. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: legal ownership of the items, the purpose of thrift stores, and the store's policies. Legally, the author isn't wrong. Ethically, some might argue they are, but it's a gray area. The store's reaction might be harsh if there's no clear policy against reselling. The author was honest after being confronted, which is fair. \n\nSo considering all this, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The store's actions might be questionable if there's no policy against reselling. The ethical argument is there, but legally and in terms of standard practices, flipping thrift store items isn't inherently wrong.\n"
