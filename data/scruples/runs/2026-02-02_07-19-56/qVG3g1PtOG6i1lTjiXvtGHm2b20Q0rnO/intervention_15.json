I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong for selling items they bought from thrift stores. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person goes to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buys items, and sells them on eBay. They keep it a secret because they don't want the prices to be raised once the staff knows. Then, a woman confronts them, calls them out as a \"flipper\" or \"scalper,\" and accuses them of stealing from the less fortunate. The cashier then bans them and says they'll call the police if they return.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. Are there any laws against reselling items bought from thrift stores? Generally, when you purchase an item from a store, even a thrift store, you own it and can do what you want with it, including reselling. Thrift stores sell donated items, so once the store sells an item, the buyer has the right to resell it. So legally, the person isn't breaking the law.\n\nBut what about the ethical side? The woman claims the person is taking from the less fortunate. Thrift stores are non-profits that rely on donations and sales to fund their charitable work. If the person is buying items to resell, they might be reducing the number of items available for lower-cost buyers. However, the person argues that they are just buying what's available, and others might still buy those items. The question is whether it's ethical to do so for profit when others might need the items.\n\nAnother angle: the staff didn't like that the person was reselling because they raised prices before. So, maybe the person's actions could lead to higher prices for others. But if the store sells at a certain price, the person is free to buy what's available. It's a free market, but the staff's reaction might be based on their desire to keep items affordable for people who can't afford full prices.\n\nAlso, the cashier banned them, which might be their policy. But is that justified? The person isn't violating any store rules unless there's a specific policy against reselling. If the store didn't have such a policy, the cashier's action could be overstepping.\n\nPutting it all together, legally the person isn't in the wrong. Ethically, it's debatable. Some might argue they're profiting from items meant for charity, but others might say it's just buying and reselling. The staff's reaction could be based on protectionism, but unless there's a rule against it, the person isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be that the person isn't in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
