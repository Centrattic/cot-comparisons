I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores like Goodwill and then reselling them on eBay. The person was caught and banned from the store after a confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the store's policies. Thrift stores like Goodwill rely on donations to support their charitable missions. If the person is buying items to resell for profit, that might go against the intended purpose of these stores. The woman and the cashier were upset because they felt the items were being taken from people in need. The author admits they try to keep their flipping a secret to avoid higher prices, which implies they know it's not the norm.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. Thrift stores are supposed to help people who can't afford new items. If someone is buying the best items to resell, it could prevent others from finding good deals. However, thrift stores are for-profit entities as well, so maybe reselling is allowed. But if the store feels it's against their mission, they can enforce a policy.\n\nThe author was banned, which is the store's right. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, unless there's a specific policy against reselling, the author might not be in the wrong. But ethically, it's a gray area. The store's reaction is based on their mission. The author's actions might be seen as exploiting the system for personal gain, which could be considered unethical even if not illegal.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. If the store's policy explicitly prohibits reselling, then the author is violating it. If not, maybe not. But the store can still enforce a ban regardless. Ethically, it's a matter of intent. The author is making money off donated goods, which could be seen as taking from those who need it more. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from an ethical standpoint.\n"
