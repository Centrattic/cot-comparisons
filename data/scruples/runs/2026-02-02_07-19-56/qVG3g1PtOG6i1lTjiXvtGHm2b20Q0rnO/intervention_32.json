I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation. \n\nThe author goes to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buys items, and then sells them on eBay for extra income. They mention keeping their thrifting a secret from the store workers because they've had owners raise prices once they found out. Then, at a Goodwill, a woman confronted them, accusing them of being a \"flipper\" or \"scalper.\" The author admitted to having an eBay store, the woman made a scene, and the cashier told them to leave. Now the author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethics of reselling thrift store items. Thrift stores typically sell donated goods to raise money for their charitable causes, like Goodwill which helps people with jobs and training. If the author is buying items to resell, they might be taking the best items, potentially reducing the store's sales and thus the charity's funds. But is that unethical? Some might argue that the store is already selling donated goods as a business, and if the author is just another customer buying them, maybe it's not wrong. However, others might see it as exploiting the system meant to help the less fortunate, even if the author isn't stealing but purchasing legally.\n\nThe author's admission of running an eBay store could be an issue. If the store's intention is to support people in need, reselling for profit might go against that mission. Some stores might have policies against bulk buying or reselling, even if it's not explicitly stated. The cashier's reaction suggests there might be a rule they're enforcing, even if it's not written. \n\nAlso, the woman's argument that the author should buy from malls instead is a bit strange because malls are retail, not resale. But her point is that the author is profiting from donated items, which the donors intended to help others. If the author is buying items that someone in need could have purchased, that's a problem. However, thrift stores have a business model where they sell items regardless of the end use by customers. \n\nLegally, buying items from a store and reselling them is allowed under the first-sale doctrine. So the author isn't breaking the law. Ethically, it's more murky. If the author's actions are affecting the store's ability to fulfill its charitable mission, maybe there's an issue. But if the store is just a regular business selling secondhand goods, then the author's reselling is part of the market. \n\nThe cashier's decision to ban them and possibly call the police if they return is confusing. Unless there's a specific store policy against reselling, this might be overstepping. However, the cashier felt that the author was misusing the purpose of the store. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't legally in the wrong, but ethically, it depends on perspective. Some might see it as a fair market transaction, others as undermining the store's charitable intent. The store's reaction is questionable unless there's a clear policy. So I think the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
