I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The person was caught by a customer and then banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of reselling thrift store items. Thrift stores are nonprofit organizations that rely on donations. They sell items to fund their charitable work. When someone buys items from these stores and resells them for profit, they're essentially taking items that were donated for charitable purposes and using them for personal gain. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The items are donated to thrift stores, which means the original owners intended for them to support these organizations. \n2. By reselling, the person is preventing the thrift store from using the proceeds from the sale to fund their charitable activities. \n3. The thrift store may have a policy against this kind of behavior, especially if they've had past experiences where customers did this and it affected their revenue.\n\nThe woman who confronted the author argued that the person is \"stealing from the less fortunate\" by taking items meant for the thrift store's mission and profiting off them. The cashier then banned the author, which suggests that the store has rules against this. \n\nOn the other hand, thrift stores typically don't restrict customers from buying items and reselling them. It's not illegal, per se, but it's a matter of ethics. The author is being honest about their intentions, which might be seen as a problem if the store feels their mission is being undermined. However, unless there's a specific policy prohibiting resale, it's a gray area. \n\nBut in this case, the cashier did ban the author, indicating that the store has a stance against this. The author's actions might be seen as exploiting the system for personal gain, which isn't against the law but could be considered unethical. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong from an ethical standpoint, even if it's not illegal. The thrift store's mission is to support their charitable work, and the author's actions are hindering that. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
