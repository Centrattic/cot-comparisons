I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sells thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The situation involves the author buying items from thrift stores, which they then resell for profit. The key points here are whether this practice is considered unethical or if it's a legitimate business activity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies of the thrift stores. The author mentions that they keep their thrifting and reselling a secret because store owners might raise prices if they know. This implies that the stores might have rules against bulk buying or reselling, which their employees are aware of. If the store has such a policy, then the author could be violating their terms, which would make them in the wrong.\n\nNext, the woman who confronted the author accused her of stealing from the less fortunate. Thrift stores are usually non-profits that rely on donations to fund their charitable work. When someone buys an item to resell, they might be taking it out of the market where it could be sold at a lower price to someone who needs it. However, technically, the author is purchasing items that were donated, so it's not theft. The items are already in the store for sale, and the author is just a customer.\n\nThe cashier then banned the author and threatened to call the police if they returned. This might be an overreaction, but if the store's policy explicitly prohibits reselling, then they have the right to enforce that. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the store's mission by removing items that could be sold by the store to support their cause, thereby reducing the potential profit for the store and potentially the charity it supports.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is using a legal business model. Buying low and selling high is a common practice, and thrift stores are open to the public. However, the ethical consideration here is whether the author is exploiting the system. While it's legal, if the store's primary purpose is to help those in need by providing affordable goods, the author's reselling might be seen as taking advantage of that for personal gain, which could be viewed as unethical by some.\n\nThe woman's argument is that the author is not the intended customer. Thrift stores aim to serve people who can't afford new items. If the author is reselling to other people, perhaps at a higher price, they might be contributing to reducing the availability or increasing the cost for those who need it more. This could be a point in favor of the author being in the wrong from an ethical standpoint, even if it's not illegal.\n\nHowever, legally, as long as the store doesn't have a specific policy against reselling, the author isn't breaking any laws. The store sells items to the public, so customers can do with them as they wish. The cashier's threat to call the police is concerning because it's an illegal action to prevent someone from shopping unless there's a specific rule violation.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the store had a policy against reselling. If they did, then the author violated that policy, making them in the wrong. If not, then the cashier's actions might be excessive. But the author's decision to keep their eBay business secret suggests they know the store's disapproval. The ethical angle is tricky; while it's legal, the perception is that they're exploiting a charitable resource for profit, which might not be in the spirit of the store's mission. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong ethically, even if not legally. The cashier's overreaction is also a factor, but the main question is about the author's actions. Considering all points, the answer is A.\n"
