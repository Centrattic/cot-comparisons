I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what the situation is. They buy items from thrift stores and resell them on eBay. The key point here is that thrift stores sell donated goods. The store's policy might not allow resale of items, but the question is whether that's a problem. \n\nThe woman accused them of stealing from the less fortunate. But actually, the items are donated and sold by the store, so the person isn't taking them directly from individuals. The store is the one selling them. So legally, buying and reselling might be allowed unless the store has a specific policy against it.\n\nThe store employee kicked them out, so there's a conflict. If the store prohibits reselling, then the person might be violating store rules. But the store didn't mention that policy to them beforehand. However, the person was hiding their intent to resell, which might be unethical if the store expects customers to use items for personal use. \n\nEthically, some might argue that reselling donated goods could be seen as exploiting a system meant to help others. But others might say it's just a business opportunity since the items are for sale. The store makes money from selling items, so the person is just buying their items. \n\nLegally, unless there's a specific law against reselling thrift store items, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the store had a policy against it, then violating that policy could lead to being banned. \n\nSo, the person might be in the wrong if the store's policies prohibit resale, but if there's no such policy, they're not. Since the store didn't inform them of this policy, it's a bit unclear. But the store's employee decided to ban them, which suggests the store does have an issue with it. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a gray area. Some might see it as fair game since it's a free market, while others might find it unethical. The woman's accusation that they're stealing from the less fortunate isn't accurate because the store is selling the items, not the individuals. \n\nTherefore, the answer depends on the store's policies and whether the person knew about them. If the store didn't enforce such a policy before, the person might not be in the wrong. But if the store did have a policy and the person ignored it, they could be in the wrong. Since the person was banned, the store likely has a policy, so maybe they are in the wrong. But the store didn't clearly state it, so it's a bit of a tricky situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the person isn't legally wrong, and the store's policy might not be clear. However, ethically, there's a debate. But the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about right and wrong actions. Since the person didn't steal; they bought items legally, reselling them isn't inherently wrong unless prohibited by the store. The store's reaction might be based on their own rules, but the person isn't in the wrong in a broader sense.\n"
