I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they buy items from thrift stores like Goodwill and sell them on eBay. They keep it a secret because they don't want the store to raise prices. Then a woman confronts them, calls them a flipper, and the store owner kicks them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules and policies of the thrift stores. Do they allow customers to buy items and resell them? If the store doesn't have a policy against it, then it's probably okay. But maybe there's an unspoken rule or something in their fine print. The person didn't mention any specific policy, but the owner might feel that reselling is against their mission.\n\nThrift stores rely on donations to fund their charitable work. If someone is buying for resale, does that take away from the resources for those in need? But technically, the items are already sold, so the store gets the money. However, if the person is buying large quantities, it could be an issue. The story doesn't say they bought a lot, just a couple of shirts.\n\nAlso, the woman's argument is that the person is profiting from donated goods. But the store sells the items to make money. If the store is okay with selling to individuals, then reselling on eBay isn't their problem. However, if the store's mission is to provide affordable items to the community, then reselling might be seen as exploiting that system.\n\nThe store owner's reaction is to ban them and call the police if they return. That's a strong action. But unless there's a specific rule against reselling, the owner might be overstepping. However, as a private business, they can set their own policies. If the person is repeatedly buying and flipping, the owner might see it as a problem. But in this case, the person was caught once and banned.\n\nLegally, unless there's a contract or law against reselling, the person isn't breaking any rules. The store sold the item, so the buyer can do with it as they want. The moral aspect is debatable. Some might say it's taking advantage, others might see it as a legitimate business activity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the store doesn't have a policy against reselling, then they're not in the wrong. But if the store's mission is to help people by providing affordable goods, then the author might be seen as undermining that. However, the store's primary function is to sell items, so if they're selling to the public, then reselling isn't necessarily wrong. The owner's reaction might be based on their own interpretation, but unless there's a rule, the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
