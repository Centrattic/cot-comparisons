I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who buys items from thrift stores to resell on eBay is in the wrong. The person got caught and was banned from a Goodwill store after being accused of stealing from the less fortunate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. Thrift stores sell donated items, so buying them and reselling is legal. There's no law against purchasing items from retail stores, even if they were donated. So legally, the person isn't wrong.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The woman accused them of taking from the less fortunate. But thrift stores are meant for people to buy second-hand items at lower prices. If someone else wanted those Ralph Lauren shirts, they could have bought them before the person did. The person isn't preventing the items from being available since they're purchasing them, not stealing. However, some might argue that reselling for profit undermines the purpose of thrift stores, which are for affordable goods. But others might say it's a free market transaction.\n\nThe store's policy could be a factor. If they have a rule against reselling, then the person might be violating that. However, the user mentioned they kept their eBay activity secret to avoid price hikes, implying the store didn't prohibit reselling. The cashier's reaction was an overreaction, possibly based on the accuser's claims rather than policy.\n\nThe user's actions might be seen as exploiting a system where they can buy low and sell high. While not illegal, it's a matter of perspective. The accuser's anger is about perceived unfairness, but the user isn't taking from people\u2014they're just capitalizing on a market niche. \n\nIn conclusion, the person isn't in the wrong legally or ethically. The situation is more about differing opinions on resale and store policies. The cashier's decision to ban them might be based on misinterpretation or the accuser's influence rather than established rules. So the answer is B.\n"
