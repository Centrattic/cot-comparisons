I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. The author is a thrifter who buys stuff from places like Goodwill and sells it on eBay for extra income. They kept it a secret from the store workers because they were worried prices would go up once they knew. \n\nSo the situation is that at a Goodwill, a woman confronted the author, called them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" accused them of stealing from the less fortunate, and the store owner then banned them and threatened to call the police if they returned.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. The answer should be either A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethics here. Thrift stores sell donated goods. The author is buying items at thrift stores and reselling them. Is that unethical? Well, thrift stores sell their items to the public, so if someone buys an item from them, they own it and can do with it as they please. So legally, the author isn't doing anything wrong. They're not stealing; they're purchasing items at retail price and reselling them. That's a common practice, even if it's called \"flipping.\" \n\nBut the ethical angle is where the debate comes in. The woman's argument is that the author is exploiting donated goods for personal profit, taking items that might have been intended for people in need. However, thrift stores operate on the model that donated items are for sale, and the money goes to support their charitable missions. If the author buys an item at thrift store prices, they're contributing to that mission by purchasing it. The store benefits from the sale. The idea that the author is \"stealing from the less fortunate\" is a bit of a stretch because the items are already for sale. If the author didn't buy them, someone else would, and the store would still get the money. \n\nThe store owner banning the author is a bit more complex. If the store has a policy against reselling, then they can enforce that. But many thrift stores don't have such policies. The author didn't know the store had a policy against it, so they might be in the wrong if they didn't follow the rules. However, the store owner might be acting out of personal judgment rather than a formal policy. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, the author is within their legal rights. The woman's accusations might be based on a misunderstanding of how thrift stores operate. The author's secretiveness about their eBay store could be seen as dishonest, but it's not necessarily unethical. They might be trying to avoid higher prices, which could be a bit of a gray area. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author is not in the wrong. Ethically, there's a debate, but since the author is purchasing items legally and the store didn't explicitly prohibit reselling, they aren't in the wrong. The woman's actions and the store owner's reaction might be overreaching. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
