I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they buy items from thrift stores and resell them on eBay. The woman at Goodwill confronted them, calling them a \"flipper\" and a \"scalper,\" and the store cashier told them to leave and not come back, threatening to call the police if they return.\n\nFirst, I need to check the policies of thrift stores like Goodwill. Do they prohibit reselling items that they sell? From what I remember, Goodwill and similar organizations are non-profits that rely on donations to fund their programs. When you buy an item from their thrift store, you own it, right? So technically, you can do whatever you want with it, including reselling. But maybe the stores have specific rules against this. If the store allows customers to resell, then the person isn't in the wrong. If they have a policy against it, then the person might be violating that policy.\n\nThe person mentioned they keep their eBay activity secret to avoid higher prices. That suggests they know that if the store staff found out, they might treat them differently. Maybe the staff think reselling is unfair because the items are donated with the intention to help others, not for profit. But legally, once you purchase an item from a store, you have the right to resell it. However, the store can set their own rules about who they allow to shop there. If they have a policy against reselling, they can ban the person for violating those terms.\n\nThe woman's argument is that the person is taking items from the less fortunate. But thrift stores sell donated goods, and the proceeds go to support their mission. The person buying and reselling isn't taking from donors; they're purchasing items that the stores have already sold. However, the ethical angle is debatable. Some might argue that reselling these items is exploiting a system meant to provide affordable goods, while others might say it's just a legitimate business practice.\n\nIn terms of legality, unless there's a specific law against reselling thrift store items, the person isn't breaking the law. But the store can enforce their own rules. The cashier banned them, so if the store has a policy against reselling, the person might be in violation of that policy, even if it's not illegal. The question is whether the person is at fault in this situation. If the store's policy prohibits reselling, then the person is in the wrong for violating it. If there's no such policy, then the person isn't in the wrong. The user didn't mention if the store explicitly stated such a policy before, but the cashier's reaction suggests that they didn't want that practice. However, unless there's a written policy, it's hard to say. In many cases, stores can have their own rules and enforce them as long as they don't violate local laws. So the person might be in the wrong according to the store's policies, but not legally. Therefore, the answer might depend on the store's specific policies.\n"
