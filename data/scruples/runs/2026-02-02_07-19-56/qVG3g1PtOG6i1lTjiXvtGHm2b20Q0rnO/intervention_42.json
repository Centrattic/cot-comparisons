I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for selling thrift store finds on eBay. The situation involves the author buying items from thrift stores to resell, which they do as a hobby and for extra income. The key points here are the ethics of reselling donated goods and the store's policy.\n\nFirst, thrift stores rely on donations and the proceeds go to support their charitable missions. When someone buys an item and resells it for profit, they're essentially taking money that would have gone to the charity. So from a moral standpoint, some people might argue that's wrong because it undermines the purpose of thrift stores.\n\nHowever, legally, unless the store specifically prohibits reselling, the author owns the items they purchase. There's no law against buying something and reselling it. The store can have their own policies, but unless there's a sign stating that resale is prohibited, the author isn't breaking any laws. The cashier's reaction might be based on the store's policy, but the author might not have been aware of that policy or it might not be clearly communicated.\n\nThe author tried to be discreet to avoid price hikes in the future, which shows they're aware of potential issues. The woman's confrontation and the cashier's decision to ban the author are based on ethical concerns rather than legal ones. The cashier's threat to call the police if the author returns seems like an overreaction if there's no explicit policy against it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Ethically, some might say yes because they're profiting from items intended to support charitable causes. Legally, unless there's a specific policy against it, they're not. The question is whether the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The user mentioned they think the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions. \n\nBut the user is asking for my analysis. The answer hinges on ethics vs. legality. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering the context, the answer could be A (yes) because the author is taking advantage of the system intended for charity. However, others might argue B (no) because the author isn't violating any laws. But the cashier's policy might not be publicly stated, so the author wasn't explicitly informed. However, the cashier's action suggests the store's stance. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) genre, the community often considers ethical implications even if something isn't illegal. The consensus here might lean towards A because the author is exploiting a system meant to help others for personal gain, regardless of the legal standpoint. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
