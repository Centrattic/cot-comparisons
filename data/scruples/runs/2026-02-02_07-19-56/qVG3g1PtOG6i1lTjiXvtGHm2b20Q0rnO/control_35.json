I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe person is a thrifter who buys items from places like Goodwill and Salvation Army, then sells them on eBay for extra income. They keep it a secret because they\u2019ve had stores raise prices once they knew. Recently, a woman confronted them, called them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" accused them of stealing from the less fortunate. The cashier then told them to leave and not come back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let me think about the legality. Buying items from thrift stores and reselling is legal. Thrift stores sell donated goods, and once you purchase an item, it's yours to do with as you like, including reselling. So legally, the author isn't breaking any laws here. \n\nEthically, though, there might be some debate. The woman who confronted them argued that the author is taking items that might help others in need. The author is making money off of donated goods. But thrift stores themselves often rely on reselling these items to fund their charitable work. So if the author is buying from the store, the store still gets their money, which supports their mission. The author is just adding an extra step by reselling the items. \n\nThe cashier's reaction seems harsh. The store's policy might not prohibit reselling, especially since they sell items to the public. If the policy wasn't clear, the cashier overstepped by banning the author. The author didn't steal the items; they bought them like anyone else. \n\nThe woman's accusation that the author is \"stealing clothes from the less fortunate\" isn't accurate because the items were donated. The author is part of the resale economy, which is common. Many people buy cheap items to resell for profit. There's no indication the author is exploiting the system in a way that harms the store or the donors. \n\nHowever, the author might be taking advantage of the fact that donated items could be more affordable for lower-income people. But once the store sells the item, it's no longer meant to be affordable for everyone; the store's proceeds are what matter. The author isn't preventing the store from selling to others first. \n\nThe cashier's threat to call the police if the author returns is excessive. Unless there's a specific store policy against reselling, which wasn't mentioned, the cashier can't legally prevent someone from shopping. The author isn't doing anything illegal, so the store's reaction is unwarranted. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're engaging in a legal activity that's part of the marketplace. The confrontational woman and cashier overreacted without proper justification. The answer should be B.\n"
