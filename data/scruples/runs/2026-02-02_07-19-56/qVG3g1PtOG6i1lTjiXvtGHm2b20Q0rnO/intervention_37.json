I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects here. Thrift stores typically sell donated goods to make money, and their mission is often to support charitable causes. If someone is buying items from these stores with the intent to resell for profit, that could be seen as undermining the thrift store's purpose. The author mentions that they keep their eBay activity secret because they've had stores raise prices on them once they found out, which suggests that maybe the stores have policies against this.\n\nEthically, the argument is that the items were donated by people in need, and by reselling them, the author is taking advantage of a system meant to help others. The woman who confronted the author argued that the author is \"stealing clothes from the less fortunate.\" Even though the author is paying for the items, the items were meant to be sold at lower prices to provide affordable options for people, including those with lower incomes. By buying them and reselling at a higher price on eBay, the author might be removing items that could have been sold at the thrift store's lower prices, thus reducing availability for those who need affordable goods.\n\nLegally, the situation is a bit different. If the author is purchasing items from a retail store, they own those items and can resell them as they see fit. However, if the thrift store has a policy against reselling or if they have a clause in their terms of sale that prohibits this, then the author might be violating those terms. The cashier told the author to leave and to not return, which could be the store's way of enforcing their policy. But whether that action is justified legally depends on the specific policies and local laws. In many places, stores can ask someone to leave if they believe they are violating store policies, even if it's not a criminal offense.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical responsibility of the author. Even if it's legal, is it morally acceptable? The author is making money from items that were donated by people who might have needed the proceeds for the thrift store's charity. The author's action could be seen as exploiting a charitable system for personal gain. The confrontation at the store highlights the tension between personal profit and the intended purpose of thrift stores.\n\nThe author also mentions that they keep their eBay activity a secret because stores have raised prices when they found out. This implies that the store might view resellers as competitors, so they might adjust pricing to protect their own sales. The author's secrecy suggests that they know this is a gray area and are trying to avoid repercussions, which adds to the ethical complexity.\n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, the key factors are: the author's action (buying to resell), the store's policy, the donation aspect, and the impact on the intended beneficiaries of the thrift store. If the author is legally allowed to resell but is ethically violating the spirit of the thrift store's mission, then they might be considered in the wrong from a moral standpoint. If there's a clear policy against reselling, then the store's enforcement of that policy (even if not illegal) could mean the author is in the wrong in terms of adhering to the store's rules.\n\nConsidering all these points, while the author's actions might not be illegal, they could be considered ethically questionable because they're taking advantage of a system designed to support charitable causes. The store's policy and the confrontation with the customer and cashier indicate that the store and possibly the public view this as inappropriate. The author's decision to keep their activity secret further supports the idea that they recognize the ethical dilemma. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from an ethical perspective, even if not legally.\n"
