I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who flips thrift store items is in the wrong. The situation is that they buy items from thrift stores and resell them on eBay. They were caught and accused by a customer, leading to being banned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the terms of service of Goodwill or Salvation Army. Typically, thrift stores sell donated goods, and their mission is to generate funds for their charitable work. If a person is buying items to resell, they might be taking items that could have been sold by the store to fund their charities. So, in that sense, they might be undermining the purpose of the thrift store. \n\nBut on the other hand, thrift stores are open to the public. Unless there's a specific rule against purchasing items for resale, maybe it's not against the law. The stores might not have a policy prohibiting that. So the person isn't breaking a law, just possibly going against the spirit of the store's mission. \n\nThe cashier banned them, but legally, can a store ban someone for just buying items? If there's no policy against resale, the store might not have grounds to do that. However, stores often have the right to refuse service to anyone, so if they choose to enforce a policy against resellers, even if it's not legally binding, they can. \n\nMoral perspective: The customer argues that flipping donated items is taking from the less fortunate. The flipper might see it as a way to earn extra income. The ethical dilemma here is whether it's right to profit from items donated for charitable purposes. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the person is violating any rules or laws. If there's no explicit rule against resale, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the store's mission is to provide affordable goods to the community, then the flipper is arguably taking resources away from that purpose. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because unless there's a specific rule against resale, they're just using a legal purchase and reselling. However, the store can choose to ban them based on their own policies. So the person isn't necessarily wrong, but the store's action is within their rights.\n"
