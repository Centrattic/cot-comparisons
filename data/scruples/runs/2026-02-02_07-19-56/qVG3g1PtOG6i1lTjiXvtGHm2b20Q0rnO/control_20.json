I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sells thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. The situation is that they were caught by a customer and then banned from a Goodwill.\n\nFirst, I need to check the terms of service for thrift stores like Goodwill. I remember that many thrift stores don't allow reselling of items because they rely on donations and their mission is to help the community. If they found out someone is buying items to resell, they might consider that unethical or against their policies.\n\nThe author mentioned they kept their eBay activity a secret to avoid higher prices. That suggests they were aware that the stores might not approve. When confronted, they admitted to having an eBay store, leading to being banned. The cashier told them to leave and threatened police if they returned.\n\nNow, the key points: Is reselling thrift store items illegal? Probably not, since ownership transfers upon purchase. But ethically, it's a gray area. Thrift stores often rely on the idea that donated items help others, so taking them to resell for profit could be seen as going against that mission.\n\nHowever, the stores sell items to the public, so technically, anyone can buy them. The conflict here is between the store's policies and the customer's actions. The cashier enforced their policy by banning the author. Legally, the store can set their own rules, so they can ban someone for any reason, as long as it's not discriminatory.\n\nSo, the author isn't breaking the law, but they violated the store's policy. The question is whether they're in the wrong. Ethically, some might argue they're exploiting a system meant to help others. But legally, they're within their rights. The answer might depend on the ethical perspective. Since the user is asking if the author is \"in the wrong,\" which can be both legal and ethical.\n\nGiven that the store can enforce a ban, but the author didn't do anything illegal, the answer is more about ethics. However, in AITA (Am I the Asshole) terms, the community often considers intent and impact. The author's actions might be seen as unethical because they're profiting from donated items meant for others. So, the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
