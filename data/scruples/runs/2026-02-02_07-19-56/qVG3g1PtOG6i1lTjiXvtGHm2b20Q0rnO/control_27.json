I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for selling thrift store items they bought on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. When you buy items from a thrift store, you're purchasing them from the store, not directly from the donors. So the store has the right to sell those items, and once you buy them, you own them. Legally, reselling items you've purchased is generally allowed. So the author isn't breaking any laws here.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The woman who confronted the author argued that the items were donated for the purpose of helping others, and the author is taking them for profit. But thrift stores operate by selling donated goods to raise funds for their causes. If the store sells the item, they make money for their charity. The author is just buying items that the store already intended to sell; the difference is they resell them for a profit. However, the author doesn't take from the original donors directly, so maybe the ethics here are a bit murky. The author isn't preventing the store from selling the items; they're just buying them first and then reselling elsewhere.\n\nThe store's reaction is another point. The cashier told the author to leave and banned them. The store has the right to set their own policies, even if it's just a local one. If they don't want people buying items to resell, they can enforce that. Legally, they can't stop someone from purchasing items unless there's a specific rule against it. But in practice, stores can ask customers to leave for any reason. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but the store's policy could justify their actions.\n\nNow, considering the community perspective (like in an AITA scenario), people might have mixed feelings. Some might say it's okay because the author is just using the items they bought as they see fit. Others might feel it's taking advantage of the system meant to help others. However, since the author is buying from the store, not directly from donors, and the store's purpose is to sell items, the author isn't really violating the intended use of the thrift store.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong. The store can enforce their own policies, but the author's actions don't break the law or the store's inherent purpose. The woman's argument that the author is stealing from the less fortunate is a bit of a stretch because the store's sale is what funds their charitable work. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
