I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for selling items they buy from thrift stores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is buying items from thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, then reselling them on eBay. They mention keeping their reselling activity secret to avoid higher prices from store owners. The conflict arises when a customer confronts them, leading to being banned from the store.\n\nThe key points here are the ethics of reselling thrift store items. Thrift stores sell donated goods to fund their missions, which help the community. Reselling these items for profit could be seen as taking from people in need, as the stores rely on those sales for funding. However, the person argues it's a hobby that provides additional income. \n\nLegally, buying items from a store and reselling them isn't theft. The store sold the items to the person, so they own them. But ethically, it's a gray area. Thrift stores may view this as undermining their purpose. The store owner banned the person, which is their right if they set such policies. The woman who confronted them was defending the store's mission, while the person feels they're just using their resources.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, no. Ethically, it's debatable. The store owner can enforce their rules, but the act itself isn't illegal. The author might have been inconsiderate of the store's mission, but they weren't stealing. The answer would depend on whether the focus is on legal vs. ethical responsibility. Since the user asks if the author is in the wrong, and given that the store banned them for policy reasons, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because there's no legal violation, even if some view it unethically.\n"
