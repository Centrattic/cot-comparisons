I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who sells thrift store items on eBay is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person shops at thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buying items to resell on eBay. They mention that they keep their eBay activity secret because some store owners might raise prices if they knew. That's an interesting point because it implies that the stores might not be okay with people flipping items for profit.\n\nThen, the main incident happens. The woman catches the person in the act, calls them out as a \"flipper\" and \"scalper.\" The cashier then bans them from the store. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI need to consider the policies of thrift stores. Most thrift stores are non-profits, relying on donations to fund their operations, which in turn support various charities. If the person is buying items to resell, they're potentially taking items that were intended to be sold at low prices to fund these charities. That could be seen as undermining the store's purpose. However, technically, the stores sell items to the public, and there's no explicit rule against purchasing items to resell, unless the store has a specific policy against it.\n\nThe woman's argument is that the person is \"stealing\" from the less fortunate by taking items that could help them. But thrift stores already sell donated goods at low prices, so the items aren't being taken from the original donors directly. The original donors might not expect their items to be resold for profit, but the stores themselves are selling the items. \n\nThe cashier's action of banning the person suggests that the store has a policy against reselling, even if it's not explicitly stated. If the store owner feels that flipping items is against their mission, they have the right to enforce a policy to that effect. However, the person's actions aren't illegal; they're just purchasing items and reselling them. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? It's a bit of a moral dilemma. Legally, there's no wrongdoing because they're buying and reselling legal items. Ethically, it could be seen as taking advantage of the thrift store's purpose. If the stores are meant to provide affordable goods to the community, then reselling those items for profit might be considered against their mission. But the person isn't stealing; they're just buying items and reselling them, which is a common practice in many markets. \n\nThe key point here is whether the store has a policy against reselling. If they don't, then the person isn't in the wrong. But if the store does have such a policy and the cashier is enforcing it, then the person is in the wrong for violating the store's rules, even if those rules aren't clearly communicated. However, in many cases, these policies aren't clear, and the stores might not have a legal basis to ban someone for reselling unless it's explicitly prohibited. \n\nIn conclusion, the person might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically it's debatable. Since the cashier banned them, it's a policy issue, but the person might not have known about the policy. Therefore, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because their actions aren't illegal, though the store's policy might have been violated.\n"
