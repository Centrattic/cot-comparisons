I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who sells thrift store finds on eBay is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The person buys items from thrift stores and resells them online. They try to keep this a secret to avoid higher prices. A customer called them out, leading to a confrontation and being banned from the store.\n\nLegally, if the items are sold by the thrift store, then the buyer owns them and can resell as they wish. So the person isn't breaking any laws here. But the ethical question is trickier. Thrift stores rely on donations, and items are often sold at low prices to make them accessible. If someone is buying these items to resell at higher prices elsewhere, it could be seen as exploiting the system. It might reduce availability for people who need or want the items at lower costs.\n\nThe store owner banned them, possibly because they felt it's against the store's mission. The author's actions might be seen as unethical even if legal. But others might argue it's a legitimate side hustle, similar to how some people flip items for profit.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether one prioritizes the legal right to resell over the ethical stance of the thrift store's purpose. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, while others might disagree. The store's policy and the author's intent matter here. The author's decision to hide their eBay activity might have contributed to the conflict, but the core issue is the ethics of reselling donated goods. Considering the store's mission to serve the community, the author's actions could be viewed as going against that, making them ethically in the wrong. So, answer A.\n"
