I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about buying items from thrift stores to resell on eBay. The key points are: they buy items from thrift stores, keep it a secret to avoid higher prices, got caught by a customer, and were banned from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any rule against buying items to resell from these stores. Thrift stores are non-profits that rely on donations and sales to fund their operations. If they don't have a policy against reselling, then it's probably allowed. The person didn't mention any rules prohibiting this, so unless there's a specific rule they broke, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nNext, the cashier banned them from shopping. Is that justified? The cashier might feel that reselling takes items away from those in need, but unless the store explicitly prohibits it, the cashier doesn't have the authority to ban someone for buying items. Their role is to manage the store, not control who can purchase items unless there's a rule against it.\n\nThe woman who confronted them called them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" but those terms are more about ticket reselling. Using items for resale isn't the same. The cashier's reaction seems overly harsh without clear policy backing. The person wasn't stealing; they were purchasing items at retail price for resale. Unless the store has a \"no resell\" policy, the person is within their rights.\n\nAlso, the person tried to cover up but didn't lie. When confronted, they admitted to having an eBay store. The cashier's threat to call the police if they return is a heavy-handed response. Without a policy against reselling, the store can't enforce that. The person isn't taking donated items directly; they're purchasing them. So the person isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
