I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThey go to thrift stores like Goodwill and Salvation Army, buy items, and then resell them on eBay. They make some extra money from this. The key points here are that they buy from thrift stores and resell. The problem came when a woman confronted them, called them a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" accused them of stealing from the less fortunate, and the cashier then kicked them out and threatened to call the police if they returned.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. Do thrift stores have any rules against reselling items they purchase? Typically, when you buy something from a store, you own it and can do with it what you want, including reselling. So unless the store has a specific policy against resale, which the author might not have known, they're probably within their legal rights. The author mentions they try to keep their activity secret to avoid higher prices, which suggests that they're aware that some stores might not like it, but it's not necessarily illegal.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The woman and cashier were upset because the author is profiting from items that were donated. Thrift stores rely on donations, and the proceeds from selling these items go back into supporting their missions (like Goodwill's job training programs). If someone buys items cheaply and resells them for a profit, that could be seen as taking advantage of the donation system. But is it the author's fault? The author is a customer buying items at their listed price. They're not stealing or manipulating the system; they're just taking advantage of a market opportunity.\n\nAnother point is the cashier's reaction. The cashier told them to leave and threatened police if they returned. Is this a reasonable response? If the store doesn't have a policy against resale, then the cashier overstepped. But if there's a policy, even if not publicized, the cashier might be enforcing it. However, unless there's a law against resale, the cashier can't legally prevent them from shopping there again unless they're violating specific store rules.\n\nThe author's actions are within legal bounds unless the store had a specific policy they violated. The ethical issue is more about whether it's right to profit from donated goods. Some might argue that the original donors intended for the items to be sold cheaply for others to use, so reselling for profit is against that intent. Others might say that the author is just a customer exercising their right to resell.\n\nIn terms of the confrontation, the author was honest once confronted, which shows they didn't try to hide it. The cashier's threat to call the police if they return is a bit extreme if there's no legal grounds. However, the store could choose to ban the author for any reason, even if it's not illegal. So while the author isn't legally wrong, they might be considered unethical by some.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author is fine. Ethically, it's a gray area. The cashier's actions might be beyond their rights if there's no policy. The author's actions are not inherently wrong, but there's a social or ethical debate. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on legality/ethics. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which can include ethical considerations, but the options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the answer requires choosing between those, and considering that the author isn't breaking the law, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
