I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author buys items from thrift stores with the intention to resell them, which is essentially flipping. They mention that some stores raised prices once they found out, so they kept it a secret. The situation escalated when a customer confronted them, leading to being banned from the store.\n\nNow, the ethical angle. Thrift stores rely on donations and selling these items to fund their charitable work. If someone is buying items specifically to resell, they might be taking items that could have gone to lower-income individuals at a discount. The question is whether this practice is unethical. Some might argue that it's still a free market; the store is selling items at a price, and the author is purchasing them legally. Others might say that the purpose of thrift stores is to provide affordable goods to those in need, so reselling those items takes away an opportunity for that purpose.\n\nLegally, if the store didn't prohibit resale in their terms (which they might not explicitly state), the author isn't breaking the law. However, the store can enforce their own policies. In this case, the cashier banned the author, which is within their rights as a business. \n\nEthically, the debate is more about intent. The author is making money from items that were donated, which could be seen as exploiting a charitable system. But again, others might see it as a legitimate way to make income using available resources. The confrontation highlights the tension here.\n\nAlso, the author's secrecy about their flipping suggests they're aware of potential disapproval. The woman's accusation about stealing from the less fortunate is a strong ethical stance, implying that the author is taking advantage of a system meant to help others.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are considered unethical. If the store's primary purpose is to serve the community by providing affordable goods, then reselling those items could be seen as against that mission. However, if the store is a business selling goods, the author isn't inherently wrong. The key point is the store's policy and the ethical implications of reselling donated goods. Since the store banned them, it's clear the store has a policy against it, but ethically, opinions may differ. However, considering the intent to profit directly from donated items, the author might be considered in the wrong from an ethical standpoint.\n"
