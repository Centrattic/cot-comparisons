I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Thrift stores like Goodwill sell items that have been donated. When you buy something from them, you're purchasing it from the store, not taking it from someone else. So legally, unless there's a specific store policy against reselling, the person is allowed to buy and resell items. But the user mentioned that the store employees might raise prices if they know the buyer is reselling, which is a business practice but not illegal.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The woman accused the author of stealing from the less fortunate. But in reality, the author is buying items from a store, not directly from donors. The items are already sold at a discount, and reselling them can be seen as a personal entrepreneurial activity. However, some might argue that thrift stores exist to provide affordable items to people in need, so profiting from them could be seen as exploiting that system. But this is a point of contention.\n\nThe store's reaction is also important. The cashier told the author to leave and threatened police if they returned. This suggests that the store might have a policy against reselling, even if it's not explicitly stated. If the store doesn't allow resale, then the author could be violating their terms by doing so. However, if there's no such policy, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n\nAnother point is the author's secrecy. Hiding their intention to resell might be seen as deceptive, but it's a common practice and not illegal. People often buy items for resale without disclosing it, so while it's unkind to the store's interests, it's not unethical in a legal sense.\n\nThe emotional aspect comes into play with the woman's accusation. The author didn't take items from donors directly; the store is the middleman. So the ethical responsibility might not lie with the author but with the store's pricing and donation policies. However, the author is still making money from items meant for affordable access, which some might find morally questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, legally, the author is not in the wrong unless the store explicitly prohibits resale. Ethically, it's a gray area. The store's reaction is their policy, but the author's actions aren't inherently wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether the store's policy against resale is enforceable. Since the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the analysis shows it's more nuanced, I need to weigh if the author's actions are unethical.\n"
