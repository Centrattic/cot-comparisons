I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.  AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person in the story goes to thrift stores, buys items, and resells them on eBay. They were caught by a customer and then were told to leave the store and not return.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there's any rule against reselling items bought from thrift stores. Most thrift stores sell items that have been donated, right? The stores usually have the right to sell these items because the donors transfer ownership. So if someone buys an item from a thrift store, they own it and can do with it what they want, including reselling. Unless there's a specific policy that prohibits reselling, which I don't think is common. \n\nThen, the woman who confronted the person called her a \"flipper\" and \"scalper,\" but those terms are usually for people who buy limited items to resell at a markup, like concert tickets. Maybe that's not the same here. The person is just buying second-hand stuff and selling it for profit. \n\nThe cashier told her to leave and not return. That might be an overreaction. Unless the store has a policy against customers reselling, which isn't typical. Most stores don't mind, as long as you're buying the items. They sell them at a low price, so it's part of the market. \n\nAlso, the person was trying to keep their reselling a secret to avoid higher prices, which implies that the stores might adjust prices if they know customers are reselling. But that's more about the store's policy than the buyer's right. \n\nSo, unless the store explicitly prohibits reselling, the person isn't in the wrong. The store's reaction might be unfair, but the person's actions seem legal. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
