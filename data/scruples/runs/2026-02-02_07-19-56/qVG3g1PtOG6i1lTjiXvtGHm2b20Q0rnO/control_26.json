I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for selling items bought from thrift stores. The writer goes to thrift stores, buys stuff, and resells it on eBay. Yesterday, a woman confronted them, called them out as a \"flipper\" or \"scalper,\" and accused them of stealing from the less fortunate. The cashier then banned them from the store.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the ethics of reselling items purchased from thrift stores. Thrift stores typically sell donated goods, and the proceeds go to support the organizations. The author is buying items from these stores and reselling them for profit. The main issue the woman raised is that the author is taking items that might have been donated by people in need and then profiting from them, which could be seen as exploiting the system. However, legally, once an item is sold at a thrift store, the buyer owns it and can do with it as they please, including reselling. \n\nBut there's a moral angle. The stores rely on donations and their mission is to help communities. If the author is buying large quantities to resell, that could reduce availability for lower-income shoppers and undermine the stores' purpose. However, the author mentions they try to keep their thrifting secret to avoid price hikes by store owners. The conflict here is between the author's right to resell and the potential negative impact on the stores' mission.\n\nThe cashier's reaction was to ban the author, which is the store's policy. Legally, the store can set their own rules, so the cashier was within their right to ask the author to leave. However, the author isn't breaking any laws by reselling. So, the author isn't in the wrong legally, but there might be a moral or ethical debate. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not just about the legality but the ethics. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider both legal and moral aspects. The author's actions are legal but might be seen as unethical by some because they're removing items that could help others. However, others might argue that thrift stores are for sale, and buying and reselling is part of the free market. The woman's argument that the author should go to the mall instead misses the point because the author isn't stealing from individuals; they're purchasing from stores. \n\nThe cashier's decision to ban the author is based on store policy, which might not have been communicated beforehand. The author didn't know they couldn't resell items bought from that store. So, while the store can enforce their policies, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong beyond that policy violation. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't breaking any laws, but the store can enforce their own rules. The ethical stance is subjective. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the focus is on legal/moral aspects. Given that, the answer is likely B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong legally, though there's a moral debate.\n"
