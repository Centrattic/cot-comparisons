I go to Goodwills, Salvation Armys, thrift stores, etc. and I buy stuff from there to sell on my Ebay account.  Not only is it a little hobby I enjoy, it also brings in some nice additional income and play money.  Yesterday I was at a Goodwill I go to quite frequently.  (Note: I try to keep the fact that I\u2019m a thrifter a secret to the workers at the stores because I\u2019ve had owners raise their prices on me once they knew I buy their items to sell.) I was walking around with a few nice Ralph Lauren shirts that are size 2XL that obviously were too big for me but I knew they would sell.  A woman came up to me and asked if I was seriously going to buy the shirts for myself.  I tried to give my usual coverup answer of \u201cI\u2019m buying them for a friend\u201d or \u201cfor a family member.\u201d  She immediately called my bluff and called be out calling me a \u201cflipper\u201d and a \u201cscalper.\u201d  I wasn\u2019t going to lie to her twice so I did tell her I have a small Ebay store.  That\u2019s when she got angry.  She started to make a scene saying how \u201cI\u2019m stealing clothes from the less fortunate and selling them solely to my own benefit\u201d and \u201cIf I want to buy big name brands to sell, go to the mall and Macy\u2019s.\u201d  The cashier/owner came over to see what all this woman\u2019s hollering was all about and she told her all about how I\u2019m trying to profit off of things that were donated and taking things from people who would have actually wanted to own the item yadda yadda yadda.  The cashier looked over at me and after a second, she told me to give her the shirt and leave and I wasn\u2019t allowed to shop at the store anymore and if I come back, they\u2019d call the police.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who writes the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves buying items from thrift stores and reselling them on eBay. The person has been doing this as a hobby and a way to make extra money, but they got caught by a customer who accused them of stealing from the less fortunate and scalping. The store employee then banned them and threatened police if they return.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the act of buying second-hand items and reselling them is unethical. Thrift stores sell donated goods, so when items are donated, they become the property of the store. Purchasing those items is a legitimate transaction. The person is not stealing; they are buying something that's up for sale. Therefore, reselling it could be seen as a normal part of the market. However, some might argue that the purpose of thrift stores is to provide affordable goods to those in need, so reselling could drive up prices. But legally and ethically, as long as the person is buying items at retail price and not taking more than is allowed, there's no clear wrongdoing.\n\nThe woman who accused the person called her a \"flipper\" and \"scalper.\" The term \"flipper\" is often used in the resale market, like for sneakers or limited items, but in the context of thrift stores, maybe it's considered different. Scalping usually refers to buying up limited items to resell at higher prices, which can be seen as exploitative. However, in this case, the items are mass-donated and available for anyone to buy. If the store isn't restricting the number of items someone can purchase, then the person isn't violating any rules.\n\nThe cashier told the person to leave and banned them. If the store has a policy against bulk buying or reselling, that's their right. But if there's no such policy, the store's action might be excessive. The person wasn't stealing; they were a customer who was caught reselling. The store's response could be based on a misunderstanding or the customer's accusations.\n\nLegally, the person isn't doing anything wrong unless there are specific store rules against reselling. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might say thrift stores exist to give people affordable goods, so taking items to resell could reduce availability for those who need them. Others argue that it's a free market and the store is selling their inventory to whoever, so the buyer can do what they want with it.\n\nThe person was keeping their resale activity secret to avoid price hikes, which seems like a business strategy rather than unethical. The cashier's decision to ban them without a clear policy might be the store overreacting. The police threat seems extreme unless there's a theft charge involved, but since they paid for the items, that's not the case.\n\nIn conclusion, the person isn't in the wrong. The store's actions were possibly based on a misunderstanding or the other customer's accusations without valid grounds. The resale of purchased goods is a legal business practice unless prohibited by specific store policies, which weren't mentioned here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
