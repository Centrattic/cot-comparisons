I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. The author argues that since he makes four times her income, he's funding most of the household, so he expects her to handle more chores and child care. The question is whether this expectation is fair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on domestic responsibilities. In many relationships, there's an unspoken or spoken agreement about how to divide chores and childcare. Some couples split them equally, some divide based on the time each has available, or other factors. The author is suggesting a division based on income, but that's not a common approach. Usually, it's more about time or ability rather than financial contribution. \n\nThe author's argument is that since he's providing most of the income, his wife should take on more of the non-financial responsibilities. But in reality, both partners contribute in different ways. Income is one part, but emotional labor, childcare, and household management are also significant. Expecting a spouse to take on more chores just because you earn more could be seen as assuming their role is to manage the household in exchange for your financial support. That might perpetuate traditional gender roles where the higher-earning partner (often the man) expects the other to handle domestic duties. \n\nMoreover, the author mentions \"management\" and the \"bulk\" of child work and housework. This could imply an unequal distribution of labor, which might be unfair. Even if he's earning more, both partners are living in the same house and benefiting from the same environment. The idea that one person's contribution (income) justifies another's (chores) might not balance out the shared responsibility of maintaining a home. \n\nAlso, the author's tone suggests that his wife isn't doing her fair share, leading to constant disagreement. It's possible that their communication isn't aligned on expectations. The author is making assumptions about what's fair based on income, while the wife might have different views or might feel overwhelmed. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's often considered that both partners should contribute equitably to household tasks, regardless of income. So expecting more chores from the lower-earning partner might actually be the opposite of what's fair. The author's reasoning might be rooted in traditional gender roles rather than mutual agreement. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's imposing an expectation based on income rather than mutual effort or communication. It's important for couples to discuss and agree on how to divide responsibilities in a way that feels fair to both, not just based on financial contributions.\n"
