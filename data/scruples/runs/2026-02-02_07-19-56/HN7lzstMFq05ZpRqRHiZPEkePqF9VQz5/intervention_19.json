I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who earns four times as much as his wife and expects her to take on more housework and childcare. He's asking if it's unfair to expect that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core of the issue. The husband's argument is that since he contributes more financially, he expects his wife to handle more domestic responsibilities. However, this seems like a common dynamic that can lead to resentment. But is it fair? \n\nI should think about societal norms and expectations. Traditionally, there was an assumption that the higher earner handles financial responsibilities while the lower earner manages the home. But modern relationships often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of income. So maybe the husband's reasoning is outdated.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved. Even if one person earns more, managing the household, keeping track of schedules, and handling childcare are significant tasks that can be as demanding as a job. If the wife is doing most of that, it's a valid expectation that the husband should share the load more equitably. \n\nThe husband's argument that his financial contribution justifies his wife doing more housework might overlook the fact that both financial and domestic contributions are essential to the household. They should be shared based on mutual agreement and capability, not just income disparity.\n\nAlso, the mention of the child adds another layer. Childcare and housework are not just chores; they're responsibilities that both parents can and should share. Assuming the wife should handle all of that solely because she earns less could be seen as unfair, as it may limit her career growth or personal time.\n\nI should also consider if there's any mention of prior agreements. The post doesn't state whether they discussed and agreed on these roles. If they never had that conversation, the husband's expectations might be unspoken and thus unfair to the wife. Communication is key in such matters.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's reasoning seems flawed because it's based on the outdated notion that income directly correlates with household responsibilities. Modern, equitable relationships often require both partners to share responsibilities regardless of earnings. The author is likely in the wrong for expecting more domestic work from his wife based on her lower income without mutual agreement. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
