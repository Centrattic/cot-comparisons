I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author makes almost four times what his wife does. He's saying that since he's the main earner, she should handle more of the domestic tasks. But is that fair? Well, I think it's a common assumption that the higher earner should take on more responsibility, but maybe that's a traditional view. \n\nWait, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The author is arguing that he's covering most of the financial responsibilities, so she should take on more of the non-monetary responsibilities. But does income directly translate to an obligation to contribute to household chores? Maybe not. Housework isn't just about money; it's about shared responsibility and fairness in the relationship.\n\nAlso, having a child adds to the workload. Both parents are responsible for the child's needs, regardless of income. The author might be trying to shift the burden of chores onto his wife, which could be seen as unfair. It's possible that the wife is working, so even though she earns less, she's still contributing, and expecting her to do more chores without considering her time or effort could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author is funding most of the operation, but that's a financial contribution. Housework and childcare are different. They require time and energy. Assuming that because he's paying the bills, she should handle the rest might not be equitable. Relationships should ideally balance both financial and domestic contributions, but everyone's circumstances are different.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks so. I need to decide between A or B. The key point might be whether expecting someone to do more chores based on the other's income is fair. Traditional gender roles might have supported this view, but modern relationships often emphasize equality regardless of income. So, the author's reasoning might be outdated or unfair. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
