I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person writing the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a husband who earns four times more than his wife. He's asking if it's unfair to expect his wife to take on more housework and childcare, arguing that since he's the main financial provider, she should contribute more in other areas.\n\nHmm. So, the user already thinks the author is in the wrong, and wants confirmation. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the core issue here is the assumption that the wife should do more housework and childcare because the husband earns more. Let's break this down. In many relationships, especially traditional ones, there's an idea that the higher earner should handle the bills while the other manages the home. But that's a traditional view and might not align with more modern, equitable approaches to partnerships.\n\nThe author's logic is that since he's funding most of the household, his wife should handle the domestic tasks. But this seems to imply that contributing financially equals less responsibility at home. That can create an imbalance. Even if one partner earns more, sharing household responsibilities is important for a balanced relationship. The author is not considering that his wife might have her own career or responsibilities, and that contributing to the household isn't necessarily tied to income.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof...\" sounds a bit condescending. It suggests that without his income, they couldn't survive, which might undermine his wife's contributions. This could be a power dynamic issue, where the author is trying to assert control or justify his stance by emphasizing his financial role.\n\nAnother angle: the workload of childcare and housework is often undervalued. Even if someone isn't earning as much, taking care of the home and children is a full-time job. The author is expecting his wife to do the bulk of that, but he's not considering that she might be juggling work and home, or that he's not contributing enough at home. The fact that they have a child adds to the workload, so teamwork is crucial.\n\nThe author's approach might be leading to constant disagreements, which indicates a problem in communication. Instead of expecting his wife to manage everything, maybe they should be discussing how to divide responsibilities based on their strengths and availability, rather than income. The assumption that income directly correlates to domestic duties isn't necessarily valid in a modern, equitable relationship.\n\nIn summary, the author is in the wrong because he's placing an unfair expectation on his wife based on his income, not considering the value of her contributions and the need for shared responsibilities. The answer should be A.\n"
