I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is making four times what his wife does and expects her to take on more housework and child duties because he's funding most of the household. The question is whether he's wrong for this expectation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband is contributing more financially, but he's arguing that this entitles him to expect his wife to handle more domestic responsibilities. However, traditional gender roles might influence his perspective here. In modern relationships, many people advocate for an equal partnership regardless of income, where both partners contribute to household chores and childcare based on their availability and strengths, not necessarily tied to who earns more.\n\nThe wife's lower income might be due to various reasons, like choosing a part-time job to manage family responsibilities. If the husband is using his higher income as a justification for her doing more housework, that could be seen as unfair. It's important to recognize that emotional labor, which includes managing schedules, planning, and organizing, is also a significant part of household work and should be shared equitably.\n\nThe husband's argument that \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" implies a sense of ownership over the household's stability, which might be undermining his wife's contributions and autonomy. Equality in partnership isn't always about splitting tasks 50-50 but about mutual respect and considering each other's workloads. Expecting her to do more just because he earns more could lead to resentment on both sides.\n\nMoreover, the husband is framing this as a matter of fairness based on income, but fairness in relationships often involves empathy and understanding each other's circumstances. If the wife is handling the bulk of child care and housework, that's a substantial contribution that shouldn't be discounted just because the financial support comes from his income. They might need to communicate better and find a balance that works for both, rather than using income as a metric for responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning is flawed because equating financial contribution with domestic responsibility can lead to an unequal partnership. The husband is in the wrong by expecting his wife to take on more based on his higher income, which overlooks the importance of shared responsibilities and mutual respect in a relationship.\n"
