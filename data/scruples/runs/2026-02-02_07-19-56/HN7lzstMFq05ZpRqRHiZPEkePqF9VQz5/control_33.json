I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework and childcare because they earn four times more. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this topic. Many people believe that in a relationship, responsibilities should be shared equally regardless of income. So even if one partner makes more, the expectation of equal contribution in domestic tasks is often seen as fair. The author is assuming that higher income translates to less responsibility at home, which some might view as outdated or unfair. \n\nBut then there's the other side. If one partner is bringing in most of the income, maybe the other can take on more at home. However, this can lead to stereotypes and might not account for the wife's own contributions, like managing the household, which can be full-time work. Also, the author mentions \"management\" as a role, but that's still part of the household duties and doesn't necessarily have to be split based on income.\n\nI should also think about the fact that the wife is contributing in her own way, perhaps her job allows for more flexibility. But the user is framing it as \"expecting her to do more,\" which implies an imbalance. The key point here is the assumption that financial contribution should dictate the division of labor. \n\nIn many modern discussions, emotional labor and childcare are considered equally important. So expecting the wife to handle most of that just because she earns less might be seen as unfair. The author might be overlooking the value of the tasks the wife is already doing. Also, the argument that \"without me, she couldn't pay for things\" suggests a lack of teamwork in the relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the wife might be working part-time or in a job that doesn't pay as much but could still be demanding. The author's expectation could be placing an undue burden on her. The phrase \"bulk of the child work and housework\" is concerning because it implies the majority, which might not be balanced. \n\nSo, based on this, the author's reasoning is likely considered wrong (A) because the division of household responsibilities isn't typically based on income. Instead, it's about mutual agreement and shared effort. The author is making an assumption that links income to domestic duty, which many would argue isn't the right approach. The answer would be A.\n"
