I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework since they earn more. The user thinks the author is wrong, but they want to see what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here: sharing of domestic responsibilities based on income. The author argues that because they contribute more financially, their wife should take on more of the household and childcare duties. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that since the author is earning more, they should be able to hire help or take on more responsibilities themselves.\n\nIn many relationships, the division of labor isn't solely based on income. It's often about what each partner can do given their time, energy, and other commitments. If the wife is working, even if it's less, she's still contributing, and expecting her to manage everything could be seen as unfair. Also, the assumption that higher income directly translates to a partner's ability or obligation to handle more chores might not hold. Financial contributions don't necessarily determine how responsibilities should be split. It's more about mutual respect and understanding each other's contributions, both paid and unpaid.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved in managing household tasks and childcare. That's a significant part of domestic work, and if the author is expecting their wife to handle that, they might not be considering the mental and emotional toll it takes. It's possible the author isn't contributing enough to those areas, leading to the wife feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe question also mentions that the author's wife is the one who \"manages everything,\" which could imply that she's handling not just physical chores but also the coordination and planning. If the author isn't stepping in to help with that, it's an imbalance. The argument that if not for the author's income, the family couldn't survive, overlooks the fact that both partners have responsibilities beyond just financial contributions.\n\nCultural norms might also play a role here. In some societies, the higher-earning partner is expected to take charge of certain aspects, but this is changing. Modern relationships often emphasize equality in chores regardless of income. The key is communication and negotiation based on each partner's circumstances rather than a strict ratio tied to earnings.\n\nIn summary, the author's expectation that their higher income justifies their wife doing more housework could be seen as unfair. The division of labor should be based on mutual agreement and shared responsibilities, not solely on financial contributions. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
