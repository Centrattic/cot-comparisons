I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times her income. The question is whether it's fair to link income to household responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the premise that higher income automatically justifies a lower share of chores. The author argues that since he's funding most of the household, his wife should handle more of the domestic tasks. But I wonder if that's a valid assumption. Does higher income inherently mean one is less capable or available to do chores? Or is this a traditional gender role assumption?\n\nThen, there's the aspect of parenting. The child-related tasks are mentioned. The author seems to think that his wife should take the \"management\" role, which might imply she's in charge of organizing everything. But parenting isn't just about who manages; it's about shared responsibility. Maybe both partners should be involved equally, regardless of income.\n\nAnother angle is the contribution of emotional labor. Even if one person earns more, they might still have emotional labor demands. The author might be underestimating the mental load his wife carries. Dividing chores based on income could lead to imbalance in other non-monetary ways.\n\nAlso, societal expectations might play a role here. Historically, women have been expected to handle more domestic work even when working outside the home. The author might be perpetuating that stereotype by expecting his wife, who earns less, to take on more chores. But is that fair? Probably not. Fairness should be based on mutual agreement and what each partner can manage, not income.\n\nThere's also the impact on their relationship. Constant disagreement over chores can lead to resentment. The author's approach might be contributing to the conflict. Instead of assigning chores based on income, a more equitable approach would be to communicate and divide tasks based on each person's strengths, time availability, and preferences.\n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, the author is funding most of the household, but money isn't the only contribution. Time and effort in domestic tasks are also important. The assumption that one person's financial contribution negates their need to contribute in other ways is flawed. A healthy partnership requires both partners to contribute in ways that are meaningful to the household's well-being.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely assuming a traditional role where his wife should handle more chores because he earns more. This is a common but outdated perspective that doesn't consider equal partnership. The key issue is whether the division of labor is fair and agreed upon by both parties, not based on income. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making this assumption and expecting his wife to take on more without mutual agreement.\n"
