I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework since he earns more. The question is whether it's fair to link income to household responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general societal norms. Traditionally, there's been an expectation that the higher-earning spouse might take on more financial responsibility, but household duties are often split based on other factors like time availability, personal preferences, or shared responsibilities. However, modern views often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of income.\n\nThe author argues that since he makes four times more, his wife should handle more chores and child care. But does income directly correlate to how much someone should contribute to chores? Maybe not. Many people believe that chores and child care should be shared equitably, not based on income. The idea that one person's contribution is more valuable just because they earn more can be problematic. It might lead to an imbalance where the lower earner feels they're not contributing enough, even if they're doing more at home.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that without his income, they can't afford things. But he's forgetting that his wife's income does contribute, even if it's less. It's possible that she's working, and managing a job while handling most of the housework and child care is a significant workload. The author might not be acknowledging her contributions beyond just income.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The user says this is a constant disagreement. Maybe the root issue is not about fairness based on income but about differing expectations. They might need to discuss their needs and find a balance that works for both, rather than using income as a justification.\n\nThere's also the aspect of gender roles. If the wife is doing more of the housework and child care, it could be perpetuating traditional gender roles where women are expected to manage the home regardless of income. This might not be fair or equitable in a modern context where both partners are working.\n\nIn conclusion, the expectation that someone should do more chores because they earn less isn't fair. Household responsibilities should ideally be shared based on what each person can contribute, considering their work hours, preferences, and other factors. The author's reasoning is flawed because it ties chores to income, which isn't a standard approach in equitable partnerships. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
