I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The author makes four times what their wife does and wants her to handle more chores, management, and childcare. They think since they pay most of the bills, the wife should contribute more at home.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider societal norms and expectations around domestic responsibilities. Traditionally, there's been an idea that the higher-earning partner should have more financial responsibility, but the other partner handles the home. But these days, people are moving towards more equality. \n\nThe key point here is the assumption that because the author contributes more financially, the wife should take on more household tasks. But does financial contribution equate to less responsibility at home? Not necessarily. Many argue that both partners should share household duties regardless of income. The author is essentially saying that since they earn more, the wife's contribution should be in other areas. However, this could be seen as unfair because they might be taking on the majority of childcare and housework, which is a significant part of domestic labor.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their child. Childcare responsibilities are often split unevenly even when parents have different incomes. But expecting the lower-earning partner to handle most of the childcare and housework might not consider the value of that work. It's important to recognize that housework and childcare are essential and time-consuming, even if they don't generate income.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is making a financial argument. But if the wife's income is lower, maybe she's working part-time or has career sacrifices due to childcare, which the author isn't acknowledging. So, there might be an imbalance there too.\n\nThe question is whether expecting the wife to do more because the author earns more is fair. The answer would depend on mutual agreement and understanding. If this is a point of constant disagreement and resentment, it's a problem. The author might be in the wrong because they're not considering the wife's perspective and the effort she's putting into managing the household, even if it's less than expected. It's possible the wife is already doing her share, and the author's expectation is causing conflict without mutual discussion.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They're not considering that domestic responsibilities should be shared equitably, not divided based on income. The financial contribution doesn't absolve them of their own responsibilities at home. Both partners should contribute according to their abilities and agree on a fair division, rather than one expecting more based on earnings.\n"
