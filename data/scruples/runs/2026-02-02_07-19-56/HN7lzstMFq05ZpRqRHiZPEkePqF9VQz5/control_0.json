I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn four times her income. The question is about fairness and expectations in domestic responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and the ethics of dividing chores based on income. Traditionally, some people believe that the higher earner should take on more financial responsibility, while the lower earner handles more domestic tasks. However, modern perspectives often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of income. \n\nThe author argues that since he earns more, his wife should manage the household and child-rearing. But this line of thinking might not account for the emotional labor involved in managing a household, which can be just as demanding as paid work. Also, the idea that income directly translates to responsibility in chores can be problematic because it assumes that financial contribution is the only valid form of contribution.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of fair division of labor. Even if one partner earns more, both are contributing to the household in different ways. The author might be underestimating the value of his wife's contributions, especially if she's handling the child's needs, which can be time-consuming and stressful. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual agreement and communication. If the couple hasn't discussed and agreed upon a fair division of tasks, expecting one side to do more without considering the other's input could be seen as unfair. The author's reasoning that without his income, the family couldn't survive might be a fallacy, as both partners contribute in various ways, and the child's well-being is a shared responsibility.\n\nMoreover, the question of whether the author is the \"asshole\" (AITA) hinges on whether his expectations are unreasonable. While he's not wrong for wanting a fair split, the assumption that income alone dictates responsibility could be flawed. It's possible that the wife is already contributing in ways not mentioned, like part-time work, or that her role is more demanding than he realizes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective might be outdated or unfair because it doesn't consider the value of different contributions and the need for mutual respect and negotiation in a partnership. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong.\n"
