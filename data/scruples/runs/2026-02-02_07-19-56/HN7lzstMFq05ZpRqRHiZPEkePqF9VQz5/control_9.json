I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The user is asking if it's acceptable to expect their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The author makes almost four times what their wife does and wants her to handle more chores, management tasks, and childcare. They argue that since they're funding most of the household, the wife should contribute more in other ways.\n\nHmm, first, I should consider the underlying assumptions here. The author is equating their higher income with a greater contribution and thus justifying the expectation for the wife to take on more domestic responsibilities. But is income the sole measure of contribution? Maybe not. Both partners contribute in different ways\u2014emotional labor, caregiving, etc. Even if the wife earns less, she might have other responsibilities or personal commitments that affect her income.\n\nAlso, the idea that higher income means the other partner should do more chores might be a traditional view of gender roles. The author doesn't specify the gender, but the mention of the wife makes me think it's a male author. Traditional roles often expect women to handle more housework regardless of income, but modern relationships often aim for equality regardless of financial contributions.\n\nAnother point: the author is using a transactional approach, treating housework as something owed in exchange for financial support. But relationships aren't just transactions. Expecting someone to \"earn\" their share of work through income might be unfair. Mutual respect and agreed-upon responsibilities are more sustainable.\n\nWhat about the child's needs? The author mentions that the wife should take on the bulk of childcare. But childcare is a shared responsibility, and both parents should contribute. The author's argument that the wife should handle more because they can't afford to let her focus on income might be missing the point\u2014childcare is a family responsibility, not something the wife is obligated to take on just because the author is the primary earner.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"if not for me\" is a bit presumptuous. It ignores the wife's contributions, both in terms of her income (even though it's less) and her role as a parent. The child's well-being isn't just about money; emotional and physical care from both parents is crucial.\n\nThere's also the aspect of negotiation and communication. The author says it's a constant disagreement, which suggests that they haven't found a middle ground. Expecting the wife to manage everything without considering her workload or preferences might not be fair. Relationships require compromise, and one person's higher income doesn't negate the need for mutual agreement on responsibilities.\n\nIn summary, the author is making assumptions about roles based on income, not considering the value of non-monetary contributions, and possibly enforcing traditional gender roles. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they're not approaching the situation with equality and mutual respect, which are key in healthy relationships.\n"
