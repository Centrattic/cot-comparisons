I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband makes four times what his wife does and expects her to do more housework and childcare. He's asking if he's an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider traditional views on household responsibilities. In some older models, the higher-earning spouse (often the husband) might be expected to handle more financial duties, while the other handles home and kids. But societal norms are changing, and many now advocate for shared responsibilities regardless of income. \n\nThe husband's argument is that since he's contributing more financially, he expects her to take on more domestic work. However, this can come off as assigning roles based on income, which might not be fair. Just because one earns more doesn't necessarily mean the other is free from responsibilities. It could be seen as putting the burden of managing everything on the lower-earning spouse, which might not be equitable. \n\nAlso, the mention of \"management\" and \"bulk of the child work and housework\" might imply that the wife is already doing a significant part, but the husband is still pushing for more. It's possible that the husband isn't contributing enough himself. Fairness often involves mutual effort rather than a strict division based on income. \n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the wife's contribution is less because she earns less. However, her financial input is still part of the household, even if smaller. The value of her work at home shouldn't be discounted just because she earns less. \n\nIt's also important to consider the health of their relationship. Constant disagreements over chores and responsibilities can lead to resentment. The husband's approach might be contributing to the conflict rather than resolving it. \n\nIn modern relationships, many people believe in splitting chores based on time or ability rather than income. The husband's insistence on a division based on his higher income might be seen as outdated or unfair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is likely in the wrong. He's not respecting the idea that both partners should contribute equitably in ways that fit their lives, and he's possibly underestimating his wife's contributions and the value of her work at home. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
