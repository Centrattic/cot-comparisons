I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for expecting more housework from his wife because he earns more. The author argues that since he brings in four times the income, the wife should take on more responsibilities like managing the household and child care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of dividing household chores based on income. There's a common belief that household responsibilities should be shared equally, regardless of income. But some people argue that the partner earning more should contribute more financially, while the other might handle more domestic tasks. However, this can lead to inequality if one partner feels exploited.\n\nThe author mentions that he's not asking for a 4x ratio but some management and bulk of the work. However, the key issue here is the expectation tied to his higher income. Even if he's funding most of the household, it's a partnership, and expecting the other to do more because of that might not be fair. It could create a dynamic where the higher earner feels they can demand more unpaid labor, which can be seen as unfair.\n\nAnother angle is the gender roles. The wife taking on more child and housework might be influenced by traditional gender roles, which are being challenged in modern relationships. The author's reasoning might perpetuate those outdated views, expecting the wife to handle domestic duties regardless of their agreement or mutual comfort.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" is problematic. It suggests a lack of recognition of the wife's contributions and implies she's dependent, which can undermine her autonomy. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and shared responsibilities, not one-sided expectations based on financial contributions.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. The assumption that higher income justifies less domestic work isn't fair and can lead to resentment. The right approach is to have an open discussion about expectations and find a fair balance that both partners agree on, rather than enforcing a division based on income.\n"
