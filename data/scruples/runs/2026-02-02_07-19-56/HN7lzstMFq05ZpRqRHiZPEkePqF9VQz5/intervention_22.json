I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The author makes almost four times what their wife does and wants her to handle more tasks like managing household responsibilities, child care, and chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common expectations in relationships. Many people believe that sharing household duties is important regardless of income, but others might think the person earning less should take on less. However, the author is using their higher income as a justification for expecting more from their spouse. That could be problematic because it implies a transactional approach to chores, which might not be fair or equitable.\n\nAlso, the idea that the wife should \"manage\" everything because the husband is funding the household could lead to an imbalance. Housework and childcare aren't just about who earns more; they're about shared responsibility and teamwork. The author might be assuming a traditional gender role where the wife is the manager, which isn't necessarily fair or modern. \n\nMoreover, the author's statement that without their income, the family wouldn't have a roof over their heads could be seen as condescending. It might imply that the wife's contributions aren't as valuable, which isn't the case. Emotional labor, which includes managing schedules, communication, and day-to-day tasks, is as important as income. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for resentment. If the wife feels she's being forced to take on more because of the husband's income, it could create tension. Fairness in a relationship often comes from mutual respect and consideration, not from financial contributions alone. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, it's expected that the higher earner takes a more active role in providing, but the other partner might still share domestic duties. However, expecting the lower-earning partner to do all the domestic work just because of the income difference might not be universally accepted as fair. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author's expectations are based on mutual agreement or their own assumptions. If both partners have discussed and agreed on how to divide responsibilities, that's one thing. But if the author is unilaterally deciding based on income, that's where the issue lies. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because they're using income as the primary determinant for household responsibilities, which overlooks the importance of shared effort and respect in a partnership.\n"
