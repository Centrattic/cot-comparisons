I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The situation is that the husband makes four times what his wife does and wants her to manage the household and take on more child care and chores. He's wondering if he's an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The key points are the income disparity and the division of labor. The husband is arguing that since he's the primary earner, he's funding the family, so she should contribute more in other areas. But is this a fair expectation?\n\nI should think about the general consensus on this. Many people advocate for an equal division of household responsibilities regardless of income. The idea is that both partners contribute in ways that are fair and balanced, not necessarily tied to how much each earns. However, others might argue that if one partner is earning significantly more, they might have more flexibility to take on more chores. But the question is whether expecting the other to do more because of higher income is wrong.\n\nThe husband mentions that he's funding \"almost the whole operation,\" which could imply financial pressure. However, housework and childcare are non-negotiable for the well-being of the family, and expecting someone to take the bulk of that just because the other earns more might be seen as unfair. It's important to consider mutual respect and shared responsibility in a marriage. If the wife is working, she's also contributing by earning her income, which helps the family, even if it's less than his. The husband's argument might be overlooking the value of her work and the emotional labor involved in managing the household.\n\nAnother angle is the societal shift towards more egalitarian relationships. Traditional gender roles often expect women to handle more domestic tasks, but many modern relationships aim to share these duties equally. The husband's expectation might stem from outdated norms, which could be problematic. It's also worth noting that the wife might be handling responsibilities that aren't visible, like emotional support or managing the child's needs, which are just as important as visible chores.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the answer might depend on the specific circumstances. If the wife is already overburdened or if the division isn't balanced, then the husband's stance could be seen as unjust. The key is whether there's open communication and mutual agreement on roles. The husband's framing of \"expecting\" her to do more without considering her input might be the issue. Relationships should be collaborative, and assuming one's role based on income without discussion could lead to resentment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because expecting unequal contribution based solely on income can be seen as unfair and not considering the partnership's balance.\n"
