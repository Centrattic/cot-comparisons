I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The main points are about income disparity and division of labor at home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and what's typically considered fair. Some people might argue that the person with a higher income should contribute more, not just financially. However, others might say that household responsibilities should be shared equally regardless of income.\n\nThe husband's argument is that since he funds most of the expenses, she should handle more chores and childcare. But this could be seen as placing the burden on the lower-earning spouse, which might not be fair. It's important to note that financial contribution doesn't necessarily dictate the division of domestic labor. \n\nAlso, the mention of management tasks like keeping track of everything might be about organization rather than physical labor. However, expecting one person to manage all aspects could be seen as unfair, especially if it's causing constant conflict. \n\nThere's a common belief that both partners should contribute to household duties, but there's no one-size-fits-all approach. The key here is mutual agreement and respect. If the wife is contributing in other ways, like managing the home, but the husband feels it's not enough, it's a matter of communication and negotiation. \n\nHowever, the husband's reasoning that he's \"funding almost the whole operation\" could imply a transactional view of the relationship, which might be problematic. Housework isn't just about compensating for money; it's about maintaining a shared home and supporting each other. \n\nIn many relationships, when there's a significant income gap, it's common for the lower-earning partner to take on more domestic responsibilities if both agree. But if this is causing resentment or if the division isn't equitable, then the approach might need to be discussed. \n\nThe husband's question is whether he's an asshole for expecting this. The key here is whether his expectations are reasonable and if they've communicated effectively. If they haven't reached a mutual understanding, then placing all the responsibility on the wife could be seen as unfair, especially if it's leading to ongoing conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong because he's assuming a transactional relationship where domestic duties are directly tied to income, which isn't necessarily a fair or balanced approach. Relationships should be based on partnership and mutual respect rather than a trade-off of money for labor.\n"
