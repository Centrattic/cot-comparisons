I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The user made a post on Reddit-style platform, I think, where they're asking if they're the asshole (AITA). The key points here are the income disparity and the division of household responsibilities.\n\nThe author argues that since they make four times what their wife does, she should handle more of the chores and child-related tasks. They mention that without their income, the family wouldn't have a roof or food, so they feel it's fair for the wife to contribute more in other areas. The question is whether this expectation makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of dividing household responsibilities based on income. There's a common belief that chores should be split equally regardless of income because both partners are contributing to the household. On the other hand, some might argue that the higher earner has less financial stress and can afford to take on fewer chores. However, this line of thinking can be problematic because it assumes that financial contribution is the only way to contribute, which might not consider the emotional labor or other non-financial contributions.\n\nThe author is suggesting that their wife should manage everything and handle most of the childcare and housework. This could be seen as shifting the burden of household management onto the spouse who earns less, which might not be fair. Emotional labor, like keeping track of schedules, managing the household, and coordinating childcare, is often undervalued and can be just as demanding as physical labor. Even if one partner earns more, splitting both the financial and household responsibilities might be more equitable.\n\nAnother angle is the societal expectation that the higher earner is also the primary breadwinner, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should take on fewer responsibilities. In many cases, couples agree on a division that works for their specific situation, which could vary based on individual work demands, personal preferences, or other factors. However, expecting someone to do more just because the other earns more can lead to resentment and imbalance.\n\nIt's also important to note that the author's statement \"If not for me, she couldn't keep...\" implies a sense of superiority or entitlement, which can be harmful. Relationships are built on mutual respect and cooperation, not on a hierarchy based on income. Expecting more from the other partner just because they earn less might not account for their contributions in other areas, such as childcare, which is also a significant responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might believe they're being fair by tying chores to income, this approach can be seen as unfair because it overlooks the value of emotional labor and the importance of shared responsibilities in maintaining a healthy relationship. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
