I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who makes four times as much as his wife and expects her to do more housework and childcare. He's questioning if it's fair to expect her to manage these tasks because he's the primary breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of shared responsibilities in a marriage. Traditionally, there's been a gendered expectation where the higher-earning spouse (often the husband) expects the other to handle more domestic duties. However, modern relationships often emphasize equality, regardless of income disparity. \n\nThe key points here: the author is making a financial argument\u2014since he's funding most of the household, he believes she should contribute more at home. But expecting someone to take on more labor just because the other is earning more is a common debate. It's important to note that financial contribution doesn't automatically translate to a fair division of labor. Both partners' time and effort are valuable, and assumptions about roles can lead to resentment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions \"management\" tasks. Delegating tasks based on income might not align with each person's strengths or preferences. If the wife is overwhelmed with other responsibilities, expecting her to manage everything could be unrealistic. Communication is crucial here. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that their expectations aren't aligned, and they might need to have a more open conversation about what each person can realistically handle.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. The author assumes that his funding ensures the child's needs are met, but the child's well-being also depends on both parents' emotional and physical presence. The wife's role in childcare is equally important, and expecting her to take the bulk of that without considering her workload might be unfair, especially if she's managing a job as well.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while some people might agree that the higher earner expects more domestic help, others might argue that responsibilities should be divided fairly regardless of income. The question is whether the author's expectations are reasonable. If he's expecting her to do 4x the chores, that's a direct correlation to income, but he also mentions not expecting exactly 4x, just more. Still, the underlying assumption is that income dictates contribution, which can be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective might stem from traditional views, but in a modern context, equal partnership isn't necessarily tied to financial contribution. The fact that this is a constant source of conflict indicates that the current arrangement isn't working for both parties. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's imposing expectations based on income rather than mutual agreement and fair division of labor.\n"
