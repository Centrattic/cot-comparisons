I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times more. He argues that since he's the main financial provider, she should handle most of the chores and childcare.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider common perspectives on this. In many relationships, there's an expectation of shared responsibilities regardless of income. Money isn't the only contribution. But some people might think that the person earning more has a right to expect more help in other areas. But is that fair?\n\nThe author is suggesting that his wife should manage things and do the bulk of the work. That could be seen as unequal, even if he's contributing financially. Equality in chores isn't necessarily tied to income. Maybe the wife has other responsibilities or limitations? The author might be overlooking her contributions or not taking into account her capacity.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"am I an asshole\" implies he feels guilty, but he's not getting the support he wants. It's a conflict where both might feel they're being fair. But from a general standpoint, expecting someone to do more just because the other earns more might not be fair. Relationships often require mutual effort regardless of financial status. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not considering equal partnership and is using financial contribution as a reason to shift more non-monetary responsibilities onto his wife.\n"
