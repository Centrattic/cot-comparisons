I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The author makes almost four times more than his wife and argues that since he's funding most of the household, she should handle more chores and management.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider traditional views versus modern perspectives. In some traditional setups, the higher earner might expect the other partner to handle more domestic duties. But nowadays, there's a push for equality in chores regardless of income. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't saying she should do four times the chores, just that she should manage things and take the bulk of child and housework. He feels justified because he's the main financial provider. However, this could stem from outdated gender roles where women are expected to do more housework even if they earn less. \n\nAlso, the key point here is mutual agreement and communication. If both partners agreed on a division of labor, that's one thing. But if the wife feels overburdened or if this expectation is leading to constant disagreement, it's a problem. The author's perspective might be missing the emotional labor and the fact that managing the household is work too, which might not be recognized as such. \n\nAnother angle: income shouldn't necessarily dictate the division of chores. Even if one partner earns more, both contribute to the household. The author's argument could be seen as using financial contribution as a reason to shift more domestic responsibility onto his wife, which might not be fair. \n\nBut maybe there's a balance. If the husband is working longer hours because of his higher income, maybe he's less available. However, that's a different point. The question is whether expecting the wife to handle more because he earns more is wrong. \n\nIn terms of fairness, chores should be divided equitably based on what each can do, not just income. So expecting her to manage more just because he earns more could be seen as unfair. It might be reinforcing gender stereotypes where women are expected to handle household management regardless of their income. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's using his financial contribution as a justification for an unequal division of labor, which could perpetuate traditional gender roles and overlook the value of domestic work.\n"
