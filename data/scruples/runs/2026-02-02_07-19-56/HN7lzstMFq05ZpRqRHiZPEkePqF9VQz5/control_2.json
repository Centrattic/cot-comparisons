I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author argues that since they make four times what their wife does, she should handle more of the housework and childcare. They feel it's fair because they're the primary breadwinner. But wait, is income directly linked to responsibility for chores? That's a common debate. Some people believe that splitting chores equally is fair regardless of income, while others think the higher earner should have more financial responsibility, allowing the other to handle more domestic tasks.\n\nHowever, there's a lot to consider here. The author mentions that without their income, the family couldn't afford basic needs. But their wife does contribute financially, even if it's less. Does that mean she's not contributing enough? Also, childcare and housework are significant responsibilities. Studies show that even when one partner earns more, both should share domestic duties to maintain balance and prevent burnout.\n\nThe author is asking if they're an asshole for expecting this. The key point is the assumption that income should determine division of labor. That can lead to resentment, especially if the wife feels underappreciated or overburdened. It's possible the author isn't considering their wife's contributions beyond just money\u2014like emotional labor or the stress of managing a household.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the wife isn't doing her fair share because of other commitments, like work, or maybe she's also handling a lot but not being acknowledged. The author might not realize that housework isn't just about time but also about the mental load of managing everything, which can be exhausting.\n\nAlso, the child care aspect is important. Both parents should ideally share that responsibility. If one is doing most of it, that's a valid point of contention. The author's framing of \"funding almost the whole operation\" might overlook the value of their wife's financial contribution and her role in other areas.\n\nIn many relationships, fairness isn't just about splitting tasks proportionally to income but about mutual respect and understanding each other's capacities. If the author's wife is already overwhelmed with her job and the household, expecting her to manage everything else might be unreasonable. It's possible the author is not recognizing her efforts or the emotional labor involved.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's expectation might be based on outdated or unfair assumptions. They could be in the wrong by not acknowledging their wife's contributions and by assuming that their higher income automatically means she should take on more. The correct answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
