I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times as much. The user already thinks the author is wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack the situation. The key points here are income disparity and division of household responsibilities. The author argues that since he earns more, his wife should handle more chores, especially management and childcare. But is that a valid expectation?\n\nWell, income contributions don't necessarily dictate household responsibilities. In many relationships, both partners share domestic duties regardless of earnings. The assumption that higher income justifies less involvement in chores might stem from traditional gender roles, which are increasingly being challenged. The author's reasoning could be seen as unfair because it imposes unequal expectations based on income, which isn't a standard measure for domestic labor. Also, the statement \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" sounds dismissive of her contributions and might undermine her role in the partnership. It's important to consider mutual respect and communication rather than a transactional view of responsibilities. So, the author's perspective seems to be in the wrong because he's setting expectations based on income, which isn't equitable. The answer should be A.\n"
