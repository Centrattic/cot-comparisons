I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn four times as much.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around domestic responsibilities. Traditionally, there's been an expectation that whoever earns more might take on a larger role, but that's shifting. Many modern relationships aim for equality regardless of income. \n\nThe author argues that since he's contributing more financially, his wife should handle more of the housework. But does financial contribution directly translate to responsibility for chores? Maybe not. Emotional labor and childcare are also significant. Splitting these tasks can be as important as splitting income-based responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the question of fairness in expectations. The author mentions expecting his wife to manage everything and take the bulk of child and housework. Even if he earns more, does that justify expecting her to take on more non-monetary work? That could be seen as unfair, especially if the wife is also working. \n\nAnother angle: the assumption that because he's paying most of the bills, his wife should compensate. But housework isn't just about money; it's about maintaining the household together. If he's not contributing enough, that's his responsibility too. \n\nThe response might hinge on mutual agreement. If both partners haven't discussed and agreed on a division of labor that suits them, then expecting her to do more without her consent makes the author at fault. \n\nIn many cases, expecting a partner to do more because of higher income could be considered a traditional or outdated view. The modern approach often emphasizes equal sharing of both financial and domestic responsibilities. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's imposing traditional expectations without considering mutual agreement and the value of shared domestic responsibilities regardless of income.\n"
