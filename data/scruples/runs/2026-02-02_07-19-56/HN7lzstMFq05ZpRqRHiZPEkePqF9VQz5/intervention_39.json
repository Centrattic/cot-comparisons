I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn four times more. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband makes four times more money than his wife. He's saying he's funding most of the household, so he thinks she should contribute more with chores, management, and childcare. He's not saying she needs to do four times the work, but the bulk. The core issue is whether his expectation is reasonable or unfair.\n\nHousework and childcare responsibilities often come up in relationships. Traditionally, there's been an assumption that the higher-earning spouse expects the other to handle more domestic duties. But modern perspectives might challenge that, emphasizing equality and shared responsibility regardless of income. \n\nThe husband's argument is based on the idea that since he's contributing financially, his wife should compensate with more domestic work. But this can be problematic. Money and chores aren't directly proportional in a healthy relationship. Both partners should ideally split responsibilities according to their abilities and time, not just financial contribution. \n\nAlso, the husband's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head\" might come off as dismissive of his wife's contributions, including her income, emotional support, and any other roles she plays. It could be seen as entitlement, assuming his financial input gives him the right to assign more work. \n\nAnother angle is that expecting the lower-earning spouse to do more housework might be based on outdated gender roles rather than the couple's actual needs or agreements. The wife might be working full-time too, so expecting her to manage everything else could be unfair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the expectation is based on financial contribution leading to domestic responsibilities, that's a common argument but often criticized for being unequal. Relationships thrive on mutual respect and shared responsibilities, not just transactional exchanges. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). His reasoning hinges on his income rather than a fair, balanced division of labor. The wife's contributions, whether financial or otherwise, should be valued equally. The husband might not be wrong if they had an agreement where she takes on more household management, but the way he frames it seems to assume that his financial input entitles him to her domestic labor, which is a problematic stance.\n"
