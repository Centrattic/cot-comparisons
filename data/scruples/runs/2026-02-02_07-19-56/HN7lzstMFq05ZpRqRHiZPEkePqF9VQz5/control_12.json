I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework since he earns four times as much. The key points here are the income disparity and the division of labor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal expectations. Traditionally, higher earners might expect their partners to take on more domestic responsibilities, but modern views often challenge that notion. Many people advocate for an equal share of chores regardless of income. The author mentions not expecting her to do 4x the chores, but rather managing and handling more of the child and housework. \n\nThe wife's perspective is important too. Even if the husband is contributing financially, emotional labor and physical chores are significant. The author might be overlooking the value of non-monetary contributions. Also, the argument that without his income, they can't afford things, but the wife's role in childcare and housework is equally vital for the family's well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the author to take responsibility instead of shifting the burden. Shared responsibility could foster teamwork. The question is whether expecting her to manage everything is fair. Maybe the author isn't considering that both partners have limitations and need balance. \n\nCultural and individual differences play a role. Some might find the author's stance reasonable, while others see it as unfair. The answer hinges on whether the expectation is based on equity or inequity. If the author is using income as a justification to avoid sharing responsibilities, that's a problem. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong, because he's not recognizing the equal importance of domestic work and may be imposing traditional role expectations.\n"
