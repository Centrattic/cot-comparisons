I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who brings in four times the income of his wife and expects her to do more housework and child care. He's asking if he's an asshole for this expectation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and fairness. Traditionally, in some cultures, the higher-earning spouse might expect the other to handle more domestic duties. But in modern times, there's a shift towards more equal sharing of household responsibilities regardless of income. \n\nThe author is justifying his position by saying he funds most of the household, so the wife should contribute more in other areas. The key issue here is whether income should directly correlate with the division of labor at home. Many people argue that household chores and childcare are shared responsibilities and shouldn't be determined by who earns more. \n\nAlso, the author mentions \"management\" and \"bulk of the child work and housework.\" It's important to note that delegating tasks based on income can lead to inequality in the relationship. Even if one partner earns more, both are equally responsible for the family's well-being. The idea that one person's financial contribution entitles them to less domestic work is problematic because it can create resentment and imbalance.\n\nMoreover, the author's statement implies that the wife's contribution is less valuable just because she earns less. This overlooks the importance of emotional labor and the fact that staying home or working a lower-paying job might involve other sacrifices. The assumption that the higher earner's contribution is more important is a common point of contention in relationships.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of fairness. If both partners are working, even if one earns more, they might both be equally tired or busy. Assigning more chores based on income doesn't account for the actual effort each person is putting in. It's more about mutual respect and negotiation rather than economic factors.\n\nIn many modern relationships, the expectation is for both partners to share responsibilities equitably, regardless of income. The author's approach could be seen as traditional or even sexist, as it's placing a greater burden on the wife without considering equality. It's also worth considering that the wife might have her own reasons for working less (like caring for the child), and the author might not be considering her contributions fully.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's using his higher income as a justification to shift more domestic responsibilities onto his wife, which perpetuates unequal gender roles and doesn't account for shared responsibility in a partnership. The answer should be A.\n"
