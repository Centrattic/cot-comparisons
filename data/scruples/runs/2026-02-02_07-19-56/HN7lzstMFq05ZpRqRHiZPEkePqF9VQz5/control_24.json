I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. The question is pretty straightforward, but I need to consider different perspectives.\n\nFirst, the author makes almost four times what his wife does. He argues that since he's the primary earner, she should handle more of the domestic responsibilities. But wait, does income directly translate to how much someone should contribute at home? Not necessarily. Relationships aren't always about splitting chores based on income. They\u2019re usually about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. \n\nHe mentions expecting her to manage everything and take on most of the childcare and housework. But dividing chores isn't always a numbers game. Even if he's earning more, that doesn't automatically mean she should do more. People have different capacities and strengths. Maybe she's working a job that's less demanding, allowing her to focus on home duties, but that's an assumption. It's also important to consider that childcare and housework are full-time jobs in themselves. \n\nThe author's reasoning seems to imply that his higher income justifies his wife doing more. But this could be seen as transactional. Marriage isn't typically based on a strict exchange of money for chores. Both partners should contribute in ways that are fair to them, considering their individual circumstances. \n\nAlso, the question of whether he's an asshole hinges on fairness. If he's not contributing at all to household tasks, that could be problematic. Even if he's working more hours, taking on some chores is important for partnership. The expectation here might be unreasonable because it's not considering his wife's contributions and the emotional labor she's already doing. \n\nAnother angle is cultural norms. In some cultures, traditional gender roles might support this view, but modern relationships often encourage equality. The key issue here is whether the author is respecting his wife's role and contributions. If he's dismissing her efforts or not acknowledging her work, that's where the problem lies. \n\nThe fact that this is a constant disagreement shows that communication is lacking. Instead of assuming based on income, they should discuss their needs and find a balance that works for both. The author's approach might be coming from a place of feeling that his financial contribution entitles him to less domestic work, but that's a common source of conflict in relationships. \n\nIn summary, the author is likely in the wrong because he's making an assumption based on income without considering the dynamics of their relationship. Housework and childcare should be shared equitably, not divided by salary. The expectation that his wife must do more simply because he earns more is unfair and overlooks the value of emotional labor and mutual support in a partnership.\n"
