I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the husband makes four times more money than his wife and he's arguing that she should do more housework and manage the household because he's funding most of the operation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The husband believes that since he earns more, his wife should take on more responsibilities at home. But is this a valid expectation? I remember that in many relationships, the division of labor isn't always strictly tied to income. People often consider factors like time availability, skills, personal preferences, and mutual agreements.\n\nThe husband mentions that he's funding almost the whole operation, so he expects her to handle the management and child care. But wait, is it fair to assume that financial contribution directly translates to domestic responsibilities? Maybe not. Some might argue that both partners have their own contributions\u2014financial and non-financial. If the wife is working, even if part-time, she's contributing financially and might have less time for housework. Plus, childcare is a shared parental responsibility, not just a matter of who pays the bills.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect and communication. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that they haven't found a compromise that works for both. The husband's approach might be seen as imposing his expectations without considering his wife's input or circumstances. Expecting her to take the \"management\" role could be a traditional gender role, which might not be fair in a modern, equitable relationship.\n\nAnother point is the assumption that because he makes more money, she should do more. That could be a form of transactional thinking, which might not foster a healthy partnership. Relationships are built on mutual support and teamwork, not on a business-like exchange of services. If the wife feels pressured because he's the main earner, that could lead to resentment. Also, if he didn't earn more, would he still expect the same? It seems like he's using his income as a justification, which might not be the healthiest reasoning.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some cultures, the higher-earning partner manages the finances, but in many modern relationships, that's changing. It's more about what both partners agree upon rather than societal expectations.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's contributions and the equitable sharing of responsibilities. Assuming that higher income automatically means the other partner should do more housework isn't fair. A healthy relationship requires both partners to communicate and find a balance that works for them, rather than assigning tasks based on income.\n"
