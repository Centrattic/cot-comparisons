I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn four times more. The author argues that since they fund most of the household, their wife should manage more chores and childcare.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the societal norms and expectations around domestic responsibilities. There's been a lot of discussion about gender roles and equality in relationships. Traditionally, women were expected to handle more housework, but modern views often push for a more equal distribution. However, income doesn't always directly correlate with who should handle chores. Even if one partner earns more, they might have other responsibilities like working longer hours.\n\nAlso, the author mentions their wife's income is lower, but that doesn't mean she's less capable or should take on more. Relationships ideally involve mutual respect and shared responsibilities, regardless of income. The key here is whether the expectations are fair and communicated effectively. The author is making an assumption that higher income justifies more domestic work from the other partner, which might not be equitable.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved in \"management\" tasks. Tracking everything can be as demanding as physical chores. If the wife is already doing other tasks, expecting her to manage more without considering her workload could be unfair. It's important to consider both partners' time and energy.\n\nThe question also touches on the fairness of dividing chores based on income. Some might argue that financial contribution is separate from domestic duties. Partners should negotiate what works best for them, considering each other's schedules and strengths, rather than using income as a metric.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning might stem from outdated notions of gender roles and financial responsibility. Expecting their wife to manage more because of higher income could be seen as placing an unfair burden on her. The answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong if they're not considering mutual agreement and shared responsibilities.\n"
