I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author makes four times what his wife does and is asking if it's fair for him to expect her to handle more chores, like managing the household and child care. He argues that since he's contributing more financially, she should take on more domestic responsibilities.\n\nHmm. There's a common belief that financial contribution should dictate domestic duties, but I know that in many relationships, people aim for an equal division of labor regardless of income. Some might argue that both partners should share chores equally, no matter how much each earns. Others might think that the higher earner should take on more financial responsibilities, allowing the other to handle more household tasks. But is it fair to assume that because he earns more, she should do more?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of mutual agreement. If the couple hasn't discussed and agreed on how to divide responsibilities, expecting the wife to take on more based on income could be seen as unfair. It might be taking advantage of her labor without considering her workload or contributions. \n\nAnother point is the cultural context. In some cultures, traditional gender roles might lead to the woman handling more household duties. However, in more modern or egalitarian relationships, both partners share equally. The question is about right or wrong, which can be subjective, but the key issue is whether the expectations are fair and communicated.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if he's not considering his wife's input or if he's taking for granted her contributions without mutual agreement. Even if he's contributing financially, the emotional labor and physical chores are also significant and should be shared equitably. Assigning more tasks based solely on income could lead to resentment and imbalance in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because expecting his wife to do more housework just because he earns more isn't fair without mutual agreement and consideration of her workload. It's important for both partners to have a balanced and consensual division of responsibilities, not based on income alone.\n"
