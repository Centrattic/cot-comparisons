I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. The situation is that he makes almost four times what she does and wants her to handle more domestic tasks, like management, childcare, and housework.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments here. The author is using the income disparity as a justification. He's saying since he's the main earner, she should take on more of the non-monetary responsibilities. But is that a valid reasoning?\n\nWell, in modern relationships, there's a lot of emphasis on equality, not just in financial contributions but also in domestic duties. The idea that the higher earner can \"buy\" their way out of responsibilities is a traditional view that's being challenged. Even if one partner earns more, the expectation that they should do less housework because of that might not be fair.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that without him, they can't afford the basic needs. But that's a bit of a false dichotomy. Housework isn't just about the money; it's about the shared responsibility of maintaining a household. Even if one person pays the bills, the other's contributions in managing the home are equally important for the family's well-being.\n\nAnother angle: if the wife is working, even part-time, she's contributing economically. The author might be underestimating her work or not considering her capacity to handle more tasks. Plus, the amount of housework isn't directly proportional to income. It's more about mutual agreement and respect for each other's contributions.\n\nThere's also the aspect of negotiation and communication. The author and wife have had this disagreement for four years. Instead of just expecting her to take on more, maybe they need to find a balanced approach that works for both. Assuming that higher income equals less household responsibility could lead to resentment and imbalance in the relationship.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's assuming that his higher income automatically entitles him to less domestic work. The fair approach would be for both partners to share household responsibilities regardless of income, based on their abilities and the needs of the family.\n"
