I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is making 4 times what his wife does and is asking if it's fair to expect her to do more housework and childcare. He argues that since he's the main financial provider, she should handle more of the domestic tasks. The question is whether he's an a**hole for expecting that.\n\nHmm. Well, in many relationships, the division of household labor is a sensitive topic. Even though traditionally men might earn more, that doesn't automatically mean they should do less work at home. Studies have shown that even when women work, they often end up doing more housework. But here, the husband is the higher earner and is suggesting the wife should take on more, which could be seen as unfair if the work is already split unevenly. \n\nBut wait, the husband is not saying she has to do 4x the chores, just that she should manage things and take on the bulk. He's also pointing out that without his income, the family couldn't survive. However, financial contribution doesn't necessarily translate to a right to less domestic work. Many people believe in an equal split regardless of income. \n\nAlso, the presence of a child adds to the workload. Childcare and housework are often gendered tasks, and the husband might be using his higher income as a justification to avoid these responsibilities. That could be problematic because it perpetuates traditional gender roles, which some find outdated. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife is already contributing in other ways, like managing the household or taking care of the child. If the husband is expecting her to take on more without acknowledging her existing contributions, that's an issue. The key is whether there's a fair and open discussion about their expectations and whether both are contributing in ways that feel equitable to them, not just based on income.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, which I can see because the argument hinges on income rather than mutual agreement. So, the answer might be A, but I need to make sure. The question is whether the husband is wrong to expect more from his wife because of his higher income. If the expectation is based solely on income without considering other factors, then yes, he's in the wrong. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and shared responsibilities, not financial contributions alone.\n"
