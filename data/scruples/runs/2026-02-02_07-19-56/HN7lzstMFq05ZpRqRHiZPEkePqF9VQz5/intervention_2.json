I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. Hmm, the main issue here is about fairness in household responsibilities. The author makes four times what his wife does and argues that since he's funding most of the household, she should handle more chores and child-rearing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and expectations. There's a common belief that higher income should equate to less domestic work, but that's not necessarily a given. Some might argue that both partners should share responsibilities equally regardless of income, while others might think that the higher earner could take on more financial burden and the other could manage the home.\n\nBut wait, the author is specifically asking if it's fair to expect his wife to manage the household and do most of the child and housework. The key here is whether this expectation is reasonable. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate why.\n\nOne angle is the concept of equity versus equality. Even if the author earns more, does that automatically mean the wife should take on more tasks? Maybe not. Equity considers individual circumstances, but equality might suggest splitting tasks 50-50. However, if the wife's job is less demanding or allows for more flexibility, perhaps she can contribute more at home. But if her job is just as demanding, then expecting her to do more because the author earns more might be unfair.\n\nAnother point is the assumption that the author's income is the sole reason for the household's stability. While he contributes more financially, it's important to recognize that his wife's income also contributes, even if it's less. Also, the emotional labor and childcare are significant responsibilities that shouldn't be underestimated.\n\nCultural factors also play a role. In some cultures, it's expected that the higher earner focuses on their career, while the other manages the home. But in modern, more progressive views, shared responsibilities are encouraged regardless of income. The author's argument that he's \"funding almost the whole operation\" might overlook the non-monetary contributions of his wife, such as emotional support, childcare, which have value.\n\nMoreover, the question of whether the wife is willing and able to take on more tasks is important. If she's already overwhelmed with her job and the current responsibilities, adding more might be unreasonable. The author's expectation might not consider her capacity or willingness.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's implying that his financial contribution entitles him to less domestic work, which can perpetuate traditional gender roles. It's essential to have mutual understanding and negotiation rather than assuming responsibilities based on income. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
