I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The author makes four times what their wife does and feels that since they fund most of the household, the wife should handle more chores and child care.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author assumes that because they earn more, their wife should take on more domestic responsibilities. But is that a fair assumption? Traditionally, some might think that the higher earner should contribute less to chores, but modern relationships often emphasize shared responsibilities regardless of income. \n\nThe key issue is whether the author is justified in expecting unequal distribution of chores based on income. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's argument is that they're funding the household, so others should contribute in other ways. However, this could be seen as outdated, as financial contribution doesn't necessarily dictate domestic labor. \n\nAlso, childcare and housework aren't just tasks but also emotional labor. Even if the wife isn't the primary earner, managing these tasks can be as demanding. The author might be underestimating the effort involved in managing the household and child care. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is not acknowledging that their wife is contributing in her own way. Maybe they are both working, so it's about balancing work and home. The author's approach might be leading to resentment if the wife feels overburdened with chores despite her job. \n\nMoreover, the question of fairness in chores isn't just about income. It's about mutual respect and shared responsibility. If the author is making this a point of contention, it might stem from a lack of communication or understanding of each other's roles. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's expectation seems to be based on an outdated model where income dictates chores. Modern, equitable relationships often split chores based on what each person can manage, not necessarily their income. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong by assuming their higher income justifies expecting more from their spouse in domestic duties. It's about mutual effort rather than financial contribution.\n"
