I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more money.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the arguments presented. The author says they make four times what their wife does and feel it's fair for her to take on more household responsibilities. They mention that if it wasn't for their income, the family couldn't afford the basics, so they believe the wife should handle more of the domestic tasks.\n\nI should consider the common perspectives on this. Some people might argue that splitting chores should be based on time available rather than income, as everyone's time is equal. Others might think that the higher earner has more flexibility to contribute financially, so the lower earner might have more time to manage the household. However, this can vary based on individual circumstances and agreements between partners.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author's expectation is reasonable. The phrase \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) suggests they're unsure. The user wants a binary answer: A if the author is wrong, B if not.\n\nIn relationships, fairness is subjective. While the author is contributing more financially, the assumption that this justifies less domestic work isn't universally accepted. Many people believe in an equal split of chores regardless of income, especially with a child involved. The author might be overlooking their wife's contributions and the importance of mutual support in parenting. Also, the financial contribution doesn't necessarily reduce the need for shared responsibility in childcare and household tasks.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because expecting the spouse to do more chores based solely on higher income might not consider the balance of responsibilities and the shared nature of parenting duties. The author might not be acknowledging the emotional and physical labor involved in managing a household and raising a child, which are significant and should be shared equitably.\n"
