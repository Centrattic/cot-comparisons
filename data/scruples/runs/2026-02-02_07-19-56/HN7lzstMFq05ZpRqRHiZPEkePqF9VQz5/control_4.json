I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework since they earn four times as much. The author is married with a child and this is a recurring disagreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. The author makes significantly more money and is using that as a justification for expecting their wife to handle more domestic responsibilities. The key point here is whether the wife's contribution to housework is adequate based on the income disparity.\n\nIn many relationships, household responsibilities are shared based on mutual agreement and what works for both parties. However, the author is suggesting that their higher income entitles them to less work. This could be problematic because income isn't the only factor in shared responsibilities. Time, energy, and personal circumstances also play a role. For example, if the wife is working and managing the household, she might already be juggling a lot. \n\nAnother angle is the assumption that because the author is the primary breadwinner, the wife should compensate with more chores. But this can lead to an unfair dynamic where the primary earner expects less contribution, which might not account for the wife's own work, whether paid or unpaid. It's important to note that housework is a shared responsibility in many healthy relationships, regardless of income.\n\nThe question also mentions that the wife isn't doing 4x more chores but more in terms of management and child-related tasks. The author is asking if it's reasonable to expect her to take on the \"management\" role. However, expecting someone to manage most of the household and childcare without considering their own workload could be seen as unfair, especially if it leads to burnout or resentment.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that both parties might not have reached a clear understanding of each other's expectations. The author's argument could be viewed as placing an unfair burden on the wife, which might not take into account her contributions or the balance of responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's a shift towards more egalitarian relationships where both partners share responsibilities equally, irrespective of income. The author's stance might reflect outdated notions where the higher earner expects the other to handle more domestic tasks, which can perpetuate gender stereotypes if the wife is the one doing the majority of the housework.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's expectation might be seen as unfair because it's based solely on income disparity without considering the wife's own contributions and the equitable sharing of household duties. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because expecting someone to do more housework just because you earn more can create an imbalanced and potentially resentful relationship dynamic.\n"
