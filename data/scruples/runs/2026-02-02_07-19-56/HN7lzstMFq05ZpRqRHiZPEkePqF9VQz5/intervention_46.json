I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expecting his wife to do more housework and childcare because he earns 4 times more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms here. In many modern relationships, there's an emphasis on shared responsibilities regardless of income. The idea is that household chores and childcare are joint responsibilities. But the author is arguing that since he contributes more financially, his wife should take on more of the domestic work. \n\nBut wait, expecting someone to do more because they earn less might not be fair. Money is just one aspect of contributing to a household. Emotional labor, childcare, and home management are significant and shouldn't be undervalued. Even if one partner earns more, both are contributing in different ways. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he funds most of the household, the wife should handle more tasks. However, this could imply that the wife's financial contribution is less valuable, which might lead to an imbalanced dynamic. Also, the author mentions that the wife isn't doing the \"management\" and bulk of the child work, which might mean she's not taking on the organizational tasks as he expects. \n\nBut the problem is that expecting the lower-earning partner to do more housework can perpetuate traditional gender roles, especially if the wife is doing the majority of the work in both financial and domestic aspects. There's a tendency to equate financial contribution with overall contribution, but that's not necessarily accurate. The emotional and physical labor of managing a household and caring for a child is substantial and shouldn't be offset by income alone.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that there's a lack of mutual understanding or agreement on roles. Instead of expecting her to take on more based on his income, they might need to discuss and divide responsibilities in a way that's fair to both, considering their individual capacities and the nature of their work outside the home.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof...\" might come off as dismissive of her contributions and could be seen as undermining her role. It's important to recognize that both partners contribute in different ways, and their contributions should be valued equally, regardless of income disparity.\n\nIn many progressive views, the belief is that household responsibilities should be shared equitably, not based on income. So even if one earns more, the expectation that the other does more housework might be seen as unfair. The key is how the couple perceives fairness and what they agree upon. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, so I need to assess if his reasoning is ethically sound.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's argument that his wife should do more because he earns more might be based on an outdated or transactional view of relationships. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
