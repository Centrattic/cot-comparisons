I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting more housework from his wife since he earns more. So, he makes four times what she does and wants her to handle more chores and management. He's basically saying that because he's the main provider, she should contribute more at home.\n\nHmm, I need to figure out if this is fair. Well, income doesn't necessarily dictate how household responsibilities should be divided. Even if one partner earns more, sharing chores is about mutual respect and teamwork. The author is assuming that his higher income entitles him to less work, which might not be the right approach.\n\nAlso, the wife might have other responsibilities, like caring for the child. If she's working, she's also coming home to manage the household. Maybe the author isn't considering her workload. Plus, expecting her to manage everything because he's the main earner could be putting too much pressure on her. It's possible that they need to communicate better and find a balance that works for both of them, rather than basing it on income.\n\nAnother angle is that traditional gender roles might be influencing his expectations. He might think that since he's the provider, she should handle domestic tasks. But that's a stereotype and doesn't account for their individual strengths or preferences. Maybe they should split the chores based on what each can do, not just financial contributions.\n\nI think the key here is that fairness in a relationship isn't about splitting chores proportionally to income, but about cooperation and understanding each other's needs. The author is making an assumption that's not fair because it's not about who earns more, but about shared responsibility. So, he's in the wrong by expecting her to do more based solely on his higher earnings.\n"
