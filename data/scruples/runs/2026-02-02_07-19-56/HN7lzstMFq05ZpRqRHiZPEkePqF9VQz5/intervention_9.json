I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework since he earns more. The key points here are the income disparity and the division of labor.\n\nFirst, the author makes almost four times what his wife does. He argues that because of his higher income, she should handle more domestic responsibilities. He mentions expecting her to manage things and take on most of the childcare and housework. He feels justified because he's covering most of the financial responsibilities.\n\nNow, considering traditional gender roles, men are often expected to be the primary earners while women handle household duties. However, modern relationships often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of income. The question is whether financial contribution should dictate domestic duties.\n\nThe author's reasoning might stem from the idea that since he's the primary breadwinner, the wife should handle more at home. But this can be problematic because it reinforces outdated stereotypes and doesn't account for mutual support. Marriage or any partnership should ideally balance not just financial contributions but also emotional and domestic labor.\n\nThe wife might feel she's being asked to do more because of his income, not because of mutual agreement. Expecting her to take on the bulk of the work because he pays for things could be seen as unfair, especially if she's also working. It's possible she's contributing in other ways that aren't being acknowledged, like managing certain aspects or taking care of the child's needs outside the home.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"emotional labor\"\u2014the mental load of planning, organizing, and keeping track of household tasks. Even if she's doing more physical chores, the mental load might be taxing. The author might not be recognizing that she's already managing a lot, which could lead to imbalance.\n\nAlso, the fact that they have a child complicates things. Childcare is a shared responsibility, but if the father is working longer hours due to his higher income, that might impact his availability. However, expecting the wife to handle most of the childcare because he's earning more isn't necessarily fair. Both parents should ideally share this, considering their available time and energy.\n\nThe core issue here is the assumption that income level directly correlates to domestic responsibility. This can create resentment and may overlook the wife's contributions. The author might be in the wrong for not considering a more equitable division of labor based on their individual circumstances and capacities, rather than just financial contributions.\n\nIn modern relationships, it's often encouraged to divide tasks based on what each person can do, not just who earns more. So expecting the wife to do more because he earns more might not be fair, hence the author could be in the wrong.\n"
