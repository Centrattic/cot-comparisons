I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times more. Hmm. So the author argues that since he's the primary breadwinner, his wife should handle more domestic tasks and child-rearing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Traditionally, men were the main earners, and women handled more domestic work. But these days, expectations have shifted towards more equality, even when one partner earns more. There's a growing idea that financial contribution doesn't necessarily dictate the division of labor at home. \n\nThe author mentions not expecting her to do four times the chores, but more like the \"management\" and bulk of the child and housework. But does the higher income mean the other should take on more? Some might argue that if one person is working longer hours for higher pay, they might be more tired and need help with chores. Conversely, the other might have more flexibility to contribute to household tasks. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of mutual agreement. The question is about expectations. If both partners didn't agree on this division initially, it could lead to resentment. The wife might feel pressured to work more and manage the household, leading to burnout. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's \"funding almost the whole operation,\" implying that his financial contribution justifies more domestic help. However, many people believe that fairness in a relationship isn't just about splitting tasks based on income but about contributing in ways that work for both people's circumstances and strengths. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is framing this as a question of whether he's an asshole. The phrase \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often reflects the person's own uncertainty. The key here is whether expecting a spouse to do more housework just because you earn more is a reasonable expectation. \n\nIn many modern relationships, both partners aim for a balanced split. The idea that one person's higher income automatically means the other should take on more domestic responsibilities isn't universally accepted. Some argue that this perpetuates traditional gender roles, which can be unfair, especially if the wife is willing and able to contribute but not in that specific way. \n\nHowever, the answer might depend on the couple's agreement. If both agreed to this arrangement from the start, maybe it's not the author's fault. But the fact that it's causing a constant disagreement suggests that there's a mismatch in expectations. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's expectation might be seen as unfair if it's based solely on income and not on mutual discussion and agreement. The question is whether it's reasonable to expect more household duties from the partner with lower income. Many would say no, hence the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
