I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (author) is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn four times as much. The key points here are the income disparity and the division of labor at home.\n\nFirst, the author's argument is based on the idea that since they contribute more financially, their spouse should take on more domestic responsibilities. But is that a valid expectation? I remember reading about the concept of \"comparable worth\" in relationships, where financial contributions don't necessarily equate to equal responsibility in other areas. Just because someone earns more doesn't mean they should do less around the house. \n\nThen there's the aspect of child care. The author mentions that the wife should handle the \"bulk\" of child work and housework. However, parenting is a shared responsibility, even if one parent has more money. Studies have shown that when both parents work, the division of childcare often falls unevenly, with women still doing more even if they earn less. But in this case, the wife is earning less but not necessarily working less. Maybe she's a stay-at-home mom, but the question doesn't specify. If she's working, then expecting her to do most of the housework might be unfair, especially if her income is lower because she's working part-time or in a lower-paying job. \n\nThe author also mentions that without their income, the family wouldn't survive. But that's a bit of a logical fallacy. The wife's income, though smaller, still contributes, and the housework isn't about survival but about maintaining a household. The author might be conflating financial responsibility with domestic labor. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation of \"management.\" The author wants their wife to organize everything. Management tasks can be time-consuming and stressful. If the wife is already doing a lot, adding managerial duties without a corresponding reduction in her other chores could be a burden. It's possible the author is shifting responsibility without considering the wife's capacity or willingness.\n\nThere's also the issue of mutual agreement. If this is a constant disagreement, it suggests that their expectations aren't aligned. The author might not have discussed this with their wife, assuming their viewpoint is justified. Healthy relationships require negotiation and compromise on household duties, regardless of income. Assuming that higher income justifies less domestic work could lead to resentment on both sides.\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. Traditional gender roles often assign more domestic duties to women, but modern relationships ideally move towards equality. The author's stance might reflect outdated notions of gender roles rather than a fair assessment of both partners' contributions. Even if the wife is doing less, it's important to consider her perspective and whether she feels overburdened.\n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting chores equally might be more equitable than basing it on income. The author's reasoning that \"I pay more, so you should work more\" could be seen as transactional, which might not foster a healthy partnership. Relationships thrive on mutual respect and shared responsibilities, not on a trade-off system.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's expectation that their higher income entitles them to less housework is problematic. It overlooks the non-monetary contributions the wife makes and might perpetuate unequal gender roles. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their reasoning is based on an unfair assumption about income and domestic labor.\n"
