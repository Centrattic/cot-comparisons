I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband expecting his wife to do more housework and childcare because he earns more than her. He makes four times her income and feels he's funding most of the household, so he expects her to handle more domestic responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. Traditionally, there's been an idea that the higher earner should handle more financial responsibilities while the other manages the home. But modern views often emphasize shared responsibilities regardless of income. The key here is whether the husband's expectations are fair or if they place an undue burden on his wife.\n\nThe husband mentions that he's not asking her to do four times the chores, but expects her to manage everything and take on the bulk of child and housework. However, he also states that without his income, they couldn't afford basic needs. This could imply he's not contributing equally to the household chores and childcare, which are equally important aspects of running a home.\n\nIt's important to recognize that housework and childcare are not just chores but essential tasks that require time and effort. Assuming that because he earns more he's entitled to less domestic work might be problematic. Studies and articles often discuss how gender roles can influence these expectations, and even when both partners work, sharing domestic duties is considered fair.\n\nThe wife might feel overwhelmed if she's handling most of the childcare and housework on top of her job. The husband's argument that he's funding the home might overlook the non-monetary contributions his wife makes. A healthy relationship typically involves mutual support and shared responsibilities, not just splitting tasks based on income.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's question implies a sense of entitlement. He might be framing the situation as a trade-off where his financial contribution justifies less domestic work. However, this approach can lead to resentment from the wife if she's not being acknowledged for her efforts or if the workload is imbalanced.\n\nIn many cases, couples negotiate and adjust their roles based on their strengths and circumstances. If the wife is capable and willing to take on more chores, that's one thing, but if the division is causing constant conflict, it's a sign that the current arrangement isn't working for both parties. The husband's insistence on her doing more, especially if it's not a mutual agreement, could be seen as unfair.\n\nSo, considering these points, the husband's expectations might be considered unreasonable. It's about fairness in contributions, not just splitting based on income. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong.\n"
