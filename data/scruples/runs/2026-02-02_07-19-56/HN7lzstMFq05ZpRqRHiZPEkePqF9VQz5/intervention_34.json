I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because he earns more. The question is about fairness in household responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the assumptions made by the author. He argues that since he makes four times more money, he's funding most of the household, so his wife should handle more of the chores. But is income directly proportional to household duties? There's a common belief that higher earners should take on more, but that's not necessarily a universal standard. Relationships are based on mutual agreements, not just financial contributions.\n\nThe author mentions expecting his wife to be the \"management\" and do the bulk of child and housework. This could imply he's not contributing equally. Even if he's the primary breadwinner, domestic responsibilities aren't just about money. Emotional labor, childcare, and home management are significant and should be shared. Assuming one person should handle all of that because they earn less might be unfair to the wife.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" sounds dismissive of her contributions and might come off as condescending. It's possible the author isn't recognizing her efforts or the non-monetary value she brings. Relationships require teamwork, and expecting unequal contributions based on income could lead to resentment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if the wife is okay with this arrangement, it's her choice. But the question is about fairness, not just consent. The user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, and I agree. The key issue is whether income should dictate responsibilities and if the author's expectations are respectful of his wife's role. The answer here is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
