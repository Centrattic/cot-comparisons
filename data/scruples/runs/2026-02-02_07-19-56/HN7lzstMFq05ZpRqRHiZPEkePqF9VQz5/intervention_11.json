I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband expecting his wife to do more housework and child-related tasks because he earns four times more than she does. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is making more money and feels that, since he's the primary earner, the wife should handle more domestic responsibilities. But the question is whether that's a fair expectation.\n\nI remember that in many relationships, the division of labor isn't strictly based on income. Even if one partner earns more, household responsibilities often require cooperation from both. The husband is suggesting that the wife should manage everything else because he's paying most of the bills. But does income alone justify that?\n\nThere's a common belief that both partners should contribute to household duties regardless of earnings. Expecting someone to do more just because the other earns more might be seen as unfair. It could perpetuate traditional gender roles where the higher-earning partner expects the other to handle domestic tasks, which can lead to resentment.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head.\" That sounds like he's implying the wife's contribution isn't necessary, which is problematic. Both partners contribute in different ways, and their roles aren't necessarily tied to income.\n\nThe key point is whether expecting a spouse to do more housework based on earnings is fair. Studies and relationship experts often suggest that fairness in chores is about mutual agreement and what each partner can handle, not income. So the husband's reasoning might not hold up in terms of equity.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A). He's making an assumption about his wife's responsibilities based on his income, which isn't a valid basis for dividing labor. Healthy relationships require communication and shared responsibility, not one-sided expectations based on financial contributions.\n"
