I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times as much. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and fairness. Traditionally, higher income might be linked to more responsibility, but times are changing. People now often advocate for equal sharing regardless of income. But does that apply here?\n\nThe author argues that since he's the primary earner, he expects his wife to handle more domestic tasks and childcare. He mentions not expecting a 4x ratio but wants her to manage things and take the bulk. The key here is the assumption that financial contribution directly translates to other responsibilities.\n\nWait, but is it fair to tie domestic work to income? Some might say yes, if one person is working more, the other can handle home duties. But others might argue that both partners should share equally, regardless of income. Also, childcare is a shared responsibility, right? If the wife is handling most of it, maybe that's a point of contention.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that without his income, they can't afford things, so she should contribute more elsewhere. But does that logic hold? Maybe the wife's lower income is due to factors like part-time work for childcare, so expecting her to do all the housework could be unfair. Also, emotional labor, like managing schedules and tasks, is tiring and often unrecognized.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The couple has had this disagreement for four years. Maybe they need to talk about their expectations instead of assuming roles. The author might be imposing traditional gender roles without considering his wife's perspective. Modern relationships often emphasize teamwork and mutual agreement rather than strict roles based on income.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's expecting her to do more because he earns more, that might not be fair. The wife's contribution to the household, especially childcare, is significant and shouldn't be discounted. Assuming she should handle management and bulk tasks because he's the main earner could be seen as unfair, as it doesn't account for her possible limitations or the emotional labor involved.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because he's not considering shared responsibilities and mutual effort regardless of income.\n"
