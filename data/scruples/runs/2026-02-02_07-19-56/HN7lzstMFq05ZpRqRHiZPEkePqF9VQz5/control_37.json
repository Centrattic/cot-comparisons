I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband makes four times more money than his wife and expects her to handle more housework and childcare, arguing that since he's funding most of the expenses, she should contribute more in other ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband is suggesting that because he's the primary earner, his wife should take on more domestic responsibilities. But traditional gender roles often assign the majority of housework and childcare to women, even when they earn less. So, this might be a case of the husband expecting his wife to follow those traditional roles, which can be problematic because it's based on outdated stereotypes rather than a fair division of labor.\n\nThen, there's the question of fairness. Just because one partner earns more doesn't necessarily mean they should do less around the house. Relationships are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. Expecting the wife to do more because the husband is providing financially could be seen as taking her contributions for granted. Financial contribution is just one aspect of a partnership; emotional and physical labor are equally important.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" implies a sense of ownership or obligation, which is not a healthy dynamic. Both partners have different roles and responsibilities that are vital to the household. The husband's argument might be overlooking the value of his wife's work, even if it's not as visible as his financial contributions.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the wife. If she's already handling a lot of childcare and housework, adding more without considering her capacity or willingness could lead to burnout or resentment. It's important to communicate and negotiate responsibilities rather than assuming based on income.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that if both partners agree to this arrangement, it's acceptable. But the key here is that it's a constant disagreement, indicating that they haven't reached an agreement. The husband's approach seems to be dictating the terms based on his income, which can be seen as unfair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband is likely in the wrong because he's enforcing traditional roles and not considering the need for a balanced, mutual contribution to household duties. The answer should be A.\n"
