I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a married couple where the husband makes four times as much as the wife and expects her to take on more household and childcare responsibilities. He argues that since he's the main financial provider, she should contribute more in other ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The question is whether expecting more housework from the wife is fair, especially given the income disparity. In many modern perspectives, equality in chores and responsibilities is emphasized, regardless of who earns more. But there's also the argument that financial contribution might influence expectations of other contributions.\n\nThe husband mentions that he's not saying she has to do four times the chores, but he's expecting her to manage everything and take on the bulk of child and housework. The key here is the assumption that because he's the main earner, she should handle more domestic tasks. However, traditional gender roles often assign more domestic duties to women, which can be seen as unfair in today's context.\n\nI should also think about the underlying assumptions. The husband's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head\" implies that his income is the sole reason they can afford the home, which might not be entirely true if they are a team. Plus, the wife's income, even if smaller, does contribute, even if it's less than his.\n\nAnother point is the expectation of \"management\" roles. Who manages the household isn't necessarily tied to who earns more. Many couples share responsibilities based on what each person can do, not just income. The husband is essentially asking the wife to take on more responsibility in managing, which might be a traditional role but doesn't have to be exclusive.\n\nAlso, the idea that the wife should do more because he's funding most might be a form of gender bias. It could be seen as the husband not valuing the non-monetary contributions the wife already makes, such as emotional labor, childcare, etc. Dividing chores fairly is more about mutual agreement and respect rather than income-based contributions.\n\nIn many relationships, fairness is about balance, not necessarily equal division of labor. If one person works more outside the home, the other might take on more at home, but that's a mutual decision. The husband's expectation here might be based on outdated norms rather than a fair, consensual arrangement.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the husband's reasoning might be rooted in traditional gender roles rather than a fair consideration of both partners' contributions. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for assuming that his higher income automatically means the wife should take on more domestic responsibilities."
