I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a husband who earns four times what his wife does and is upset that she isn't doing more housework and childcare. He's essentially saying that because he provides most of the income, she should handle more of the domestic responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is making a case based on financial contribution, expecting that his higher income entitles him to less responsibility at home. But is that a fair assumption? In many relationships, people split chores based on time availability, personal preferences, or other factors, not just income. \n\nOne thing to note is that the author is not considering his wife's contributions beyond just housework. Maybe she has a job, which takes time and energy. Even if she earns less, her job might require similar hours or stress. The idea that income alone dictates household responsibilities can be problematic because it might overlook the wife's efforts and could lead to resentment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that if not for him, their child wouldn't have a roof or food. While it's true that he's contributing financially, marriage typically involves mutual support. The wife might be contributing in other ways, like managing the household, taking care of the child, or balancing her own job. The author's perspective might be coming from a place of expecting traditional gender roles, which isn't necessarily fair in a modern context where shared responsibilities are encouraged.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved in managing the household and child-rearing. That's a significant part of housework and is often undervalued. The author might be dismissing the mental and emotional effort his wife puts into these tasks. \n\nThe key issue here is the assumption that higher income justifies less involvement in domestic duties. This could be seen as the author not sharing the load equally, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. The question is whether expecting the higher-earning spouse to do less is fair. Many would argue that fairness in a relationship isn't strictly about splitting tasks based on income but about mutual respect and shared responsibilities based on each person's capacity and preferences.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's not acknowledging the value of his wife's contributions and is using his income as a reason to expect her to take on more without considering their mutual agreement or the effort involved in her current responsibilities. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
