I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework since they earn four times as much. The user thinks the author is wrong, but they want to know the community's opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments presented. The author believes that because they contribute more financially, they should expect their wife to handle more household responsibilities. They mention that the wife isn't doing 4x the chores but should manage things and take on most of the childcare and housework. \n\nNow, I should think about common perspectives on this issue. Financial contribution often plays a role in expectations regarding domestic responsibilities, but it's not a straightforward equation. Many people argue that fairness isn't about splitting tasks proportionally to income but about mutual effort and shared responsibility. \n\nThe author's reasoning might come from a traditional view where the higher earner expects the other to handle more domestic duties. However, modern discussions often emphasize equality in shared tasks regardless of income. Even if one person earns more, both partners are still expected to contribute to the household. \n\nAlso, the situation mentions that this is a constant disagreement, which suggests that communication isn't working. The wife might feel that her contribution is undervalued or that the author is not pulling their weight. The author's argument could be seen as using their income as a justification to avoid sharing the workload equally. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved in managing the household. The author mentions expecting the wife to be the \"management\" and track everything. Emotional labor is a significant part of housework, and if the author isn't taking that on, it adds to the wife's burden. \n\nIt's also important to note that in many relationships, both partners contribute in different ways beyond just income. The wife might be handling childcare, which is time-consuming and physically demanding. The author might not be considering the non-monetary contributions of their wife, such as caring for the child, which is crucial even if it doesn't involve income. \n\nMoreover, the question of fairness isn't just about splitting tasks based on income. It's about mutual respect, shared responsibilities, and ensuring that both partners feel valued. The author's approach might be seen as placing more pressure on the wife to compensate for their lack of involvement in domestic tasks, which could be unfair. \n\nIn summary, while the author has a valid point about contributing more financially, expecting the wife to handle the majority of housework and childcare might not consider the balance of contributions and the emotional labor involved. The key issue here is whether both partners are sharing responsibilities in a way that feels fair to both, not just based on income disparity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing the need for a more equitable distribution of household duties, regardless of their financial contribution.\n"
