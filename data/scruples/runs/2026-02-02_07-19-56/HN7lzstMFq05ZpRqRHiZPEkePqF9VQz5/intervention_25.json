I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times more. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their partnership. The key point here is the expectation based on income. The author is making a financial argument, suggesting that since he contributes more monetarily, his wife should take on more domestic responsibilities. \n\nBut wait, relationships aren't just about money. Emotional labor, time, and personal circumstances matter too. Maybe the wife has other responsibilities or limitations that aren't mentioned here. For example, maybe she's working a job that's mentally taxing, or perhaps she's handling other aspects of parenting that aren't as visible. The author assumes that higher income equals more contribution, but that's not necessarily the case. \n\nAlso, the idea that one person's income should dictate the division of labor can be problematic. It might set up an unequal dynamic where the lower-earning partner feels they have to compensate in other ways, which can lead to resentment. The author is essentially saying that because he's funding most of the household, his wife should handle the rest. But that's not always fair. \n\nWhat about the child care part? The author mentions that the wife should take on the bulk of child work. If they're both working, maybe their schedules affect this. Maybe she's working less hours, or her job is more flexible, allowing her to manage more at home. But the question is whether it's fair to base expectations solely on income. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual agreement. How was the division of labor decided when they started? If there was an understanding, and now the author is changing the expectations, that's an issue. Plus, expecting the wife to manage everything could add stress and imbalance. \n\nI think the author might be overlooking the non-monetary contributions his wife makes. The assumption that income equals contribution is a common but flawed one. Relationships require teamwork, communication, and fairness, not just a transactional approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). He's making an unfair assumption based on income and not considering other factors. It's not about who earns more but how they both contribute in ways that feel balanced to both partners.\n"
