I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The key points here are income disparity and division of household labor.\n\nFirst, the author makes four times more than their wife. They argue that since they fund most of the household, their wife should handle more chores and childcare. They mention expecting her to be the \"management\" and do the bulk of the work. They also question if they're an asshole for this expectation.\n\nNow, considering traditional gender roles, it's common for the higher-earning partner to be the primary breadwinner, but this doesn't necessarily mean the other partner should handle all the domestic duties. However, societal norms are changing, and many couples now aim for a more equal division of labor regardless of income. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife is working and contributing financially, even if less, she's still contributing. The author's argument is based on the idea that financial contribution should dictate domestic responsibilities, but that's a contentious viewpoint. It might be seen as unfair to expect the lower-earning partner to take on more household work, especially since both partners are likely working and balancing other commitments like childcare.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that without their income, the family can't afford basic needs. While this is true, it's important to consider that financial stability is a joint responsibility, and the wife's income, though smaller, still contributes. Expecting her to manage all the household tasks could be seen as placing an undue burden on her, especially if she's also working.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved in managing the household. The author wants her to be the \"management,\" which includes keeping track of everything. This is a significant part of housework and shouldn't be underestimated. If the author isn't contributing to managing the household, that's an imbalance. \n\nHowever, the author's stance is that they fund most of the house, so their contribution should be recognized in other ways. But equating financial contribution directly to domestic labor isn't straightforward. Each partner's contributions should be balanced in a way that's fair to both, considering their individual circumstances and capacities.\n\nIn many relationships, a more equitable approach is to divide tasks based on what each partner can do, rather than income. If the author is working longer hours due to their higher income, maybe they could take on more tasks at home. The key is communication and mutual agreement rather than expecting it based on income.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're making an assumption that higher income justifies expecting more domestic work from the other partner. This perspective can be seen as outdated or unfair, as it doesn't account for the value of both partners' time and efforts. The wife's work, both financial and domestic, should be equally respected. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering a more balanced approach and for framing the expectation as justified by income.\n"
