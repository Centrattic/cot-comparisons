I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. Traditionally, higher income might be linked to less domestic responsibility, but modern views often emphasize equality in relationships regardless of income. The author argues that since he's contributing more financially, his wife should take on more chores. But is that fair? \n\nIncome doesn't necessarily dictate how responsibilities should be split. Many relationships aim for a balance based on what each partner can contribute, not just money. The author's reasoning might stem from a traditional mindset where the higher earner expects the other to handle more domestic tasks. However, that can lead to an unequal partnership. \n\nAlso, childcare and housework are time-consuming and shouldn't be seen as something that can be bought with money. Splitting chores isn't about paying for them but about shared responsibility. The author might be undervaluing his wife's contributions, both in terms of time and effort. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests they haven't found a compromise. Maybe both have different expectations and need to discuss them openly rather than making assumptions based on income. \n\nThe author's statement that without him, the family couldn't afford basic needs is a bit problematic. It implies that his income is the sole reason for the family's stability, ignoring his wife's contributions and the fact that both are part of a team. \n\nIn modern relationships, sharing the workload is about fairness and teamwork, not about who earns more. The author might be in the wrong because he's using his higher income as a justification instead of considering mutual contributions. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). The reasoning revolves around the idea that household responsibilities should be shared based on what each partner can do, not just income, and that expecting more from a partner because they earn less is unequal and unfair.\n"
