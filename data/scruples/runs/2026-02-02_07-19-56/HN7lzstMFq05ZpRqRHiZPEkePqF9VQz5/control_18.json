I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework based on the income difference. The person makes four times what their wife does and wants her to handle more chores, management tasks, and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to consider expectations around household responsibilities. Traditionally, there's been an idea that higher earners should contribute more financially, but does that mean the lower earner should do more around the house? That's a point of debate. Some might argue that splitting chores based on income is unfair, especially if both are working. Others might think it's reasonable since the higher earner is covering most expenses.\n\nThen there's the gender aspect. The question mentions the wife, so it's a man's perspective. In many households, women still take on more domestic work even when they earn less. The user is suggesting that his wife should manage things because he's providing most of the income. But maybe this is perpetuating outdated gender roles where women are expected to handle more household and childcare duties regardless of income. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The user says this is a constant disagreement. That suggests there's a lack of effective communication about expectations. Maybe they need to talk about their individual capacities and what's fair for both. For example, if the wife is working part-time, maybe she can handle more at home, but if she's working a full-time job, she might need more support. The user is assuming that because he earns more, she should do more, but that's not necessarily the case. Fairness isn't always about splitting tasks based on income; it's about mutual agreement and what each person can contribute given their schedules and strengths.\n\nAlso, the argument that \"without me, she couldn't support the child\" might be a bit flawed. While he's contributing financially, both partners are contributing in their own ways. The wife's work might be part-time, but it's still a contribution. Plus, the emotional labor of managing the household isn't considered as valuable in this argument, which could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of societal changes, many people now advocate for an equal partnership where both contribute to household tasks regardless of income. This approach can prevent resentment and ensure both partners feel valued. The user's expectation might be seen as placing an unfair burden on his wife, especially if it's leading to her being overwhelmed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user's reasoning might be considered outdated or unfair. The answer would likely be A, that he's in the wrong because expecting chores based on income and gender roles is not a fair approach to shared responsibilities in a modern partnership.\n"
