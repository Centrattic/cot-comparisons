I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. He makes four times what she does and wants her to handle more chores, management tasks, child care, etc. He's asking if he's an asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main point is that since he provides most of the income, his wife should contribute more in other areas. But is that a valid expectation? There's a common debate about whether financial contributions should dictate household responsibilities. Some people believe in an equal split of chores regardless of income, while others think the person earning less might take on more household tasks to balance the financial load.\n\nHowever, the key here is the assumption that higher income equals less responsibility for household work. This can be seen as traditional gender roles, where the higher-earning spouse (often the man) expects the lower-earning one (often the woman) to handle domestic duties. That might be considered outdated or unfair in a modern, equal partnership.\n\nAlso, the author mentions wanting his wife to take on the \"bulk\" of the child work and housework. Even if the income is higher, expecting someone to do the majority of the work without considering their own time and energy could be problematic. Relationships are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities, not just dividing tasks based on who earns more.\n\nAnother angle is the idea that contributing financially is one aspect of a partnership, but emotional labor, like managing the household, is also significant. Both types of contributions are important, and assuming someone's role based on income might overlook the value of their other contributions.\n\nThe author might be coming from a place of feeling that his financial support justifies more help at home. But it's possible that the expectation is setting up an unequal dynamic where the wife feels she's not getting enough support, leading to resentment. The question is whether his expectation is reasonable or if it's placing an unfair burden on his wife.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, many modern relationships aim for an equal division of labor, regardless of income. So, expecting the lower-earning partner to do more chores could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles, which the AITA community often criticizes. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for making that assumption without considering mutual agreement or their wife's perspective.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't keep...\" comes off as dismissive of his wife's contributions and possibly undermines her role in the household. It might imply that his financial input is the only important factor, which isn't the case. A healthy relationship requires valuing each other's contributions beyond just money.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A). His expectation is based on traditional gender roles and doesn't account for mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The wife's input, both financially and in terms of household work, is valuable, and expecting her to do the bulk of the work solely because he earns more is unfair.\n"
