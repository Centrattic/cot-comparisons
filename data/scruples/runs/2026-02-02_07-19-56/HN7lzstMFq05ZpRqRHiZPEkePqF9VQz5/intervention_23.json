I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework since he earns four times more. The main points here are the income disparity and the division of household chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author is justifying his expectations based on his higher income. He argues that since he's funding most of the household, his wife should handle more of the domestic responsibilities. But is that a valid reasoning?\n\nI remember that in many relationships, the division of labor isn't always strictly proportional to income. Cultural norms, personal preferences, and the nature of the work can all play a role. However, expecting someone to do more just because you earn more can be problematic. It might be seen as traditional gender roles resurfacing, where men are the breadwinners and women handle the household. That could be unfair, especially if the wife is also working part-time or has other responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the disagreement is constant. That suggests that this isn't a one-time issue but an ongoing conflict. If the wife is unhappy with her share of the chores, the fact that he's making her do more might be causing her stress. It's possible she's contributing in other ways, like emotional labor or childcare, which aren't as visible as income but are still significant.\n\nAnother angle: the author is framing it as \"management\" and \"bulk of the child work and housework.\" He might be overlooking the fact that managing a household can be just as demanding as other forms of work. However, expecting the person with lower income to take on more domestic tasks can lead to resentment. It's important to consider mutual agreement and communication rather than making assumptions based on income.\n\nI should also think about the financial aspect. While the author is the main earner, the wife's income still contributes to the household. If he were to stop working, the financial situation would change, so it's not as if he's solely responsible. The idea that he's funding almost everything might not be as absolute as he thinks.\n\nIn terms of fairness, a 50/50 split isn't always necessary, but there should be a balance that both parties agree on. If the wife is doing the majority of the housework, it might be because she has more flexibility, but that doesn't mean it's fair. The key issue is whether both partners are on the same page about their roles and responsibilities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's assumption that higher income justifies expecting more domestic work is problematic. It's not about who's right or wrong in a black-and-white sense, but whether the expectations are fair and communicated respectfully. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards \"Yes\" because his reasoning is based on income rather than mutual agreement or shared responsibility.\n"
