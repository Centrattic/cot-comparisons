      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The question is about expecting the wife to do more housework because he earns more. The user is asking if that makes him the asshole in the situation. \n\nFirst, I should consider the general views on this topic. There's a lot of debate about whether income should determine how household chores are divided. Some people argue that because one person makes more money, they should handle financial responsibilities, and the other can take care of the house. Others say that housework is a shared responsibility regardless of income.\n\nThe author says he makes almost four times what his wife does. He's not saying she has to do four times the chores, but he expects her to manage the household and take on most of the child and housework. He feels that since he's funding most of the expenses, she should contribute in other ways. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to assume that the person who earns more should do less housework? I remember some studies suggesting that in dual-income households, even when one partner earns more, the other still ends up doing a significant portion of domestic work. However, that doesn't necessarily mean it's fair. The key here might be the expectation and how it's communicated. \n\nThe author mentions that his wife isn't doing the bulk of the chores, which is a source of constant disagreement. Maybe the issue isn't just about the amount of work but how it's distributed. If the wife is already doing a lot and the author is adding more expectations based on income, that could be problematic. Also, the idea that he's \"funding the operation\" might be a bit of a mindset where he feels entitled to less household labor, which could be seen as traditional gender roles resurfacing. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved in managing the household. Even if someone isn't doing the physical chores, keeping track of everything (like schedules, grocery lists, etc.) is a significant task. If the author is shifting that responsibility onto his wife, even though she's working, it could be adding to her workload. \n\nI should also think about the potential for gender bias here. The author and his wife are married, and the wife is working, but the author is emphasizing her lower income. Even if income is a factor, does that justify a lopsided division of labor? Many modern relationships aim for an equal split regardless of income, but some people might have different arrangements. However, expecting the partner with less income to take on more housework could be seen as unfair, especially if the higher-earning partner isn't contributing in other meaningful ways. \n\nThe author is asking if he's an asshole. The phrase \"AITA\" is a bit humorous but underscores the seriousness of the question. The answer probably depends on cultural norms, the couple's agreement, and how the expectations are enforced. If the wife feels overburdened, that's a red flag. But the author is making an argument based on income, which might not be a valid justification for unequal distribution of work. \n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because expecting the partner with lower income to do more housework because the higher earner is contributing financially could perpetuate unequal gender roles and place an unfair burden on the wife. Housework and child-rearing are typically seen as shared responsibilities in many modern relationships, especially if both partners are working. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
