I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework since he earns more. The title says he makes almost four times what she does and he's arguing that because he's contributing more financially, she should handle more of the domestic responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common arguments around this topic. Traditionally, some people might say that when one partner earns more, they're in a better position to earn money while the other can focus on household duties. But modern perspectives often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of income. \n\nThe key points here are: the wife's income is lower, but does that justify expecting her to do more housework? Financial contribution doesn't necessarily translate to equitable sharing of domestic labor. Many relationships aim for a balance where each partner contributes according to their abilities and time, not just income. The author is assuming that higher income equals less need to handle chores, but that might not be fair. The wife might have her own reasons for not contributing more, like time constraints, personal preferences, or other responsibilities. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that if not for him, they wouldn't have a roof or food. But the wife's role in raising the child and managing the household is also crucial. The question of fairness isn't just about who pays the bills but about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that their expectations aren't aligned. Instead of expecting her to do more based on his income, maybe they need to discuss how to divide tasks in a way that works for both of them, considering their work hours, personal strengths, and other commitments. \n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because he's making assumptions based on income rather than fostering a collaborative approach. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
