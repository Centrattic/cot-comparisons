I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a husband who makes four times as much as his wife. They have a child and a kid. He's saying that because he brings in most of the income, he expects his wife to do more housework and manage things, like being the \"management\" and handling most of the childcare and chores. He's asking if he's an asshole for expecting that, and the user thinks he is, but they want others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the common perspectives on this. In many relationships, the expectation of dividing household responsibilities can be a sensitive topic, especially when one partner earns significantly more. The author is arguing that since he contributes more financially, his wife should contribute more in other ways. However, this line of reasoning is often seen as problematic because it's a traditional gender role assumption, even though the wife is working and earning her own income.\n\nI remember reading about relationship advice that suggests the person who earns more should take on more of the financial burden, but not necessarily the domestic one. The idea is that both partners should share household responsibilities equally, regardless of income. This is because both are contributing to the household in different ways\u2014financially and through labor.\n\nAnother angle is the time and energy each person has. If the wife is working, she's also contributing to the household's income, so expecting her to do all the housework and childcare might be unfair. It could lead to burnout for her, especially with a child involved. Also, the author's argument that without his income, they couldn't afford things, but that's a given for most dual-income households. The wife's income still contributes, even if it's less. \n\nThere's also the issue of assuming that managing the household is her role just because he makes more. That can reinforce stereotypes about women being the primary caregivers and homemakers, which many people now try to move away from. It's important to have mutual respect and shared responsibilities. \n\nHowever, there might be exceptions if one partner has less capacity to do chores due to other commitments or health reasons. But in the given scenario, the wife is working, so the author's expectation might not hold up. The key is communication and agreement on how to split responsibilities based on mutual consent and circumstances, not just income.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is making an argument that's based on traditional gender roles and the assumption that his higher income entitles him to less domestic work. This is generally considered unfair in modern perspectives. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
