I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their wife to handle more housework and childcare since they earn four times more. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that because they contribute more financially, the wife should take on more domestic responsibilities. They mention expecting her to manage things and do the bulk of the chores and childcare. The key here is the assumption that financial contribution directly translates to responsibility for other chores.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and mutual expectations in relationships. Traditionally, higher earners might expect more domestic support, but modern viewpoints often emphasize equal partnership regardless of income. The author's argument is based on the idea that their financial input justifies more chores from the wife. However, this could be seen as outdated or unfair, as it implies that the wife's contribution isn't equally valuable in maintaining the household.\n\nAlso, the presence of a child complicates things. Childcare is a shared responsibility, and expecting one partner to handle it more just because they earn less might not be fair. Studies show that shared responsibilities lead to better mental health for both partners. The author might be overlooking the non-monetary contributions of their wife, like emotional labor or time management.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that their expectations aren't aligned. It's possible that the wife feels her job and the domestic work are equally important, and the author's expectation isn't considering her workload. The question is whether the author is wrong in making this assumption.\n\nIn relationships, fairness isn't always about splitting tasks equally but about what each partner can contribute given their circumstances. The author's stance might be seen as exploiting their higher income to shift more domestic duties to their spouse, which could be considered unfair. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are not recognizing that household responsibilities should be shared based on mutual agreement rather than financial contribution.\n"
