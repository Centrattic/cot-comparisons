I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. So the main issue here is the division of household responsibilities based on income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common societal norms and what's generally accepted. Traditionally, maybe there was an idea that the higher earner should handle financial aspects while the other handles domestic tasks. But times have changed, and many relationships now emphasize shared responsibilities regardless of income. \n\nThe author argues that since he earns almost four times more, his wife should manage more of the housework and childcare. He's not saying 4x the chores, but more. But is this fair? Well, income doesn't necessarily dictate the division of labor. Relationships are based on mutual respect and agreement. Assuming that higher income justifies more domestic work from the other partner could be seen as unfair because it's not about who earns more but about shared partnership.\n\nAlso, the argument that he's funding most of the household might imply that he's making the financial contributions, so she should handle the rest. But in reality, both financial and domestic contributions are part of a partnership. The wife might be contributing in other ways, and expecting her to take on more just because he earns more could be seen as transactional, which might not be healthy.\n\nAnother angle: if they have a child, childcare is a shared responsibility. It's not about who earns more but about both parents supporting each other. The author might be placing an unfair burden on his wife, expecting her to manage everything else while he's the main earner. This could lead to resentment on her part if she feels overwhelmed.\n\nAdditionally, the question of fairness often depends on the agreement between the couple. If they had discussed and agreed on roles, that's one thing. But the fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that their expectations aren't aligned. The author's expectation might not consider his wife's perspective or her own contributions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. Because expecting someone to handle more chores based on income without mutual agreement can be seen as unfair, especially since relationships should involve shared responsibilities and mutual support regardless of financial contributions.\n"
