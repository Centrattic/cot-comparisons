I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework?

AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. The author makes almost four times what his wife does and feels that since he's funding most of the household, she should handle more of the chores and child care. He's asking if he's an asshole (AITA) for that expectation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the general societal norms regarding household responsibilities. In many cultures, there's a shift towards more equal distribution of chores regardless of income, but there's also the idea that the person with higher income might have more flexibility. However, this isn't a strict rule and varies a lot between individuals and relationships.\n\nThe key points here are the author's justification based on income and the assumption that his wife should take on more. But household responsibilities aren't necessarily tied to income. Even if one person earns more, the other might have other constraints, like part-time work, education, or health issues. Also, emotional labor, like managing schedules and tasks, is a significant part of housework that's often undervalued.\n\nThe author's argument is that since he's contributing more financially, he expects more domestic work from his wife. However, this can be seen as transactional, treating marriage like a business where contributions are measured in dollars. Relationships are usually based on mutual respect and understanding rather than a strict exchange of services. Moreover, the author mentions they have a child, which adds to the complexity. Childcare isn't just a domestic task; it's a parental responsibility shared between both parents, regardless of income.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for gender stereotypes. The author might be enforcing traditional roles where the woman handles more household duties because of her income level, which could be viewed as outdated. The idea that the higher-earning spouse should have less domestic responsibility is a common debate, but it's not universally accepted. Some couples do split chores based on time availability rather than income, especially if the lower-earning spouse has more time.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable if there's a perceived imbalance, but the way he frames his expectations might come off as entitlement. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that communication is lacking. The best approach would be to discuss as a team what works for both of them, rather than assigning tasks based on financial contributions.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong, if he's insisting that his wife must take on more because he's earning more, without considering her input or circumstances, he could be. Relationships require compromise and mutual agreement. Assuming that someone must contribute more in one area (income) means they can offload another (chores) isn't fair unless both parties agree. The author's statement implies a sense of ownership over the household's financial state, which can lead to resentment from his wife if she feels her contributions aren't valued equally.\n\nAlso, the mention of \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" is a classic example of not recognizing her contributions. Even if he's providing most of the income, she's likely contributing in other ways, and downplaying that can be hurtful. It's important to acknowledge all forms of labor\u2014emotional, physical, and financial.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reasoning is problematic because it's based on income disparity rather than a balanced consideration of both partners' contributions and needs. The expectation that his wife should take on more because he earns more could be seen as unfair and not considering the other spouse's perspective. So, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
