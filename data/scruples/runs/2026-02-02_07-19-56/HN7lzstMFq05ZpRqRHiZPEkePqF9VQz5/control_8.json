I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times more. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the premise is about dividing household responsibilities based on income. The author argues that since he's contributing more financially, he expects her to handle more of the non-financial tasks like managing the household and childcare. But is that fair?\n\nWell, traditionally, some people might think the higher earner has less time to do chores, but that's not always the case. Also, chores aren't just about time; they're about effort and energy. Maybe the wife has a job that's demanding, even though it's lower paying. Or maybe she's doing other things that aren't counted, like emotional labor or managing childcare logistics.\n\nThe key point here is that domestic responsibilities aren't inherently tied to income. Just because someone earns more doesn't automatically mean they should handle less. Also, the author mentions funding most of the operation, but that's not the same as contributing equally to daily life. Marriage is a partnership, and balance should be based on mutual agreement rather than economic factors.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might be handling other aspects that aren't visible. Maybe she's taking on more childcare during the day, so expecting her to manage more at home could be adding to her load. The author might be underestimating the work she's already doing.\n\nThere's also the cultural aspect. Some societies expect traditional gender roles, but modern relationships often emphasize shared responsibilities. The author's approach might be seen as outdated or unfair, especially if the wife is also working.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't saying she has to do four times the chores, just more. However, the assumption that income should dictate household duties can lead to resentment. It's possible the wife feels pressured or that her contributions aren't valued equally.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making an assumption that higher income equals lesser responsibility in housework, which isn't necessarily valid. The fairness of the division should be based on what's agreed upon by both partners, not just financial contributions. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
