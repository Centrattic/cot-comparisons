I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn almost four times more. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and common advice about household responsibilities. Traditionally, there's been an expectation that the higher-earning spouse focuses on work while the other handles more domestic tasks. But modern discussions often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of income.\n\nThe author argues that since they make more, the wife should manage the household and child duties. But this assumes that financial contribution dictates domestic labor, which can perpetuate outdated gender roles. Even if both agree, it's important to consider mutual respect and shared efforts. The key point is whether expecting someone to take on more just because the other earns more is fair.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the wife \"couldn't keep the roof over our child's head\" without them. This implies a sense of control over resources, which might affect dynamics. However, financial contribution doesn't necessarily equate to entitlement to less domestic work. Healthy relationships usually involve balancing contributions beyond just money\u2014emotional support, childcare, etc.\n\nThe AITA community often addresses this. They usually stress communication and mutual agreement. If both parties are comfortable with the arrangement, maybe it's not a problem. But if it's causing constant conflict, it might be an issue. The author frames it as \"expecting\" rather than collaborating, which can lead to resentment.\n\nSo, expecting the wife to handle more because of higher income could be seen as the author reinforcing unequal expectations. Even if it's not legally or morally wrong, it might not be fair. The answer likely leans towards A (author in the wrong) because it's about equitable contribution, not just financial.\n"
