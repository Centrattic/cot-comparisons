I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author makes 4 times more money than his wife and expects her to do more housework and child-related tasks. He argues that since he's funding most of the household, she should contribute more in other areas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on domestic responsibilities. There's a traditional view where the higher earner expects the other to take care of the home, but modern views often emphasize equality regardless of income. The question is whether expecting more chores based on income is fair.\n\nThe author mentions \"management\" and the bulk of child work. But housework is a shared responsibility in many relationships. Even if one person earns more, that doesn't necessarily mean they shouldn't share equally in domestic tasks. Also, the argument that without his income, they couldn't support the child might be seen as minimizing his wife's contributions. She's contributing by working, and their child needs attention from both parents.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might be doing a lot already, but the author is expecting her to do even more because of his higher income. That could be unfair. Studies sometimes show that higher earners end up doing less housework because they expect it, but that's a general trend. Each case is different.\n\nThe key here is whether the expectation is reasonable. If the author is implying that his higher income justifies a lower share of chores, that's a traditional gender role that many people now see as outdated. The fact that they have a child might also mean both parents need to share responsibilities for the child's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reasoning might be flawed. He's assuming that higher income means the other person should do more housework, which isn't necessarily equitable. It's possible he's in the wrong because it's not fair to base domestic responsibilities solely on income. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
