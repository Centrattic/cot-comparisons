I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The author argues that since they make four times as much as their wife, the wife should handle more of the household chores and childcare. They mention that they fund almost the entire operation and feel it's fair for the wife to take on more domestic responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of distributing household chores based on income. There's a common belief that responsibilities should be divided equitably, but some people think that the person bringing in more money should work less at home. However, others argue that equality in domestic tasks is important regardless of income.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they contribute more financially, their spouse should compensate by doing more housework. But this might overlook the fact that both partners have other commitments, like work and family. The key question here is whether it's fair to expect a spouse to do more chores based on the other's higher income.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of shared responsibility. Even if one person earns more, household tasks are often considered shared responsibilities. The author's expectation that their wife should manage everything and take the bulk of the child and housework might not account for the wife's own workload and the fact that she's contributing in her own way. Also, the financial contribution is one aspect, but time and effort in domestic tasks are different. \n\nThere's also the issue of how these tasks are divided. Childcare and housework aren't just chores; they're essential for the family's well-being. Assuming the wife is already handling some of these tasks, expecting her to do more without considering her capacity might be unfair. Additionally, the argument that without the author's income, the family wouldn't be able to survive ignores the mutual contribution of both partners. The wife's role in managing the household and caring for the child is equally vital for the family's stability.\n\nMoreover, the situation has been a constant disagreement for four years, which suggests that communication and mutual understanding are lacking. The author's framing of the problem might be more about their own perspective than the actual fairness of the division. It's possible that both partners need to reassess their expectations and find a balance that works for them, rather than using income as a justification.\n\nIn many relationships, the division of labor is a personal matter, but societal norms are shifting towards more equality. The idea that one person's higher income justifies less domestic work is increasingly seen as outdated. Therefore, the author's reasoning might be considered unfair because it doesn't consider the value of emotional labor, childcare, and the mutual effort required in maintaining a household.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because expecting a spouse to do more housework solely based on higher income doesn't account for the shared responsibilities and can be seen as unfair. The focus should be on a balanced approach that considers both partners' contributions and capacities.\n"
