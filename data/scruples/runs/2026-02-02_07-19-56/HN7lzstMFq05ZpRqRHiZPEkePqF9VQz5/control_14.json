I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more income. The situation involves a married couple with one child, where the husband makes four times what his wife does. He's questioning if he's an a**hole for expecting her to manage the household and take on more responsibilities since he's the primary breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations around domestic responsibilities. Traditionally, there's been a gendered division of labor where men earn more and women handle household tasks. However, modern views often advocate for more equality regardless of income. The key here is whether expecting a spouse to contribute more because of higher income is fair.\n\nThe husband's argument is that since he's funding most of the household, his wife should compensate by doing more chores. But this assumes that financial contribution directly translates to needing more from the other person in terms of non-financial work. However, many people argue that both partners should share domestic responsibilities equally, regardless of income. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual agreement. If the couple hasn't discussed and agreed on a fair division of labor, expecting one person to take on more without their consent can lead to resentment. The wife might feel overburdened, especially if she's already juggling work and childcare. The husband's reasoning might overlook her contributions and the fact that she's also working, even if less in terms of salary.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the child. If the wife is handling most of the child's care and housework, it could affect her mental health and well-being, which in turn might affect the whole family. The husband's financial contribution doesn't negate the value of her work at home, which is often unpaid but essential.\n\nMoreover, the husband's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" implies a lack of partnership. It's possible he's not recognizing her role and the fact that she's also contributing in her job, even if it's part-time or lower paid. This could be seen as entitlement, where he feels his higher income gives him the right to demand more from her.\n\nIn terms of fairness, equality in a relationship typically means considering both partners' contributions. Just because one earns more doesn't mean they should do less at home. It's about balancing both financial and non-financial roles. The husband's expectation might be outdated or stem from traditional gender roles that don't apply in a modern, equal partnership.\n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint that if the husband is working longer hours due to his higher income, he might have less time to contribute, which could be balanced by the wife taking on more. But this should be a mutual agreement, not an unspoken expectation based on income. The problem arises when the division isn't discussed and agreed upon, leading to one person feeling exploited.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's expectation seems to be based on traditional roles rather than mutual respect and equality. The fact that he frames it as a question of being an a**hole suggests he's aware of potential issues with his stance. The answer would likely lean towards him being in the wrong because expecting unequal domestic work solely based on income isn't fair and could harm the relationship's balance.\n"
