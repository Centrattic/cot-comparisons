      "text": "Okay, so the question is whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is asking if they're an a**hole for expecting their wife to do more housework since they earn four times more. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is married for four years with a child. They mention that their wife isn't doing enough chores, but they want her to manage things and take on more child and housework. The reasoning is that since they earn four times more, they think that justifies the wife doing more. The key point here is the assumption that higher income should translate to the spouse doing more domestic work.\n\nI remember reading about the \"Second Shift\" concept, where working women come home and do all the household chores after their paid work. But in this case, the wife is earning less, so maybe the author expects her to handle more at home. But is that fair? \n\nMoney doesn't always equate to fairness in chores. Even if one person earns more, splitting chores based on income might not be the right approach. Each person's ability, time, and circumstances should matter. Also, the author mentions their income funds most of the house, but that's about financial contribution, not necessarily domestic labor. \n\nThe author's argument is that since they're the main earner, the wife should contribute more in other ways. However, expecting someone to manage everything just because the other earns more could be seen as traditional or even exploitative. It might not consider the wife's own work, her time, or her contributions. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"I'm funding almost the whole operation\" implies that financial contribution is the main currency here. But in a partnership, both people usually share responsibilities. Expecting the lower-earning spouse to do all the household work can create an imbalance and resentment. \n\nThere's also the aspect of gender roles here. The author is asking the wife to take on management and child-rearing, which are traditional female roles. This might reflect outdated views where men earn and women manage the home. Modern relationships often aim for equality, regardless of income. \n\nAnother angle: does the wife have a job? If she's working, maybe she's doing both paid work and most of the housework, which is a double burden. The author isn't considering her workload and is instead using their higher income as a reason to shift chores onto her. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting chores based on income can be problematic. For example, if the wife earns 25% and the husband 75%, does that mean she should do 25% of the chores? That math doesn't work because chores aren't easily quantifiable. Also, managing the household is a full-time job in itself, which the author might be underestimating. \n\nThe author's main issue is expecting the wife to handle most of the domestic responsibilities just because he earns more. This could lead to an unfair distribution of labor. Even if the husband is the primary earner, splitting chores equitably is important for a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong. They're using their income as a rationale to assign more work to the wife without considering the balance of contributions, the nature of domestic work, or modern notions of equality in partnerships. Expecting someone to do the bulk of chores just because you earn more isn't fair and can create resentment. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
