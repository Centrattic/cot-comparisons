I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expecting his wife to do more housework and childcare because he earns four times more than her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the problem. The author justifies his expectations by pointing out his higher income, implying that since he provides most of the financial support, she should take on more domestic responsibilities. However, this line of reasoning might be problematic. \n\nIn many relationships, the division of labor isn't necessarily tied to income. Both partners are typically expected to contribute to household chores and childcare, regardless of who earns more. The author is making an assumption that money equals contribution, which might not be fair. It's important to consider mutual respect and agreed-upon roles rather than using income as a metric.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the wife is not doing 4x the chores but wants her to take on the \"management\" and majority of the work. This could imply an unequal distribution that isn't based on mutual agreement. If the wife feels overburdened or if there's no open communication about their expectations, that's a red flag.\n\nAnother angle is the societal shift where shared responsibilities are becoming more common, even if one partner earns more. The idea that the higher earner should handle finances while the other does more housework is a traditional view that's increasingly seen as outdated. The author might be perpetuating unequal gender roles if the wife is doing most of the housework regardless of her income.\n\nBut there's also a part where the author says \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" which sounds like a veiled criticism. It suggests that his contribution is the only one that matters, which is unfair. Every relationship requires teamwork, and both partners contribute in different ways beyond just money.\n\nHowever, it's possible that the author's intent is to balance the workload based on his greater financial input. If both agreed on this arrangement, it might not be an issue. But since it's a constant disagreement, there's a lack of mutual understanding. The key here is whether the expectations are unreasonable and if they're leading to resentment.\n\nIn many cases, people expect equality in non-monetary contributions, not necessarily proportional to income. So expecting the wife to do more because he earns more could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that both partners should share domestic responsibilities, regardless of income disparity.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
