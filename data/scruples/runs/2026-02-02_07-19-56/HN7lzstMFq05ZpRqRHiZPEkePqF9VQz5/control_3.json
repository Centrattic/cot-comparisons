I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework since they earn four times as much. They've been married four years, have one kid, and this is a recurring issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the underlying assumptions here. The author is implying that because they contribute more financially, their wife should handle more domestic responsibilities. But is that a fair or traditional expectation? In many relationships, the division of labor isn't necessarily tied to income. Some couples split chores equally regardless of earnings, while others might have different arrangements based on their agreements or circumstances.\n\nThe key point is the assumption that financial contribution directly translates to how domestic duties should be divided. The author mentions not expecting her to do four times the chores, but still wants her to manage everything and take on the bulk of childcare and housework. This seems to be a common debate. On one hand, if one partner is working more hours for higher income, maybe they have less time for chores. On the other, expecting the other partner to take on more just because they can afford it financially might not consider their own workload or contributions, like emotional labor or the time they spend caring for the child.\n\nI should think about the fairness aspect. Even if the author is the primary breadwinner, housework and childcare are part of a shared responsibility in a partnership. Assuming that because they pay most of the bills, their wife should handle more chores might be seen as traditional but not necessarily just. It's important to consider mutual agreement and the actual capabilities of each partner. For example, maybe the wife is working part-time and still has a significant workload, or she might have health issues, or the child requires a lot of attention that should be shared.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the arrangement isn't discussed or agreed upon, and the wife feels overwhelmed or unappreciated, then the author might be contributing to an imbalance. The phrase \"if not for me\" suggests a sense of entitlement or lack of recognition for the wife's contributions. This could be a red flag. Relationships should be based on partnership and respect, not a transactional mindset where one's contribution is only measured in money.\n\nAlso, the term \"management\" refers to organizing tasks, which is a form of labor too. If the wife is already handling that, but the husband is not contributing to the tasks themselves, maybe the issue is that the husband isn't doing his part. Just expecting someone to manage without participating might not be fair.\n\nAnother angle is societal expectations. There's a shift in many cultures towards more equal sharing of domestic duties, regardless of income. So if the author is holding onto an old-school view that the higher earner doesn't need to do as much housework, that could be where they're wrong. But if both partners have agreed to a specific arrangement, then it's more about their mutual consent rather than right or wrong.\n\nThe answer depends on the context of their agreement. If the wife isn't doing anything and the husband is handling all, but in this case, the wife is already taking the bulk. The author is arguing that their wife should do more because they pay the bills. However, in many modern relationships, the idea is that all responsibilities are shared equally, not based on income. The husband's reasoning might be invalid because it's not just about who earns more, but about mutual respect and shared duties. So, the author could be in the wrong if they're not considering their wife's contributions and if there's no open communication about their roles. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
