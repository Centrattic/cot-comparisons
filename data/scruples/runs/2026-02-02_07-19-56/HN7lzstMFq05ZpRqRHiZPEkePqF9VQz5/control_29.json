I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework since he earns more. \n\nFirst, I need to consider traditional roles versus modern expectations. In some cultures, the higher-earning spouse might take on the role of the \"boss\" in household responsibilities, but that's shifting. Many people today advocate for equal sharing regardless of income. \n\nThe husband argues that because he makes four times more, the wife should manage more. But does income directly correlate with how chores should be divided? Maybe not. Housework isn't about money; it's about shared responsibilities. Both partners have their own challenges. The wife might be handling the child and other tasks while working, so balancing income with household duties isn't straightforward.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions funding most of the family expenses. However, this doesn't automatically mean the wife should take on more chores. Emotional labor, like managing schedules and child care, is significant too. If both are working, they might need to split tasks based on time and energy rather than income.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The fact that this is a constant disagreement suggests that expectations weren't aligned from the start. The husband might not have considered his wife's perspective or the balance she's already maintaining. \n\nIn terms of fairness, expecting someone to do more chores just because the other makes more could be seen as outdated. It might also lead to resentment if the wife feels exploited, even if she's contributing in other ways. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the husband's reasoning might be based on outdated norms. The key issue is whether the division of labor is fair and agreed upon by both parties. Since he's making it about income, which isn't the standard in many modern relationships, he might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
