I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who makes four times more money than his wife and expects her to take on more housework and childcare because he's contributing more financially. He's wondering if he's an asshole for expecting that.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is arguing that since he's the primary earner, his wife should handle more of the domestic responsibilities. But wait, isn't the idea that when one spouse earns more, the other might take on more household duties for the sake of balance? Or does that depend on the mutual agreement?\n\nThe key point here is whether the expectation is fair or not. The husband mentions that his wife isn't doing 4x the chores, but he expects her to manage everything and take the bulk of the childcare and housework. But is income a direct measure of how much each person should contribute to non-monetary aspects of the household?\n\nI remember that in many relationships, the division of labor isn't necessarily proportional to income. It's more about how both partners feel they can contribute given their time and circumstances. If the wife is working, even if less than the husband, she might be just as busy with her job and not have the time or energy to do more chores. Plus, childcare and housework are demanding and don't necessarily get divided based on income.\n\nThe husband's reasoning might be based on the idea that since he's funding most of the household, he's entitled to more \"free\" labor in the form of chores. But that could be seen as unfair because financial contribution doesn't automatically equate to a right over how others contribute. It's possible that the wife is already contributing in other ways, maybe emotionally or through her job, which isn't being recognized.\n\nAlso, the husband is framing it as a matter of fairness, but if the wife is working, even part-time, she might be juggling both work and home, which can be a lot. The husband's argument might overlook her contributions and the fact that housework and childcare are not just physical tasks but also time-consuming and mentally taxing.\n\nAnother angle is that the husband is implying that without his income, they couldn't survive, which might not be entirely true. They both work together to sustain the household, even if he's earning more. The wife's job might provide other benefits like healthcare or flexibility that aren't quantified in salary. Plus, if she were to leave her job, it might not be feasible for her to come back, which is a consideration in the long-term.\n\nMoreover, expecting the wife to take on more chores because he's the higher earner can lead to resentment. Relationships thrive on mutual respect and understanding, not just transactional exchanges. The husband might need to recognize that his wife's contributions are valuable in their own right, even if they aren't monetary.\n\nSo, putting this all together, I think the husband is in the wrong because he's using his higher income as a justification to shift more domestic responsibilities onto his wife without considering her own workload or the emotional and physical toll of childcare and housework. It's important to have open communication and find a balance that works for both partners, rather than basing contributions solely on financial input.\n"
