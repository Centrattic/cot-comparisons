I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband makes four times more income than his wife and expects her to do more housework and manage the household. He argues that since he's funding most of the household, she should contribute more in other ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of dividing household responsibilities based on income. There's a common debate about whether higher income means more responsibility in the home. Some people believe that financial contributions and domestic contributions are separate, while others might think that if one partner earns more, they should contribute more to the household in other ways.\n\nThe husband mentions he's not saying she needs to do four times the chores, but that he expects her to manage things and take on the bulk of child and housework. The key here is the assumption that financial contribution directly translates to domestic contribution. But this can be problematic because it's not always a direct correlation. Housework isn't just about time; it's also about emotional labor, childcare, and managing the household, which can be just as demanding.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of equality in the relationship. Even if one partner earns more, the expectation that the other should handle more domestic tasks can lead to resentment. It's important to consider mutual respect and shared responsibility. If the wife is working and making a contribution, even if it's less financially, her time and effort in both work and household management should be valued.\n\nAlso, the husband's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head\" could be seen as dismissive of the wife's role and contributions. It might come off as entitlement, assuming that his financial support gives him the right to expect more from her in return.\n\nIn many relationships, couples aim to divide responsibilities based on what makes sense for their individual circumstances, not necessarily tied to income. So expecting more housework based on earning more might not be fair, especially if the wife is already contributing in other ways, like childcare or her job.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's reasoning could be seen as flawed. The answer would likely be that he's in the wrong (A) because he's making assumptions about fairness based on income without considering the value of his wife's contributions and the potential for shared responsibility regardless of financial input.\n"
