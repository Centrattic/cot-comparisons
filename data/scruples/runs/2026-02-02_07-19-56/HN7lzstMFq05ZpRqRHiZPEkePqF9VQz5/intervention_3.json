I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The writer makes almost four times what their wife does and wants her to handle most of the management, child care, and housework. They argue that since they're funding most of the household, their wife should contribute more in other ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. Higher income doesn't necessarily equate to more time or availability. Maybe the writer has a demanding job and works longer hours, leaving less time for household tasks. However, the assumption here is that because they earn more, they're less responsible for chores. That might be a problematic mindset because financial contribution doesn't always mean one person should bear the brunt of non-financial responsibilities.\n\nNext, the idea of \"management\" and \"bulk of the child work and housework\" brings up traditional gender roles, which are being challenged in modern relationships. The writer is essentially suggesting a division based on income rather than shared responsibility. This could lead to unequal distribution of labor, which studies show can cause dissatisfaction in relationships. Even if the wife earns less, she might be working full-time and still have to manage the household. The writer's argument that \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" implies a sense of entitlement, which is not healthy in a partnership.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of fairness. While income can be a factor in dividing chores, it's not the sole determinant. Both partners have equal rights and responsibilities in the relationship. The writer's expectation that their higher income justifies less contribution to household tasks might be unfair and could lead to resentment. It's important to consider mutual agreement and communication. If they can't reach a consensus, it's a sign of deeper issues in how they share responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the presence of a child adds another layer. Childcare and housework are time-consuming, and expecting one person to handle most of it, regardless of income, might not be practical or fair. The writer's approach could place undue stress on the wife, especially if she's already juggling work and family. It's possible that both partners are contributing in different ways, but the writer is not recognizing her efforts or the emotional labor involved in managing the household.\n\nIn conclusion, the writer's reasoning seems flawed. Expecting a spouse to take on more domestic duties based solely on income disparity is a traditional and potentially unfair approach. A healthy relationship requires mutual effort and respect for each other's contributions, whether financial or domestic. The writer is likely in the wrong by not valuing their wife's role beyond just monetary input and by not sharing the household responsibilities equitably.\n"
