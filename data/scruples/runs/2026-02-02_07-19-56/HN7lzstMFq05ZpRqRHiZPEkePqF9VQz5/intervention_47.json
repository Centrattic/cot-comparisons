I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expecting their wife to do more housework and childcare because they earn four times more.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author makes significantly more money and believes that since they're the primary income, the wife should handle more domestic responsibilities. They mention that they fund \"almost the whole operation\" and think the wife should contribute more in other areas like managing the household and childcare.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. Traditionally, higher-earning partners might expect the other to handle more domestic tasks, but this can be a sensitive issue. The question is whether this expectation is fair or if it places an unfair burden on the wife. \n\nI should consider factors like mutual agreement, communication, and fairness. The author's argument is based on their financial contribution, but relationships often require a balance of contributions beyond just money. Emotional labor, childcare, and household management are also significant. If the wife is handling a large part of the childcare and housework already, expecting her to take even more might be unreasonable, especially if she's working part-time, which might be the case here since her income is much lower.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that because someone earns more, they deserve less domestic work. This can perpetuate gender stereotypes where women are expected to do more housework even when they earn less. The author might be reinforcing these stereotypes. \n\nHowever, some might argue that if one partner is contributing more financially, it's fair for the other to take on more domestic responsibilities. But the key here is whether the expectation is communicated and agreed upon by both partners. If the wife feels overburdened or the division is unequal, it's a problem regardless of income.\n\nThe author's use of \"AITA\" suggests they're questioning their own rightness, which is common in these scenarios. The answer likely depends on whether there's a mutual understanding and if the division of labor is fair to both parties. If the wife is unhappy or the workload is unbalanced despite the financial contribution, the author might be in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's expectation could be seen as unjust if it's based on unequal power dynamics or traditional roles without mutual consent. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
