I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who earns four times more than his wife and expects her to do more housework and childcare because he's funding most of the household. He thinks he's not an asshole for that expectation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. The husband brings in more income, but that doesn't automatically mean he's not responsible for household duties. Traditional gender roles often assign more domestic work to women, but that's changing. The question is whether income should determine division of labor.\n\nFinancial contribution is one aspect, but both partners have a responsibility to maintain the household. The husband's argument that his higher income means the wife should do more chores might be based on the idea that he's \"paying for\" the house, so she should handle the upkeep. However, this can be seen as unfair because both are living in the same home and raising the same child. The child's needs aren't just about money; emotional and physical care are involved too.\n\nAlso, the husband's statement that without him, they couldn't afford things implies a dependency that might not be accurate. They're a team, and partnership in tasks should be mutual. The fact that they've been married four years and this is a constant disagreement suggests it's a recurring issue that affects their relationship.\n\nThe wife's contribution to the household isn't just about income. She's working too, even if less. The husband's expectation might be stemming from outdated assumptions about gender roles rather than a fair assessment of contributions. \n\nMoreover, the idea that management of the household should fall on one person because of income seems flawed. Management tasks like keeping track of schedules, bills, etc., are part of a shared responsibility. Assuming one person should handle all of that without input from the other can lead to resentment.\n\nIn modern relationships, fairness is often about communication and mutual agreement, not about who earns more. The husband's approach might be leading to imbalance and could be seen as putting the wife in a position that's more akin to a traditional housewife role, which might not align with her current role as a working parent.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might be in the wrong because he's using his income as a justification to shift more domestic responsibilities onto his wife, which can perpetuate unequal gender roles and create an unfair division of labor. The right approach would be for both to share responsibilities based on their capacity and preferences, not just income.\n"
