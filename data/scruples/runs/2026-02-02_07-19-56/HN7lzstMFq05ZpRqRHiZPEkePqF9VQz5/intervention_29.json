I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The writer is saying that since they earn four times more than their wife, they expect her to handle more housework and childcare. They also mention that they fund most of the household expenses and feel that their wife should contribute more in other ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of dividing household responsibilities based on income. While it's true that higher income might mean the person can afford to hire help, the question is whether expecting a spouse to do more chores based on the other's income is fair. \n\nIn many households, the division of labor isn't strictly tied to income. Factors like personal strengths, time availability, and preferences also play a role. For example, if one partner works long hours, the other might take on more domestic duties even if their income is lower. However, the key here is the expectation that the higher earner's financial contribution justifies the spouse doing more chores. \n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual respect and partnership. A healthy relationship often involves shared responsibilities, not just divided based on financial contributions. Expecting the spouse to \"manage\" everything might place an undue burden on her, especially if she's already handling childcare. \n\nAdditionally, the writer's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head\" comes off as dismissive of their wife's contributions. It assumes that financial support is the only valuable contribution, which isn't the case. Emotional support, parenting, and other non-monetary contributions are equally important.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if one partner is funding most of the household, it's reasonable to expect them to have less time for chores. But this line of reasoning can lead to gender stereotypes if not carefully considered. The writer's expectation that the wife should handle \"management\" and the bulk of chores could reinforce traditional gender roles, which might be unfair regardless of income.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationship. Constant disagreement about chores can create resentment. It's important for both partners to communicate and find a balance that works for them, rather than imposing expectations based on income alone.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer's financial contribution is significant, expecting their wife to do more housework solely based on that might not be fair. Household responsibilities should ideally be divided based on what's feasible for both partners, considering their individual circumstances and not just income. The writer's approach could be seen as putting pressure on their wife without acknowledging her own contributions, which could make them at fault here.\n"
