      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who earns four times more than his wife and expects her to take on more household responsibilities and childcare. He's asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for expecting that. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author makes almost four times what his wife does. He's not saying she has to do four times the chores, but he expects her to manage the household and take on the bulk of the childcare and housework. His reasoning is that since he's funding most of the expenses, she should contribute more in other areas.\n\nNow, considering traditional gender roles, it's often been the case that the higher-earning spouse (usually the man) is seen as the primary breadwinner, while the other handles more domestic duties. However, societal norms are shifting, and many people now advocate for more equal sharing of responsibilities regardless of income. \n\nThe author's argument is that since he's contributing more financially, he's entitled to less domestic work. But this line of thinking can be problematic. Income doesn't necessarily dictate responsibility distribution in a modern, equal partnership. Many couples share chores based on availability, skills, or mutual agreement rather than income. \n\nAlso, the idea that the wife should manage everything because the husband is the main earner might stem from outdated notions of gender roles. It could be seen as unfair if the wife is working and still expected to handle most of the household management. The key issue here is whether the division of labor is fair and agreed upon by both partners, not just based on income.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that because he's funding the household, he's \"doing more.\" But financial contribution is just one aspect of contributing to a household. Emotional labor, childcare, and daily chores are also significant. If the wife is working, she might be as or more busy, so expecting her to take on more without considering her workload could be unfair.\n\nThe author might be missing the fact that his wife's income, even if less, is still a contribution. The question is whether there's a fair balance. If the wife is working and managing the household, she's contributing in multiple ways. The author's demand for her to do more could be seen as taking advantage of her labor without recognizing her work.\n\nHowever, some might argue that if both partners agree on a division of labor where one handles finances and the other handles domestic tasks, that's okay. But the problem arises if one partner feels coerced or if it's based on unequal expectations. The author's statement that \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" implies a sense of ownership over the household, which can be toxic in a partnership.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's important to consider mutual respect and communication. If this is a constant disagreement, it suggests that there's no effective communication or compromise happening. The author should be considering how his wife feels about the current arrangement and whether they can find a more balanced approach that respects both their contributions, regardless of income.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's expectation that his wife should do more because he earns more is likely based on outdated or unequal assumptions. The answer is probably that he's in the wrong because contributing to the household shouldn't be measured solely by income and should be a mutual agreement rather than an entitlement based on earnings.\n"
