I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework and childcare because they earn more than her. The question is whether they are an asshole (AITA), and the options are A or B.\n\nFirst, the core issue here is the expectation of equitable contribution to household responsibilities based on income. The author makes almost four times what his wife does and believes she should handle more chores and child-related tasks. He argues that since he's the primary breadwinner, she should contribute more in other areas. \n\nNow, I need to consider societal norms and fairness. Traditionally, higher earners might have expected their partners to manage the home, but modern views often emphasize equality and shared responsibilities regardless of income. The question is whether expecting more contribution based on income is fair. \n\nSome might argue that household duties should be split based on time and energy available, not income. Even if one earns more, both partners are investing time into the relationship, and expecting the lower-earning spouse to take more tasks could be seen as unfair. Additionally, childcare and housework are often seen as joint responsibilities, not something to be traded for financial support.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning is that he's funding the family, so she should compensate in other ways. But this assumes that financial contribution is the only form of contribution, which isn't necessarily true. Also, the wife's work, even if lower-paying, still contributes to the household. It's possible that the author is undervaluing her contributions. \n\nThere's also the dynamic of how they negotiated their roles. If they didn't have an agreement on household responsibilities, the author imposing expectations based on income might be problematic. Communication is key here. The fact that it's a constant disagreement suggests that their current arrangement isn't working for both parties.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, expecting someone to take on more just because the other earns more could be seen as traditional gender roles, which many people now reject. Modern relationships often aim for a more balanced approach where both partners share responsibilities as per their abilities and time, not necessarily income.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that if one person's job is more demanding or time-consuming, they might have less capacity for housework. But the author is the higher earner, so maybe he has less time. However, the question isn't about time but about expecting more from the lower earner because of financial contribution.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's reasoning might be seen as outdated or unfair. It could be that he's not considering the value of his wife's contributions beyond income and is placing unequal expectations based on financial support. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
