      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user, a husband, is asking if he's an asshole (AITA) for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns four times more than she does. They have a child, and this is a constant disagreement. He mentions that he's not asking her to do four times the chores, but rather to take on the \"management\" role, handling the bulk of childcare and housework. His reasoning is that since he's the main financial provider, she should contribute more in other areas. The core of the question is whether his expectation is fair or if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their situation. The husband makes significantly more money, which might lead him to feel he's the primary provider. However, financial contribution doesn't necessarily dictate household responsibilities. In many relationships, both partners contribute in different ways, not just monetarily. Emotional labor, childcare, and housework are all valid contributions. \n\nThe key here is the assumption that higher income equates to less responsibility in other areas. That's a traditional gender role that many modern relationships challenge. The husband might be expecting his wife to take on more because of his income, but that could be placing an unfair burden on her, especially if she's working and managing a child. \n\nAlso, the idea that management duties (tracking tasks, organizing) should fall on the wife might be a relic of outdated expectations. Shared responsibility is often more balanced. If the husband is expecting her to handle all the management and childcare without considering her input or her own work, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The couple has had this disagreement for four years, which suggests it's a recurring issue. Maybe they haven't discussed their expectations clearly or reached a mutual agreement. The husband's framing implies that his financial contribution justifies more work from her, but this might not account for her contributions, both paid and unpaid. \n\nIt's also important to note that the husband is funding \"almost the whole operation,\" but that doesn't mean his wife isn't contributing in other ways. Her role in childcare and housework is valuable, and expecting her to do more without considering her capacity could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of fairness, many would argue that household responsibilities should be divided based on each person's capacity and preferences, not just income. Assuming that because he earns more, she should do more might be an example of traditional gender roles that don't consider equality in modern relationships. \n\nSo putting it all together, the husband's reasoning might be based on outdated notions of gender roles rather than a fair assessment of their shared responsibilities. Therefore, the answer is likely that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
