I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. The author argues that since he makes four times her income, she should handle more chores and childcare. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key point is whether financial contribution should dictate the division of household labor. The author is equating income with responsibility, suggesting that because he's the primary earner, his wife should take on more domestic duties. But this is a common debate point.\n\nFrom a modern perspective, many people advocate for an equal division of labor regardless of income. The idea is that both partners are contributing to the household in different ways. The author's argument could be seen as reinforcing traditional gender roles where the higher-earning partner is the head of the household, and the other is expected to manage domestic tasks. However, this might not account for the wife's contributions, such as emotional labor or other forms of work that aren't as visible but are essential.\n\nThe user's example mentions that the wife isn't doing 4x the chores but that the author expects her to manage everything and do the bulk. This might be an unfair assumption. Even if one partner earns more, the expectation that they should bear a significant portion of household responsibilities could be problematic. It might lead to resentment if the wife feels overwhelmed or unappreciated.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of fairness versus equality. Maybe the author is focusing on fairness based on financial contribution, but fairness can also mean considering each person's capacity and willingness to take on tasks. If the wife is working a demanding job too, her ability to handle housework might be limited. The author's approach might not be considering her workload or the non-monetary contributions she's making.\n\nAlso, the statement \"if not for me, she couldn't keep the roof...\" could be seen as minimizing the wife's role in the household. It implies that her contributions are less valuable compared to his financial support, which might be a form of emotional manipulation or lack of recognition.\n\nIn modern relationships, many couples aim for a balance where responsibilities are shared according to what each person can manage, not necessarily their income. The author's expectation might be based on outdated norms and could lead to an imbalance in the partnership. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not recognizing the value of equal contributions and for imposing a traditional role on his wife based on income disparity.\n"
