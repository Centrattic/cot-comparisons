I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. The author makes almost four times what his wife does and thinks she should manage the household and take on more child and housework. He's framing it as not necessarily a 4x ratio, but more about the fact that since he's funding most of the expenses, she should contribute more in other areas.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations around domestic responsibilities. Traditionally, there's been an idea that whoever earns more should take on more financial responsibility, but the opposite for household chores might not be as clear. However, modern discussions often emphasize equality regardless of income. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's expectations are fair. If he's not doing any housework because he's working more, that could be an issue. But the question is about the expectation based on his higher income. The user might be conflating financial contribution with domestic contribution. Just because he's contributing more financially doesn't automatically mean he's entitled to less domestic work. In many relationships, the expectation is that both partners contribute in ways that suit their circumstances, not necessarily based on income.\n\nAlso, the author mentions \"management\" and tracking things. That's a specific role, but it's still part of the household responsibilities. If both partners are supposed to share these tasks, then expecting one to do it all might be unfair. Additionally, the child care aspect is important. Parenting responsibilities often require shared effort, and expecting one parent to handle the bulk could be seen as unequal, especially if the other is working more. However, some parents might adjust based on work schedules. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The author might be feeling resentful because he's covering most of the finances and expects reciprocation in domestic duties. But fairness in relationships isn't always about a transactional exchange. It's more about mutual respect and understanding each other's capacities. Maybe the wife's job requires her to work, but she's also contributing in other ways. The author's insistence on her taking on more might not consider her workload or preferences.\n\nI should also think about gender roles. The question doesn't specify the genders of the partners, but assuming it's a traditional setup, there might be underlying biases. However, the question is about the fairness based on income, not gender. \n\nIn summary, the author's reasoning that higher income entitles him to less domestic work is problematic. Household responsibilities are typically shared based on what each partner can contribute, not necessarily their income. The assumption that financial contribution justifies less domestic work is likely where the author is in the wrong. Relationships require communication and mutual agreement on roles, not unilateral expectations based on income. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
