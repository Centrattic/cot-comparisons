I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn significantly more money.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author makes almost four times what the wife does and expects her to handle more household responsibilities and childcare. They argue that since they're funding most of the household, the wife should contribute more in other areas. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nHmm. The question really boils down to whether financial contribution justifies expecting more domestic labor. I know that in many relationships, the division of household chores isn't directly tied to income. People often split tasks based on skills, preferences, or time availability, not necessarily income. But the author is using their higher income as a reason for the wife to take on more, which might be problematic because it implies that money equals responsibility in chores, which isn't a standard approach.\n\nAlso, childcare is a shared responsibility in many modern families. If the author isn't contributing enough, it could be a problem. Just because they earn more doesn't mean they have less time or capacity to help. Maybe they could be working part-time, but that's not stated here. The author's argument that the wife should manage everything because of their income could come off as entitled. It's important to consider mutual respect and teamwork in a relationship. Expecting someone to do more because of your income might not be fair, and it's possible that the author is not taking into account the wife's contributions beyond just financial aspects. The wife might have her own reasons for earning less, like taking time off for the child, which the author isn't acknowledging. So, the author might be in the wrong for making the assumption that higher income equates to others doing more chores. They should consider a more balanced approach regardless of income disparities.\n"
