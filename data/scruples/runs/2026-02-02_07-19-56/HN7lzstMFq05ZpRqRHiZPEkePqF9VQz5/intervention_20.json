I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author expects his wife to do more housework because he earns four times more than she does. He's asking if it's unfair to expect her to handle more responsibilities since he's the primary breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common perspectives on this. Some people might argue that traditional gender roles suggest the wife should handle domestic tasks, but modern views often emphasize equality in chores regardless of income. The author is assuming that higher income justifies more domestic responsibility from the other partner, which could be seen as old-fashioned or even exploitative. \n\nThe key point is whether income should determine the division of labor. Studies and societal trends increasingly support shared responsibilities. Even if one partner earns more, it doesn't necessarily mean they should do less at home. The author's reasoning might be based on the idea that financial contribution equals less need for domestic work, but that's not universally accepted. It might also place undue pressure on the wife, especially if she has other responsibilities like caring for a child.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentions it's a constant disagreement, which suggests that expectations aren't aligned. Both partners should discuss and agree on a fair division of tasks that works for them. Assuming that his higher income automatically means she should do more chores without considering her input could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the author seems to imply that his wife's contribution is less valuable, which might not be fair. Childcare and household management are significant and time-consuming tasks. Valuing these contributions equally is important for a balanced partnership.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, some societies still uphold traditional roles, but many others are moving towards egalitarian models. The answer might depend on the couple's specific circumstances and agreement. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. By expecting more from his wife based solely on income, he might be perpetuating an unequal dynamic, which could make him the asshole in the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because his assumption that higher income justifies less domestic contribution from his wife is an outdated and potentially unfair view. The answer should be A.\n"
