I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband makes four times as much as his wife. He's saying she should manage the household and do most of the chores and childcare. His reasoning is that since he's providing most of the income, she should handle the other responsibilities. But wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI remember that in relationships, splitting responsibilities isn't always about income. Even if one partner earns more, both should share household duties. The idea that one's higher income justifies the other doing more chores might be outdated or unfair. It could be seen as assuming the higher earner is less responsible, which isn't necessarily the case. Plus, childcare and housework aren't just tasks; they're important for the family's well-being. Expecting the lower-earning spouse to take on more because the higher earner \"funds the operation\" might be putting pressure on them and not considering their own workload.\n\nAlso, the husband is asking if he's an asshole for expecting this. He's not accounting for his wife's contributions beyond just the financial aspect. Maybe she has her own job, which is part-time or lower-paying, but still requires her attention. The assumption that she should manage everything because he's the main provider could be dismissive of her efforts and create an imbalance. \n\nMoreover, the dynamic where one person is the \"manager\" of the household might not be equitable unless both agree to it. There's also the aspect of mutual respect and shared responsibilities. Even if he's earning more, it doesn't automatically mean he shouldn't contribute to chores. Both partners should have a say in how tasks are divided. \n\nAnother angle is that this expectation might be rooted in traditional gender roles, which are being challenged in modern relationships. It's important to consider that both partners have their own needs and capacities. Maybe the wife is already doing a lot, and the husband isn't recognizing her efforts. The key is communication and finding a balance that works for both, rather than using income as a justification for unequal distribution of labor.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the husband is contributing more financially, expecting his wife to take on the majority of domestic and childcare responsibilities based on his income could be seen as unfair. Relationships should ideally involve shared responsibilities regardless of income disparity. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering an equitable split of tasks that accounts for both partners' circumstances and contributions beyond just financial aspects.\n"
