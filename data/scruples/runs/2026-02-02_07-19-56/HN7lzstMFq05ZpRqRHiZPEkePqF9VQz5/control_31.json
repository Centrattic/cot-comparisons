I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework since they earn four times more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their situation. They have a child, so childcare and housework are significant. The husband makes four times more income. He's suggesting that because he contributes more financially, the wife should handle more household responsibilities. \n\nBut here's the thing: traditional gender roles often assign more domestic duties to the lower-earning partner, but modern relationships might approach this differently. The key point is whether expecting the wife to do more housework based on income is fair. \n\nEarnings can affect financial contributions, but that doesn't necessarily translate to a proportional division of labor. Many people argue that domestic responsibilities should be shared equally regardless of income. The husband's argument is that he's funding most of the household, so the wife should compensate by handling chores and childcare. However, this might overlook the fact that both partners have different needs and circumstances. For example, if the wife works part-time to manage the home, or if both have demanding jobs, the balance could be different.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional labor involved in managing the household. If the wife is already handling that, adding more might be unfair. The husband's expectation that she's the \"management\" might mean she's taking on more mental tasks, which can be just as exhausting as physical labor. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"If not for me\" implies a lack of recognition that the wife's contributions are valuable. It's possible that the husband isn't acknowledging her efforts, which could lead to resentment. \n\nIn terms of fairness, relationships often require mutual understanding and communication. The husband's expectation may not consider the wife's perspective or the actual distribution of tasks. If this is a constant disagreement, it suggests that neither side is compromising, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, putting it all together, expecting the wife to do more because of higher income isn't inherently wrong, but it's problematic if it's leading to an unequal or unspoken division of labor without considering each other's contributions. The husband might be in the wrong if he's not recognizing the value of the wife's work and if the expectations are causing conflict without collaborative problem-solving. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
