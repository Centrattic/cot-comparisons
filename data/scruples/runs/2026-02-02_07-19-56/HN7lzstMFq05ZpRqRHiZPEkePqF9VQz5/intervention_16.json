I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework and childcare because he earns four times more. The author argues that since he's funding most of the household, his wife should handle the management and bulk of the chores.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of household responsibilities and financial contributions. There's a common belief that higher income equals more responsibility in other areas, but I think it's not that straightforward. Just because someone earns more doesn't necessarily mean they should do less around the house. Relationships are about partnership, and expectations can vary based on mutual agreement and personal values.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since he's the main financial provider, his wife should compensate with domestic work. However, this seems to assume a traditional gender role where men earn and women manage the home. But in modern relationships, many couples aim for a more equal distribution of both financial and domestic responsibilities. Also, the author's argument might overlook the fact that his wife's job contributes to the household income, even if it's less, and that her time and effort in child-rearing and housework have economic value.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationship. Constant disagreements about chores can lead to resentment. The key might be communication and finding a balance that both feel is fair. The author's approach of expecting more from his wife without considering her perspective could be part of the problem. It's important to recognize that both partners' contributions are vital, even if they differ in type or amount.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions the child's needs, which is valid, but childcare is a shared responsibility. If one parent is doing the majority, it can create an imbalance. Studies show that shared parenting leads to better outcomes for children and the parents' well-being. The author's stance might not account for the emotional labor involved in managing the household, which can be just as demanding as paid work.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because he's imposing his expectations without considering mutual agreement and the value of his wife's contributions. It's not just about who earns more but how both partners feel their efforts are valued and balanced.\n"
