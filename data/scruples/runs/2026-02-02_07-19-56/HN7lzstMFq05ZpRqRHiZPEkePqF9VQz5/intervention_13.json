I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn significantly more. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The author believes that since they contribute more financially, their wife should take on more domestic responsibilities. On the surface, this might seem like a fair trade-off, but there's a lot more to consider.\n\nDomestic responsibilities aren't just about money. They involve time, emotional labor, and physical effort. Even if the husband is the primary breadwinner, the division of labor at home isn't necessarily proportional to income. Many couples find balance in different ways, and expecting someone to manage everything just because you earn more can be seen as shifting the burden unfairly.\n\nAlso, the idea that one person's contribution is more valuable than the other's is a common point of contention. While financial support is crucial, managing the household, childcare, and other non-monetary contributions are equally vital. The author's argument assumes that their financial input justifies a lesser share of domestic duties, which could be dismissive of their wife's efforts and the value of her work.\n\nAnother angle is societal expectations and gender roles. Historically, women have shouldered more household responsibilities, but modern relationships often aim for equality. The author's stance might perpetuate outdated norms, even if unintentionally. The question is whether the expectation here is based on mutual agreement or unspoken assumptions rooted in traditional roles.\n\nAdditionally, the author's phrasing, like \"if not for me, she couldn't...\" might come across as condescending. It implies that the wife's contributions are less essential, which can undermine partnership dynamics. Healthy relationships require teamwork and mutual respect, not a transactional view of contributions.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that if both parties agree to this arrangement, it might not be a problem. But the scenario mentions this is a constant disagreement, indicating that the wife is unhappy with the current division. In that case, the author's expectations are likely exacerbating the conflict.\n\nIn AITA contexts, the key is whether the actions or expectations are unreasonable or harmful. The author's reasoning might not be malicious, but it's still problematic because it doesn't account for the wife's perspective or the imbalance in their current situation. The fact that this is a recurring issue suggests that the approach isn't working for both sides, which points to the author being in the wrong.\n"
