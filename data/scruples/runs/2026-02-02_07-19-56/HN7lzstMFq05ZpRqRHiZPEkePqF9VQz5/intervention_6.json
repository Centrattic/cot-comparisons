I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework?

AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about expecting the wife to do more housework because he makes four times her income.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author argues that since he earns more, the wife should handle more of the housework and childcare. He mentions he's not expecting her to do four times the chores, just to manage things and take on the bulk. He feels he's funding the family, so she should contribute more in other areas.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and equality in relationships, the traditional view might suggest that the higher-earning spouse expects the other to handle household duties. However, modern perspectives often emphasize shared responsibility regardless of income. The key here is whether it's fair to assign more domestic work based on earning potential.\n\nThe wife's contribution to housework and childcare is significant, especially with a child. Even though the husband is the primary earner, household responsibilities aren't solely about money. Emotional labor, like managing schedules and keeping track of things, is also part of the equation. If the wife is doing most of that, it's a valid point, but if the husband is expecting her to do more without considering her workload or her contributions, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the wife's income is less important. But in many relationships, both partners contribute financially, even if one earns more. The husband's argument that he's funding the family is partially true, but it's a team effort. Plus, the wife's role in raising the child is a shared responsibility, not just hers.\n\nThe line \"If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over...\" is a bit paternalistic. It implies that without his income, the family would struggle, which can undermine the wife's role and contributions. It's possible he's not acknowledging her efforts in childcare and managing the home, which are crucial even if they don't come with a salary.\n\nOn the other hand, splitting household chores isn't always about splitting them 50-50. Different people have different capacities and strengths. Maybe the wife is better at managing things, but that doesn't mean it's fair to assign her all the responsibility, especially if she's also working.\n\nThe question is whether expecting her to do more because he's the higher earner is fair. Many argue that domestic responsibilities should be divided equitably, not based on income. The husband's argument could be seen as placing a disproportionate burden on his wife, expecting her to handle more because he's the one bringing in more money. That could lead to resentment and imbalance in the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's expectation might be based on traditional gender roles rather than fairness. The wife's contributions to the home, especially with a child, are substantial. The husband should consider the actual division of labor and mutual agreement rather than income as the deciding factor. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
