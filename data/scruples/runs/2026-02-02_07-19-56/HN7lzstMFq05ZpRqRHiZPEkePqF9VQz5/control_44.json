I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for expecting their wife to handle more housework and childcare since they earn four times as much. The question is pretty straightforward, but I need to consider the nuances here.\n\nFirst, the core issue is the division of household labor and childcare based on income. The author argues that because they contribute more financially, their wife should take on more domestic responsibilities. That seems like a common belief, but I should think about whether it's justifiable.\n\nIn many relationships, people have different understandings of what fair contribution means. Some might believe that the person with higher income should take on more financial responsibilities, while the other handles the household. However, others might argue that both partners should share domestic duties equally, regardless of income. The key here is the expectation of \"management\" and the bulk of the work.\n\nThe author mentions that their wife isn't doing 4x the chores but should contribute more. But expecting the higher earner to do less housework is a point of contention. Studies have shown that higher-earning individuals sometimes end up doing less housework because they or their partners may assume they should focus on their careers. But that can lead to imbalance and resentment.\n\nThe phrase \"If not for me, she couldn't...\" might come across as dismissive of her role and contributions. It's important to recognize that each person's contributions to the household are valuable, even if they aren't monetary. The wife might be working, managing other aspects of the home, or taking care of emotional labor that isn't visible.\n\nAlso, the question of whether the author is an asshole depends on the overall context. If there's a consistent pattern of the wife handling more tasks without acknowledgment or support, it could be seen as unfair. The author should consider communication and mutual agreement on responsibilities rather than unilaterally dictating based on income.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a legal or absolute sense, the expectation is based on a potentially outdated or unfair assumption that financial contribution should dictate domestic labor. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, they are in the wrong) because the approach is flawed and could be harming the relationship's balance.\n"
