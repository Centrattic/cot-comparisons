I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn more. The author argues that since they contribute more financially, the wife should take on more domestic responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and gender roles. Traditionally, higher earners might expect more domestic help, but modern views often emphasize equality regardless of income. However, the situation isn't just about equality; it's about contribution. The author is making a case based on their financial contribution.\n\nNext, the key point is whether the author's expectation is fair. The user mentions that their wife takes on \"management\" and child work. The author is asking if expecting her to do the \"bulk\" is unreasonable. The financial contribution is significant, but does that translate to a proportional share of household duties?\n\nI should also consider communication. The fact that it's a \"constant disagreement\" suggests that the expectations aren't aligned. Maybe the author hasn't discussed this openly with their spouse, leading to resentment. The wife might feel that her current contributions are already substantial, especially with a child involved.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of contribution beyond income. Childcare and household management are significant responsibilities. The author might be underestimating the value of their wife's work, which is time-intensive and often unpaid. Assigning tasks based on income could lead to imbalance, as financial contributions don't directly translate to physical or emotional labor.\n\nAlso, the author's statement \"If not for me, she couldn't...\" implies a sense of entitlement, which might be problematic. It could be seen as dismissing the wife's role in maintaining the home and child. Mutual respect and shared responsibilities are crucial in partnerships.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has a right to expect help, the assumption that more income justifies more domestic work from the spouse might be the issue. Equality and mutual agreement should guide the division of labor, rather than income disparity. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong, as the expectation isn't based on mutual understanding but on financial contribution.\n"
