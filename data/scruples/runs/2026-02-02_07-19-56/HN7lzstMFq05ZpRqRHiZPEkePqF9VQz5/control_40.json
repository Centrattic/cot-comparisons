I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to do more housework because he earns more. Hmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms and expectations around domestic responsibilities. In many societies, there's a traditional view that the higher-earning spouse might have a different division of labor, but that's changing.\n\nThe author argues that since he makes 4 times more, he's funding most of the household, so his wife should handle more chores. But does income directly translate to household responsibilities? Some might say that fairness isn't about splitting chores based on income but on mutual agreement and shared goals. Also, having a child adds to the workload, and both parents might need to adjust their roles.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's contribution isn't just monetary. Emotional labor, childcare, and managing the household are significant. If the author is expecting her to manage everything because he's the main earner, he might be overlooking her existing contributions. Plus, expecting her to be the \"manager\" could add stress without considering her capacity or willingness.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. If this is a constant disagreement, maybe both need to talk about their expectations rather than assuming the other should adjust. The key point is whether expecting her to take on more is fair, considering their specific situation and any prior agreements. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's imposing his expectations without considering mutual agreement and the value of non-monetary contributions.\n"
