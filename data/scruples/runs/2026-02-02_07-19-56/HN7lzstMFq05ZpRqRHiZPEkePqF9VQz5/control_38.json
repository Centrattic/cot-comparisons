I make almost 4x what she does. I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework? If not for me, she couldn't keep the roof over our child's head or food in his mouth. I am funding almost the whole operation, so I believe she should be contributing in other ways. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their wife to do more housework because they earn four times more. Hmm. So the author makes almost four times the wife's income and wants her to handle more chores and child responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider traditional roles versus modern views. In the past, it was common for the higher-earning spouse to work outside the home while the other managed the house. But these days, many couples share responsibilities equally regardless of income. The author is arguing that since they fund most of the household, the wife should contribute more in other areas. But does that make sense?\n\nI should think about the assumption that higher income equals less responsibility for chores. Just because someone earns more doesn't necessarily mean they should do less around the house. In fact, many people believe in equal sharing of domestic duties regardless of income. The author might be placing an unfair burden on the wife by linking financial contribution directly to household work. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the wife isn't doing \"4x the chores,\" but wants her to take on management and child work. Management could be subjective. Maybe the author expects the wife to organize everything, but if they're both working, that might not be feasible. The key point is whether the expectations are reasonable and communicated clearly. \n\nAnother angle: the author's reasoning that without their income, they can't support the family. That might be a bit self-centered. Financial contribution is part of the equation, but emotional labor and childcare are also significant. Splitting these tasks fairly is important for both partners' well-being. \n\nI should check if there's any cultural context, but the question doesn't specify. Assuming a Western context where shared responsibilities are the norm. The author's argument might stem from a traditional view, but modern relationships often value equality. \n\nSo, the answer likely is A, the author is in the wrong. They're imposing expectations based on income, which isn't the standard in many current relationships. Household chores and childcare are typically shared, not divided by income ratio. The author's approach could lead to resentment and imbalance. They should consider a more equitable division of labor, regardless of earnings.\n"
