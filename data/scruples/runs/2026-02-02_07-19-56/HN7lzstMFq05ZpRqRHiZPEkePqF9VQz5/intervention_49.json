I'm not saying she has to do 4x the chores, but am I an asshole for expecting her to at least be the \"management\" and keep track of everything, as well as being the one to take on the bulk of the child work and housework?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author expecting his wife to do more housework and childcare because he earns four times more than she does. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms around domestic responsibilities. In many cultures, there's a traditional view that the higher-earning spouse (often the man) should earn more while the other (often the woman) handles more of the home and child duties. But that's changing as more people advocate for equality in household roles regardless of income. The key question here is whether income should determine the division of labor at home.\n\nThe author argues that since he's contributing more financially, his wife should take on more of the non-financial responsibilities. However, this line of thinking can be problematic. It implies that financial contribution directly translates to less responsibility for other household tasks, which isn't a balanced approach. Housework and childcare are essential and shouldn't be seen as less valuable just because they don't involve monetary contributions.\n\nAnother angle is the mutual agreement and communication between the couple. The post mentions this is a constant disagreement, which suggests that they haven't found a compromise. The author's statement about not being able to keep the roof over their child's head or provide food without him is a bit self-centered. Marriage is a partnership, and both should work together, even if one earns more. It's important to recognize that both partners contribute in different ways, and their efforts should be valued equally.\n\nAlso, expecting the lower-earning spouse to manage everything and take on the bulk of domestic duties can lead to burnout and resentment. It's about fairness and mutual respect, not just splitting tasks based on income. Each person's capacity and willingness to take on certain roles should be considered. Maybe the wife has her own reasons for not doing more, like a demanding job or other constraints, which the author isn't considering.\n\nIn modern relationships, the trend is moving towards shared responsibilities regardless of income. So, the author's stance might be seen as outdated or unfair. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is indeed in the wrong by expecting unequal distribution of chores based solely on income.\n"
