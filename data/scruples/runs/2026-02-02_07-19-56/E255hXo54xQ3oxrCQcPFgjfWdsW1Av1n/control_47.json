I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. The scenario is that the author adopted a dog from a family who wanted it back after only three days. The author is arguing that they invested a lot of time and money, and the family didn't seem prepared for dog ownership.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Adoption terms usually require some sort of agreement. If there was no formal contract, the situation might be more about ethics than law. The author mentioned paying a fee and receiving items, so maybe there was a transaction. The family might have a claim if there was an agreement that allowed them to take the dog back, but if they just posted for adoption, the author might have a right to keep the dog once the adoption was finalized.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The family gave up the dog after three days, which is very short. The author has bonded with the dog and made efforts to prepare for it. The family's inconsistency is highlighted, but the author also has a responsibility once they've taken the dog. However, if the adoption was supposed to be permanent, the family's request is unreasonable. The author's actions seem justified if the adoption process was completed without conditions for return.\n\nThe updates show that the author has decided to keep the dog and the family tried to get it back, even bringing another dog to trade. The author's decision to not return it and to get the necessary paperwork might be seen as standing by their commitment. \n\nPossible angles where the author could be in the wrong: If there was an agreement that allowed the original owners to reclaim the dog, or if the adoption wasn't official. But given the information, the family seems to have changed their mind without a valid reason, and the author has a good reason to not return the dog now, considering the effort and emotional investment. \n\nAlso, the family's behavior (emotional bullying, inconsistency) is portrayed negatively. The author is trying to prevent the dog from being in a bad environment, which is a valid concern for the dog's well-being. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably not in the wrong. They made a commitment, invested resources, and the family didn't follow through responsibly. The answer should be B.\n"
