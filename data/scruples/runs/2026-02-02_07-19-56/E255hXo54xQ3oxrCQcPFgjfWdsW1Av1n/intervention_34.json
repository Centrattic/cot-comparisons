I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog. The situation is that the dog was given up for adoption after just three days by the family, and the author decided to keep it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, once a pet is adopted, the adoption is usually final unless there's a specific agreement in place. The author paid a fee and took possession of the dog, so legally they might have the right to keep it. The original owners might not have the legal standing to take the dog back unless there's a contract stating otherwise. However, the user is asking about moral wrong, not legal wrong, so that's a different angle.\n\nThe author mentions that the family wasn't prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for only three days and then decided to give it up. The author took the dog in, invested time, energy, and money into preparing for it. They've started bonding with the dog and have even trained it. The mom's emotional manipulation is also a factor, as she's trying to get the dog back for her daughter's emotional benefit.\n\nOn the other hand, the family might have felt they couldn't keep the dog, possibly due to unforeseen circumstances. The father's involvement and the mother's inconsistency are points the author is concerned about. The author is worried about the dog's future in that environment.\n\nMoral responsibility here is tricky. The family made a commitment by giving the dog up, but perhaps they changed their minds. The author, on the other hand, made a commitment by adopting the dog and has already bonded with it. The author is also trying to ensure the dog's well-being, which is a valid concern. The family's actions could lead to the dog being given to another family quickly, which might not be better.\n\nThe author's decision to keep the dog seems to be in the best interest of the dog's welfare, given the family's instability. However, some might argue that the original owners have a right to take the dog back if they're willing to care for it properly now. But the author has already started training and bonding, which the original owners didn't do in their three days.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions are more about providing a stable home for the dog, which is in the dog's best interest. The original family's inconsistency and the mother's manipulative behavior suggest they might not be the best caretakers. The author's refusal to trade the dog for another one also shows they're committed to their decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting in the dog's best interest and have provided a stable environment, while the original family's situation doesn't seem to support proper care. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
