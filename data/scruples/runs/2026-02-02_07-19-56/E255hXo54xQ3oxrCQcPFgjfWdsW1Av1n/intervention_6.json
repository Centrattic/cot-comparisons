I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about adopting a dog and then the original family wants it back. The user provided a detailed account from the person who adopted the dog, and the user themselves think the author might be wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The original family had the dog for three days before deciding to adopt it out. The adopter (the author) invested time, money, and effort into the adoption process\u2014like travel, time off work, and puppy-proofing their home. They also mention that the family doesn't seem prepared for dog ownership, especially the mom, who they think is inconsistent. The author decided to keep the dog despite the family's emotional appeals and later discovered the family got another dog from a breeder while trying to get their original dog back.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by not returning the dog. Legally, adoption agreements often require some form of contract. If there was a formal adoption process with an agreement, the author might be bound by it. However, the story suggests that the adoption was informal\u2014there's mention of a fee paid and some items exchanged, but no clear legal paperwork. The author kept the dog without returning it, which could be problematic if there's an agreement that was broken.\n\nEthically, the family changed their mind quickly, which is understandable but arguably irresponsible. The author points out that the family didn't prepare properly for dog ownership, and the dog was given up after just three days. The author has already bonded with the dog and invested resources. On the other hand, the family might have legal ownership if the adoption wasn't finalized properly. The author not returning the dog could be seen as taking advantage of the family's hasty decision.\n\nHowever, the family's behavior is also questionable. The mom's emotional manipulation and inconsistency in caring for the dog might have justified the author's decision. The family's actions\u2014like trying to get the dog back while getting a new one\u2014could reflect poorly on their responsibility as pet owners. The author's documentation and the meeting where the family offered a trade might indicate that the author handled the situation responsibly once the family started being uncooperative.\n\nLegally, without a formal contract, it's possible that the author could argue ownership based on the exchange of money and items, but it's a gray area. Ethically, the author might have a point given the family's lack of preparation and the emotional manipulation. The author's decision to keep the dog after ensuring the family had the necessary documents and returning extra items seems fair, especially after the family's actions of getting another dog.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be ethically justified given the family's circumstances, legally it's unclear. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the family's role in the situation, maybe the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong). However, if there was an implied agreement to return the dog, the author could be at fault. But given the details provided, the author's reasoning and the family's behavior, B seems more appropriate.\n"
