I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not returning the dog. The situation is that the writer adopted a dog from a family who gave it up after three days. The family is now asking for the dog back. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the adoption process. Was it a legal adoption? If it's just a private sale or a transfer without formal papers, the writer might not be bound by legal obligations. But if there was an agreement, maybe there's an expectation to return the dog under certain conditions.\n\nThe writer invested a lot of time and money. They had to take time off work, travel, and prepare their home. The family, on the other hand, had the dog for only three days before deciding to rehome it. The writer feels the family wasn't ready and that the mom is manipulative. The family is now trying to get the dog back, which causes the writer emotional distress too.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement. If there was no formal contract, maybe the writer isn't obligated to return the dog. But if there was an understanding that it could be retracted, then maybe they are. However, since the writer has already bonded with the dog and made commitments, it might be considered reasonable for them to keep it, especially if the family wasn't responsible in the first place by giving up the dog so quickly.\n\nAlso, the family's behavior seems inconsistent and emotionally manipulative. They got the dog, then decided to give it up quickly, and then tried to take it back. The writer is worried the family might do this again. The writer's actions could be seen as protecting the dog's well-being.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, once a pet is adopted and the transfer is complete, the adopter can have rights unless there's a specific agreement allowing return. The fact that the original owners didn't consider the long-term responsibility might make their claim weaker. The writer's decision to keep the dog could be justified, especially if returning it would be against their best interests and the dog's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). The family didn't show responsibility, and the writer has valid reasons to keep the dog given the circumstances.\n"
