I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. \n\nFirst, the setup: The author adopted a dog from a family after the family decided to give it up just three days after getting it. The author invested a lot of time, money, and effort into the adoption process, including travel, time off work, and preparing their home. They argue that the family wasn't ready for dog ownership, pointing out inconsistencies and the mother's manipulative behavior. The author bonded with the dog and decided to keep it despite the family's emotional appeals.\n\nNow, considering the law and ethics. Legally, adoption agreements can vary, but if there's no formal contract, it might be tricky. Since the author paid a fee and received the dog, the transfer might be considered final once they took possession. However, if the family still had some claim, maybe through a verbal agreement or incomplete paperwork, that could complicate things. But the author mentions that the family didn't provide all the paperwork upfront, which they later had to get. The author started documenting everything after the conflict arose, which might help their case.\n\nEthically, the author's perspective is that the family wasn't responsible pet owners, and keeping the dog prevents it from going back to an unstable environment. The family's actions seem impulsive\u2014getting a dog for three days and then deciding to adopt it out. They also tried to get the dog back while simultaneously getting another one, which looks like they weren't serious. The author's decision to keep the dog could be seen as acting in the dog's best interest.\n\nThe family's side is that they changed their minds, possibly due to emotional reasons involving their daughter. However, as parents, they have a responsibility to consider the dog's welfare, not just their daughter's feelings. Their inconsistency in caring for the dog (only three days) and the mother's manipulative behavior suggest they might not be suitable owners. The author's actions prevent the dog from being in a potentially bad situation again.\n\nIn the updates, the author kept the dog, got the necessary paperwork, and the family tried to trade the dog for another. The author refused, which makes sense since they already bonded with this dog. The family then got a replacement, which might indicate they're trying to fix their mistake. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong because the adoption wasn't formalized with a contract that required return. They acted in the dog's best interest, and the family's actions show they weren't responsible. The author's decisions, while maybe harsh, prioritize the dog's well-being. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
