I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. I need to analyze the situation based on the provided details.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author adopted a dog from a family after the family decided to give it up after just three days. The author made significant investments\u2014time, money, effort\u2014into the adoption process. The family is now asking for the dog back, but the author feels they're not prepared for dog ownership. The mother is described as inconsistent and manipulative, and the family is acting emotionally.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the adoption was a mutual agreement initially? The family changed their mind quickly. The author has bonded with the dog and is concerned about the family's ability to care for it properly. The author decided to keep the dog despite the family's requests. The family then tried to get the dog back again, even while getting another dog, and the author refused.\n\nLegally, if the adoption was formal with paperwork, the author might be bound by the terms. But since it's a private adoption and the family didn't complete the process properly (like giving papers), maybe the situation is more about ethics than law. The author mentions paying a fee and taking items, which the family now want back. The author is holding onto the dog because they believe the family is unstable and not fit to care for it.\n\nEthically, the author is defending their decision by arguing that they're providing a better environment. But did they have the right to decide that for the family? The family did choose to relinquish the dog, which is their right. However, the fact that they did so quickly might indicate they weren't ready, but the author could have considered that before finalizing the adoption. The author's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the family's emotional state, but they also invested a lot and formed a bond.\n\nThe author's updates show that the family is acting inconsistently and even trying to trade the dog. The author's decision to keep the dog is based on protecting the dog's well-being. But if the adoption wasn't legally binding, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the family's initial request. However, the family's subsequent actions (getting another dog) might show they were not sincere in their initial request.\n\nHmm. The key factors are: 1) Whether the adoption was agreed upon, 2) The family's readiness, 3) The author's investment and bond, 4) The family's possible manipulation. If the adoption was a valid agreement, the author is justified. But if the agreement was unclear, the author might be in the wrong. The family's behavior is questionable, but they have the right to the dog if the adoption wasn't final. However, the author's concern for the dog's well-being is valid. It's a tough call. The author might not be in the wrong because they provided a better home, but legally, they might be in the wrong if the adoption wasn't complete. Since the scenario is more about ethics than law, the answer depends on whether the author acted in the dog's best interest despite the family's rights. The author's actions seem justified given the family's instability, so B (not in the wrong) might be the answer.\n"
