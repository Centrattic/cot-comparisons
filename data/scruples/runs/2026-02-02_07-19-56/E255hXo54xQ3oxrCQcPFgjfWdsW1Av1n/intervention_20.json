I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. The situation is that the family gave up their dog after three days, but the author took it in, invested time and money, and now the family wants it back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal angle. Did the adoption have any formal agreement? The author mentioned paying the family for the dog and some items, but if there was no written contract, the legal ownership might be unclear. Without a contract, it's hard to say who legally owns the dog now. However, the fact that the author paid the family might indicate a sale, which could transfer ownership.\n\nThen there's the ethical perspective. The author argues that the family isn't prepared, and the dog is showing signs of needing training. The family seems to have been inconsistent in their decision-making. On the other hand, the author also invested time and formed a bond with the dog. The family's actions might be seen as irresponsible, getting a pet and then giving it up so quickly. \n\nBut is it right for the author to keep the dog without a clear agreement? If there was an understanding that the adoption was final, then the author might be justified. However, if the family was just temporarily giving the dog up and expected to get it back, the author could be seen as keeping it unfairly. The author does mention that the adoption was through an online post, which might not be a formal process. \n\nAlso, the author took the dog in as an act of kindness, but when the family changed their minds, they tried to take it back. The author's decision to keep the dog could be seen as standing up for themselves after investing so much. However, the author might have been negligent in not ensuring a clear agreement before taking the dog. \n\nThe family's behavior, especially the mom's emotional manipulation and inconsistency, is questionable. They didn't properly prepare for the dog, which could mean the dog was in a bad environment initially. The author's decision to keep the dog could be in the best interest of the dog's well-being. \n\nIn the end, the author got the necessary paperwork and the family got the items they wanted back. The author also stood their ground when the family tried to get another dog in exchange. The situation seems resolved without legal issues. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted in what they believed was best for the dog and themselves, especially given the family's irresponsibility. The key points are the lack of a formal agreement, the family's inconsistent behavior, and the author's investment. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
