I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author adopted a dog from a family after it was only with them for 3 days. The family then asked for the dog back. The author invested time, money, and effort into adopting the dog, like taking time off work, preparing their home, and starting to bond with the dog. They mention that the family doesn't seem ready for dog ownership, with the mom being inconsistent and manipulative. The author decided to keep the dog, and the family tried to get it back, even offering a trade for another dog.\n\nNow, considering the details. Legally, adoption agreements usually involve some form of contract. But since this was a private adoption from a family, maybe they didn't have a formal contract. The author paid the family and received some items, but there's a question about the remaining paperwork. The family is now trying to get the dog back, but the author has already bonded with it and set up their home for it.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the family's actions might be questionable. They had the dog for only three days before deciding to rehome it, which isn't a long time to know if they can care for it. The author is concerned about the family's ability to handle dog ownership, especially with the mom's behavior. The author also points out that the family's inconsistency could lead to the dog being given away again or not properly cared for.\n\nThe author's decision to keep the dog is based on their investment and the dog's well-being. They also mention that the family was in a rush and didn't provide all the necessary paperwork initially. The family's attempt to get another dog and offer a trade might indicate they're not serious about learning from their mistake. \n\nHowever, there's a part where the author paid a fee and gave some items to the family. If there was a verbal agreement at the time of adoption that the dog was theirs to keep, the author might be justified in holding onto it. On the other hand, if the adoption wasn't formalized properly, there could be a legal gray area. But the author has documented the transactions and communications, which could support their case.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is prioritizing the dog's stability and their own bond with it. The family's actions seem inconsistent and possibly emotionally manipulative. The author's concerns about the dog's future with the family are valid, especially if the family isn't prepared for the long-term commitment of pet ownership.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions seem justified. They made a commitment to the dog and have invested a lot, while the family's behavior indicates they might not be responsible pet owners. The key points are the family's short time with the dog, their inconsistent behavior, and the author's efforts to ensure the dog's well-being. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
