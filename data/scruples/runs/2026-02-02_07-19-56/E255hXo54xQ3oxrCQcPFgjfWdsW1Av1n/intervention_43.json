I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog. The situation is that they adopted a dog from a family who had it for only three days before deciding to rehome it. The writer invested a lot of time and effort, including traveling, taking time off work, and preparing their home. They also observed the family as unprepared and inconsistent, especially the mom, and felt the dog was being neglected. After the adoption, the family tried to get the dog back, and the writer decided to keep it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If there was no formal adoption contract, the situation might be more about ethics than legality. In many places, a pet adoption becomes legally binding once payment is made and the pet is transferred, but that can vary. However, the user is more interested in whether the author is ethically in the wrong, not just legally.\n\nThe family gave the dog up after three days, which is unusually short. The writer argues that the family wasn't ready for a dog, especially since they were inconsistent and the mom was manipulative. The writer also mentions that they started correcting the dog's behavior, which the original owners didn't do. So, there's a point about responsibility. If the original owners didn't invest the time to train the dog, does that justify the writer keeping it?\n\nAnother angle is the emotional bond. The writer formed a bond with the dog quickly, which is understandable. The family's attempt to take the dog back might cause emotional distress to the dog, depending on the situation. However, the writer also mentions that the family tried to get the dog back for emotional reasons related to their daughter. The writer could be prioritizing the dog's well-being by providing a stable home.\n\nThe writer also mentions that the family showed up with another dog to trade, which seems like a last-minute decision. This might indicate that the family isn't taking the situation seriously, which could support the writer's decision to keep the dog.\n\nBut then, the question is about whether the writer is in the wrong. The writer didn't return the dog as agreed? Wait, were there any agreements? The original adoption seems to be a private transaction without a formal contract. The writer might have accepted the dog for adoption, but if the adoption wasn't formalized with a contract, the writer might have the right to keep the dog, especially if they paid money and took possession.\n\nHowever, if the family had some understanding that they might take the dog back, maybe the writer should have been more cautious. But the family didn't specify that. The writer took the dog believing it was a permanent adoption. The family's decision to take it back after the writer had already invested a lot might be seen as unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer could be accused of being inflexible. If they had a change of heart, maybe they should return the dog. But given the circumstances\u2014like the family's inconsistency and the dog's needs\u2014it's possible the writer is acting in the dog's best interest.\n\nI think the key points are the family's lack of preparation, the writer's investment and bonding, and the ethical responsibility to the dog's well-being. The writer might not be in the wrong because the family wasn't responsible pet owners from the start. Also, the writer is ensuring the dog has a stable home. However, if there was an agreement to return the dog, the writer might be at fault. But since the family didn't specify that, and the writer had no way of knowing, it's more about the family's responsibility.\n"
