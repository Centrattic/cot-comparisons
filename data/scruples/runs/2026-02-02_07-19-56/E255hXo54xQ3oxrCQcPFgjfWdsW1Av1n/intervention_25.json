I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the dog was adopted from a family who had the dog for only three days before deciding to give it up. The author mentions that the family isn't prepared for dog ownership, pointing out the mom's inconsistency and manipulative behavior. The dad had more experience but a busy schedule. The author took significant steps to adopt the dog, including traveling, spending money, time off work, and preparing their home. They also started bonding with the dog and corrected some of its behaviors.\n\nThe family later changed their minds and tried to get the dog back, using emotional arguments about the daughter not handling the situation. The author decided to keep the dog, documenting everything and standing their ground. They even met up with the family again to exchange items and received the remaining paperwork. The family then showed up with another dog and tried to trade, but the author refused.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the description, the adoption wasn't formalized through a rescue or shelter, which might have had a contract. The initial agreement between the author and the family seems to be a private adoption. The family's decision to give the dog up so quickly suggests they weren't committed. The author invested time, money, and effort into the adoption process and has started bonding with the dog. The family's change of heart after the adoption could be seen as not taking their commitment seriously. The author's refusal to return the dog is based on the belief that the family isn't a stable environment for the dog, which is a valid concern for the dog's well-being.\n\nBut legally, if there was no formal agreement, the family might still have a claim to the dog. However, the author has already integrated the dog into their life, and the family's actions seem inconsistent and emotionally driven. The author's decision to keep the dog could be in the dog's best interest, considering the family's lack of preparation. However, without a legal contract, it's a bit of a gray area. Ethically, the author might have a stronger case if the adoption process was completed and the dog is now their responsibility. The fact that the family is getting another dog might indicate they weren't serious about keeping the first one. \n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions are justified. They made a commitment to give the dog a good home, and the original owners didn't follow through with theirs. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
