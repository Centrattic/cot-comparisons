I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog when the original family asked for it back.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The original family had the dog for three days before deciding to rehome it. The adopter (the author) went through a lot of effort: taking a train, renting a car, taking time off work, puppy-proofing their home. They also bonded with the dog and noticed some training issues that they started to correct. The family, especially the mom, changed their mind and want the dog back, using emotional arguments about their daughter not being able to handle the loss. The author is now keeping the dog and even had to meet with the family again to exchange items and documents. The family then tried to trade a new dog in exchange.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the factors:\n\n1. **Legal Aspects**: Did the adoption process involve any formal agreements? The author mentions paying a fee and receiving some items. But if there was no legal contract transferring ownership, the original family might still technically own the dog. However, in many places, once an animal is transferred and the new owner has taken possession, and especially if they paid, it's considered a sale, which might make the return not legally enforceable unless there's a written agreement. But this can vary by location.\n\n2. **Ethical Considerations**: The original family may have made a hasty decision, getting the dog for three days and then deciding to rehome it. The author invested a lot of time and effort, and the dog is starting to bond. The family's inconsistency and the parent's manipulative behavior might make the author right to not return the dog to an unstable environment. On the other hand, the adopter might have been aware that the family was rehoming, so maybe there was an understanding that the dog was up for adoption.\n\n3. **Emotional Investment**: The author mentions bonding with the dog and making preparations. The family is using emotional tactics, which might be manipulative. The author's decision to keep the dog is based on concern for the dog's well-being, considering the family's inconsistent behavior.\n\n4. **Follow-up Actions**: The family tried to get the dog back, then went and got another dog to trade. This shows poor decision-making. The author is firm in their stance, which might be justified given the family's actions post-adoption.\n\nNow, considering all this, the author might be in the right because the family didn't follow through on their initial agreement to rehome the dog. They changed their mind after the adoption was completed, which the author had already acted upon. The author's actions protect the dog from a potentially unstable home and the author's investment. However, if there was no formal agreement, the family might still have a legal claim, but ethically, the author is justified in keeping the dog to prevent further instability for the animal.\n\nSo the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author acted in the dog's best interest and followed through on a completed adoption, despite the original family's change of heart.\n"
