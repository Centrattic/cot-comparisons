I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog when the family asked for it back. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points from the original post are:\n\n- The author adopted a dog from a family after the family had the dog for only 3 days before deciding to give it up.\n- The author invested time, money, and effort into preparing for the dog, including taking time off work and puppy-proofing their home.\n- The family had the dog for only 3 days, and the mother seemed inconsistent and manipulative in her actions.\n- The author has already bonded with the dog and is concerned about the family's ability to care for the dog properly.\n- After the adoption, the family tried to get the dog back again, even after the author had made a decision to keep it. The author eventually exchanged the dog items for paperwork, but the family then showed up with another dog and tried to trade, which the author refused.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. \n\nLegally, if there was a formal adoption process, there might be contracts or agreements in place. However, in many informal adoptions (like from a private individual, especially in a situation like this), the rights aren't as clear. The original family gave up the dog for adoption, so once the author has taken the dog and completed the transaction, the responsibility typically transfers to the new owner. The family coming back after a short time to reclaim the dog seems problematic, especially since they didn't keep the dog for long and didn't seem prepared for dog ownership.\n\nThe author's points about the family's inconsistency and the mother's behavior might support the idea that the family isn't capable of responsible dog ownership. The author has already made commitments and investments, and the bond formed with the dog adds emotional weight to the decision to keep it. The fact that the family then tried to trade for another dog suggests they might not have learned from their mistakes, but the author's refusal to comply could be seen as standing up for their decision once the adoption was finalized.\n\nHowever, there's a lack of clarity on whether there was a binding agreement. If the adoption was informal and without a contract, the family might still claim ownership. But in practice, once the dog is with the new owner and the transaction is complete, the new owner is generally considered the responsible party. The family's actions could be seen as unethical, given that they gave up the dog quickly and then tried to retrieve it, which could be seen as irresponsibly moving the dog around.\n\nThe author's decision to keep the dog, after investing time and effort and forming a bond, seems justified. The family's change of heart after such a short time and their inconsistent behavior might make the author's decision the more responsible one. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
