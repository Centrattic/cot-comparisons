I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for keeping the dog after the original family asked for it back. The author went through a process of adopting a dog from a family who had the dog for only three days before deciding to give it up. The author invested time, money, and emotional energy into the adoption, including traveling and preparing their home. They argue that the family wasn't ready for a dog, and the mom's behavior was manipulative. They also mention that the family later tried to get the dog back while getting a replacement, and the author refused.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. If it was a formal adoption through a shelter or rescue, there might be a contract or return policy. But since this was a private adoption between individuals, the terms might be less clear. The author paid the family a fee and took on the dog. If there was no formal agreement stating that the family could take the dog back, the author might have the right to keep it. However, if there was an understanding or verbal agreement that it's a temporary placement until the family could take ownership again, that might change things. But the original family didn't keep the dog for an adequate time to assess if they could care for it properly. Three days isn't enough to form a bond or see if the dog is a good fit, so maybe the author is right to question their commitment.\n\nEthically, the author feels they've already bonded with the dog and invested a lot, and they're concerned about the original family's ability to care for the dog long-term. They also mention the mom being emotionally manipulative, which complicates things. The author made the decision to keep the dog after weighing these factors. The family then tried to get the dog back while acquiring another one, which seems like poor behavior. The author's refusal to trade the dogs might be justified given the family's inconsistency.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did agree to take the dog in with the understanding that it might be a temporary situation. If they knew from the start that the family could take it back, maybe they should have been cautious. However, the original family didn't give the dog a fair trial period, so the author's decision to keep the dog after the family's instability is shown could be seen as protecting the dog's welfare. \n\nLegally, unless there's a contract requiring return, the author might not be in the wrong. Ethically, considering the family's actions and the dog's best interest, the author's choice could be justified. So, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
