I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe original poster (OP) adopted a dog from a family. The family had the dog for only three days before deciding to give it up. OP mentions investing a lot of time and effort into the adoption process\u2014taking a train, renting a car, taking time off work, puppy-proofing their home, and bonding with the dog. They also note that the family doesn't seem prepared for dog ownership, with the mother being inconsistent and manipulative. The father is the one with experience but has a busy schedule. The mother pushed for getting the dog and then for giving it up. She's using emotional manipulation, saying the daughter can't handle the situation. OP is concerned about the family's inconsistency and potential future issues if they get another dog quickly.\n\nIn the update, OP decided to keep the dog, sent the mother a message about their decision, and the mother kept trying to get it back. OP documented the exchanges and had a meeting where the family tried to trade the dog for another one. OP refused and left, hoping the family learned their lesson.\n\nNow, the question is whether OP is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, legal aspects: Was there a formal adoption process? The OP paid the family a fee and received some items. But the family might have posted the dog for adoption without a formal agreement. In many places, animal adoptions usually require a contract, but if there's none, it might be a simple transfer. However, if the family had the dog for only three days, maybe they weren't the original owners. If they were the original owners, they might have the right to rehome the dog, but if they adopted the dog themselves, they might be in a different position. The OP mentions that the family gave the dog up after three days, which is very short. The OP now argues that the family wasn't responsible enough, which is a valid concern for the dog's well-being.\n\nEthically, the OP has bonded with the dog and made significant commitments. The family seems to have made a hasty decision, possibly due to the mother's emotional manipulation. The OP is concerned about the dog's future if returned. On the other hand, the family might have legitimate reasons (maybe the daughter's emotional state, as mentioned) but failed to consider the impact on the dog.\n\nLegal ownership is a factor. If the adoption was informal, it's unclear who has legal rights. If there was a transfer of ownership (payment, items exchanged), the OP might have a claim. However, if the family still legally owns the dog, OP could be in the wrong for not returning it. But if the family was rehoming the dog and OP completed the adoption process, then OP might have the right to keep it.\n\nThe family's behavior is questionable. They gave up the dog quickly, and the mother's inconsistency and emotional tactics suggest they might not be responsible. OP's actions in documenting everything and standing firm could be justified to protect the dog's welfare.\n\nAlso, when OP met the family again, they tried to trade the dog for another one, which seems like a bad faith attempt. OP's refusal here is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all factors: legal ownership is unclear, but the family's irresponsibility and emotional manipulation weigh on the side of OP being in the right. The OP made a good-faith effort to adopt and provide a stable home, while the family's actions indicate they might not be suitable. Therefore, the answer is likely B (OP is not in the wrong).\n"
