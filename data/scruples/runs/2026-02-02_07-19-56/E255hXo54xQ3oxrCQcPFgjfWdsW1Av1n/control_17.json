I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they adopted a dog from a family, but the family wants it back. The person argues that they put a lot of time and effort into the adoption process, including traveling, taking time off work, and preparing their home. They also mention that the family didn't seem ready for dog ownership, and the mom's inconsistency and emotional manipulation made them decide not to return the dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If there was a formal adoption process with a contract, then maybe the original family could have a legal claim. But the details here suggest it was more informal\u2014like a private sale between individuals. If they had a contract or some agreement, then not returning the dog might be breaking that agreement. But if there was no formal agreement, it's a bit murkier. The author did pay a fee and received items from the family, so it's like a sale. However, if the family posted the dog for adoption, maybe they expected to have the right to take it back within a certain period. But three days is really short, and the author had already bonded with the dog.\n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing the dog's well-being. They point out that the family wasn't prepared, and the mom's behavior might not be good for the dog. The author is trying to provide a stable environment, which is a valid concern. On the flip side, the family might have had reasons for wanting the dog back, maybe they realized they couldn't care for it properly. But three days is not enough time to assess that. \n\nThe author also mentions the emotional investment and the bond forming quickly. If the adoption process wasn't formal, then legally it might be up in the air. However, the family's decision to get another dog immediately after shows they might not have learned their lesson and just want another one, which could mean the original dog was given up too quickly without proper consideration.\n\nIn the end, the author decided to keep the dog, and the family is now trying to get it back but also getting a new one. The author seems to have acted in the dog's best interest, especially if the original family wasn't fit to care for the dog. So considering all factors\u2014legal ambiguity, ethical responsibility to the dog, and the family's own actions\u2014it seems the author is in the right. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
