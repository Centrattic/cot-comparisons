I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not returning the dog. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user adopted a dog from a family who posted the dog for adoption after only three days. The user went through a lot of trouble\u2014taking a train, renting a car, taking time off work, puppy-proofing their home. They also mention that the family doesn't seem prepared for dog ownership, especially the mom who seems inconsistent and manipulative. The father had the most experience but a busy schedule. The mom wanted to get the dog back, using emotional arguments about their daughter being too young to handle the situation. The author has bonded with the dog and decided to keep it, which the family is trying to get back. They even tried to trade another dog for the original one, but the author refused.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the original agreement. The user adopted the dog from the family, which implies a transfer of ownership. Usually, adoption is a permanent decision, but since it was a private adoption (not through a shelter or rescue), the terms might be more flexible. However, the family only had the dog for three days before deciding to give it up, which is very short. That raises questions about their readiness and commitment to the dog. The user argues that the family isn't prepared and that the mom's actions are manipulative. \n\nThe user invested a lot of time, effort, and money into the adoption process. They've already bonded with the dog and set up their home for it. The family is now asking for the dog back, possibly due to a change of heart or poor decision-making. The user's decision to keep the dog is based on the fact that they've built a good environment for the dog and are concerned about the family's ability to care for it properly. \n\nLegally, without a formal contract, it's unclear. But ethically, if the adoption was agreed upon in good faith, the user might not be obligated to give the dog back unless there was a specific agreement. The family's behavior\u2014the mom being emotionally manipulative and trying to get the dog back after only a few days\u2014could suggest they weren't serious. The user is protecting the dog's best interest by not returning it to a potentially unstable environment.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of trust and agreements. If the adoption was mutual and the user accepted the dog, then breaking that agreement could be seen as the user's fault. But given that the family didn't take proper care of the dog in the first three days and are now being inconsistent, maybe the user is justified. Also, the family's attempt to trade another dog shows they might not respect the original agreement.\n\nIn terms of the user's actions, they documented everything, returned extra items, and met the family to exchange papers. They seem reasonable and responsible, whereas the family appears to be acting irresponsibly. The user's priority is the dog's well-being, which is a strong ethical point in their favor. The fact that the family was getting another dog right after trying to take this one back suggests they weren't committed to the original dog, reinforcing the user's decision to keep it.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the user isn't in the wrong because the family didn't prepare properly, acted inconsistently, and the user has provided a better environment for the dog. The user's actions seem reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
