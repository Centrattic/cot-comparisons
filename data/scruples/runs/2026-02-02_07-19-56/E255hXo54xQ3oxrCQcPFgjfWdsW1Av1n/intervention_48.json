I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author adopted a dog from a family who then asked for the dog back the next day. The author is keeping the dog, and the question is whether they're wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the adoption was formal, maybe with paperwork, then there might be specific terms about returning the dog. But from the description, it seems like the adoption wasn't formalized properly. The author mentions paying a fee and getting some documents later, but initially, the meeting was late at night and the paperwork wasn't all there. So maybe there was no binding contract here. If there's no legal agreement, then the situation is more about ethics rather than law.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The family had the dog for three days before deciding to adopt it out, which is very short. The author points out that the family doesn't seem ready for dog ownership, especially with the mom being inconsistent. The father had more experience but was busy. The author put in a lot of effort\u2014traveling, preparing the home, bonding\u2014and now feels a strong connection. \n\nOn the other hand, the family might have had a change of heart for a valid reason. The author mentions the mom being emotionally manipulative, but maybe the family had a genuine issue, like the daughter struggling. However, the family's actions seem inconsistent. They got the dog, then decided to give it up quickly, and now want it back. That inconsistency might make the author question the family's ability to care for the dog.\n\nThe author also mentions that the family showed up with another dog and tried to trade, which seems like they didn't learn their lesson. The author's decision to keep the dog might be based on ensuring the dog's well-being, especially if the family is not responsible.\n\nBut was there an agreement? If the family agreed to the adoption and then changed their mind, the author might have a right to keep the dog, especially if the family didn't follow through on their part of the deal. The author also documented everything and tried to return the items, which shows they're trying to handle it responsibly.\n\nIn summary, if there was no formal contract, the author isn't legally obligated to return the dog. Ethically, if the family was negligent or inconsistent in their care, keeping the dog might be the right choice. The author's detailed effort to provide a good home versus the family's quick change of heart suggests the author is acting in the dog's best interest. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
