I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author adopted a dog from a family after the family had the dog for only three days. The family then changed their minds and asked for the dog back. The author invested time, money, and effort to take the dog, including taking time off work, preparing their home, and bonding with the dog. They also mention that the family doesn't seem ready for dog ownership, especially the mom being inconsistent.\n\nThe key points here are the terms of the adoption. Did they have a formal agreement? The author paid a fee and some extra for items, but there's no mention of a written contract. The family might argue that since they changed their minds, the author should return the dog. However, the author argues that the family wasn't prepared and that returning the dog would be in the dog's best interest. \n\nLegally, without a contract, it's tricky. If this was a legal adoption, there might be specific terms. But if it's more of an informal agreement, either party can back out unless there's an agreement in place. However, the author has already spent resources and bonded with the dog. The family's inconsistency and the short time they had the dog might support the author's decision.\n\nAlso, the family's behavior\u2014emotionally pressuring the author and trying to get the dog back\u2014could indicate they weren't responsible owners. The author's concern about the dog's well-being in an inconsistent environment is valid. The update where the family got another dog while trying to get theirs back shows their irresponsibility.\n\nBut legally, if there's no contract, the author might not have a legal claim. However, morally, considering the family's actions, the author's stance could be justified. The author documented everything, which is good, but the main issue is whether they were obligated to return the dog. Since the adoption wasn't formalized, the author's decision to keep the dog might be seen as reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted in the dog's best interest and the family wasn't responsible. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
