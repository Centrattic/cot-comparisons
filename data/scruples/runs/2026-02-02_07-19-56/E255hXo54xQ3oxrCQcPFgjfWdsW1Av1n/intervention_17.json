I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not returning their adopted dog. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the author adopted a dog from a family after three days. The family is now asking for the dog back. The author has spent a lot of time and money to take the dog in, including traveling, taking time off work, and preparing their home. They mention that the family doesn't seem ready for dog ownership, especially the mom, who they describe as inconsistent and manipulative. The mom is emotionally bullying them, saying their daughter can't handle the situation. The author is bonding with the dog and doesn't want to give it back. In an update, they decided to keep the dog and met the family again, where the family had another dog and tried to trade. The author refused.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the adoption was a formal process with paperwork and payment, that might imply some legal obligation. But if it was a more informal arrangement, maybe it's different. The author paid the family a fee and took some of their dog items, which the family now want back. Also, the author didn't get all the vet paperwork upfront, which is a bit of a problem. The family might have a claim if they still have the original ownership documents, but the author got some of them later. \n\nThe family's actions seem a bit erratic. They gave the dog up after only three days, which is a very short time. The author points out that the family might not be responsible dog owners, especially if the mom is manipulative and the dad is busy. The author's reasoning is that keeping the dog is better for the dog's well-being, given the family's inconsistency. But if the adoption process was agreed upon, even if it was short, the author might be in a difficult position. \n\nOn the other hand, the author made a commitment and followed through, investing resources. The family is now going back on their decision. The author's concern about the dog's future in an unstable environment is valid. But legally, if the adoption is not official, the family might still claim ownership. However, in many places, once a pet is transferred to someone and the original owner is no longer caring for them, the new owner might have a claim, especially if they've bonded and have documentation. \n\nThe author's updates show they are trying to resolve the issue by exchanging items for paperwork and meeting the family. The fact that the family got another dog right after suggests they were insincere in their original decision, which might support the author's choice to keep the dog. The emotional manipulation by the mom is a red flag. Ethically, it might be better to keep the dog if the original owners were irresponsible. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the adoption was a private agreement without legal formalities, it's possible the family could still claim the dog. However, the author's actions in documenting everything and standing their ground might protect them. The key points are the original agreement terms and the dog's well-being. Since the family didn't properly prepare for dog ownership and the author is providing a stable home, the author's decision could be justified. \n\nSo, in this case, if the adoption was agreed upon with payment and transfer, and the family is now trying to renege, the author might not be in the wrong. The family's irresponsibility and the dog's better life with the author are important factors. Legally, it's a bit murky, but ethically, the author's choice seems right. So I'd lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
