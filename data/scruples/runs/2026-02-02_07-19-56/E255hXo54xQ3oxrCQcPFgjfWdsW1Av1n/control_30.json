I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author adopted a dog from a family after the family had had it for only three days. They mention investing time and money into the adoption\u2014taking a train, renting a car, puppy-proofing their home, taking time off work. They also note that the family doesn't seem prepared for dog ownership, with the mom being inconsistent and manipulative. The dad had the most experience but a busy schedule. The mom wanted to get the dog back, using emotional manipulation, saying their daughter can't handle the situation. The author bonded with the dog quickly and decided to keep it.\n\nSo, the first thing to consider is the legal aspect. Did they have a formal adoption agreement? The story says they paid a fee and exchanged some items. But it sounds like it was a private, informal adoption. Without a legal contract, the situation might be tricky. In many places, pet adoptions aren't legally binding unless there's a written agreement transferring ownership. If there's no contract, the original owners might still legally own the dog, which could mean the author is in the wrong for not returning it.\n\nBut then there's the ethical side. The family gave up the dog quickly, and the author has already bonded with it and made significant preparations. The family's actions seem inconsistent and possibly manipulative. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being if returned to an unprepared household. On the other hand, the family might be in a tough spot emotionally, especially the daughter, and the author's refusal could be seen as selfish.\n\nThe updates mention that the author kept the dog and the family tried to get it back, even bringing another dog to trade. The author documented everything, which is smart. But legally, if there's no contract, the family could potentially take the matter to court. However, if the author can prove that the adoption was mutual and the family is now being unreasonable, the author's stance might be justified. Also, the fact that the family is acting inconsistently and the author is providing a stable environment could weigh in the author's favor ethically.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, once you've adopted a pet and have a good faith belief that you're the rightful owner, especially if you've been caring for it, courts might side with the new owner if the original owners were negligent. But this varies widely. The author's decision to keep the dog is supported by their investment and the family's unpreparedness, but without legal paperwork, there's ambiguity.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong ethically if the family was unprepared and the adoption was informal. But legally, without a contract, they might be in a weaker position. However, the family's actions (like trying to get another dog and using emotional manipulation) could also reflect poorly on them. The author's decision to keep the dog and focus on the dog's well-being is understandable. \n\nGiven the details, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, especially if there's no legal agreement. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
