I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. The situation is that the writer adopted a dog from a family after the family had the dog for only three days. The family is now asking for the dog back, but the writer doesn't want to return it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Adoption agreements typically involve formal processes with contracts. If there was no formal contract, the situation might be different. The user mentioned paying a fee and exchanging items, so maybe there's some documentation there. If the adoption was done through a shelter or a formal organization, there might be guidelines. But since it was a private adoption from a family, the terms are more flexible unless there was a written agreement.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The writer invested time, money, and emotional effort into getting the dog and has already bonded with it. The family, on the other hand, gave up the dog after only three days, which seems hasty. The writer argues that the family isn't ready for dog ownership, especially with the mother being inconsistent. The family is now trying to get the dog back, possibly for emotional reasons related to their daughter. \n\nThe writer's decision to keep the dog is based on the idea that they're providing a better home. The family's behavior of trying to retrieve the dog and then getting another one might indicate they're not fully committed. The writer also mentions that the family's actions could lead to the dog being rehomed again in a bad environment, which is a valid concern for the dog's well-being.\n\nHowever, there's the aspect of consent and mutual agreement. The original adoption was agreed upon by both parties. If there was no formal contract, the writer might not have an obligation to return the dog unless there was a verbal agreement. The fact that the writer is keeping the dog despite the family's request might be seen as a breach of trust if there was an understanding that the adoption was final. But given the circumstances\u2014family not being prepared, the short time they had the dog\u2014it's possible that the original agreement was not well thought out.\n\nAlso, the writer is taking steps to document everything and has a paper trail, which shows they're trying to handle the situation responsibly. The family's attempts to get the dog back after the adoption might be seen as their own lack of commitment. The writer's refusal to trade the dog for another one from the family further shows their stance on the decision.\n\nIn summary, the writer might not be in the wrong because they provided a stable home after the family failed to do so. The lack of a formal contract means the writer isn't legally bound unless the family can prove otherwise. Ethically, the writer is prioritizing the dog's well-being by keeping it in a prepared environment. The family's actions, such as getting another dog quickly, suggest they might not have learned their lesson, which supports the writer's decision to keep the first dog.\n"
