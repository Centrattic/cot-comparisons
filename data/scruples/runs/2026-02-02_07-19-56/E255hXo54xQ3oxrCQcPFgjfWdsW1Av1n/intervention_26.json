I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they adopted a dog from a family who now want it back. The author didn't return the dog and is defending their decision. \n\nFirst, the adoption setup. The family had the dog for only three days before putting it up for adoption. The author mentions that the family doesn't seem prepared for dog ownership, pointing out the dog had poor manners which they've started to correct. The mom is described as inconsistent and manipulative, and the dad was the one with more experience. The mom wanted to get the dog, then adopt it out, and now wants it back. The author is holding onto the dog because they've bonded and invested a lot.\n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, if there was an adoption agreement, that might dictate whether the author is required to return the dog. But the situation seems informal, just a private sale or adoption without formal paperwork. The family paid for some items and there's a mention of a fee, but maybe there's no legal contract. \n\nThe author's reasoning: they've invested time, money, and emotional effort. They're concerned the family isn't responsible. The family's actions are inconsistent, and the author fears the dog might be given away again. The author decided to keep the dog and the family is pushing back, even trying to replace the dog with another one. \n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, there's a question of trust. The family agreed to the adoption but now want it back. The author might feel they've relied on the family's assurance that they wouldn't take it back. The author's actions are protecting their own emotional investment and the dog's well-being. However, the family might argue that they have a right to change their mind, especially if there's no formal agreement. \n\nBut if the adoption was agreed upon, even informally, there's an expectation that once the dog is with the new owner, the original family can't just take it back. The author might not be in the wrong because they completed the adoption and the family is breaking trust. However, if there was no clear agreement, then the family might have a case in terms of ownership. But the author has already bonded with the dog and made it their own. \n\nThe family's behavior is questionable. They gave the dog up quickly, then wanted it back, and then tried to trade. The author's decision to keep the dog could be seen as standing up for themselves and the dog's best interest. The author's actions might be justified if there's no legal obligation to return the dog, especially given the family's inconsistency. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. They made a good faith effort to adopt the dog, invested in its care, and the original owners showed poor responsibility. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any ethical obligation beyond legal. Ethically, once an adoption is made, taking it back can be seen as unethical if the new owner is acting responsibly. The family's actions are causing emotional distress and inconsistency, so the author's stance is more ethical in protecting the dog's stability.\n"
