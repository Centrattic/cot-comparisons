I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is wrong for not returning the adopted dog. The scenario is that they adopted a dog from a family who wanted it back after just three days. The author spent a lot of time, money, and effort to take the dog, and they argue that the family wasn't ready for a dog.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If there was a formal adoption process, there might be some legal obligation. But in this case, it seems like a private adoption through a family. The key points are that the family gave the dog up after only three days, and the author took it to a new home. The author mentions they paid the family for some dog items and had a transaction. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the family isn't suitable for dog ownership, especially pointing out the mother's inconsistency and emotional manipulation. They also feel bonded with the dog now and don't want to give it back. On the other hand, the family might argue that they changed their minds and want their dog back.\n\nLegally, if there was no formal contract or agreement, the situation might be murky. In many places, once an animal is transferred to a new owner, it's hard to claim it back unless there's a written agreement. But the family might have a moral claim if they paid for the dog or if there's some understanding that they can take it back. However, in this case, the author paid the family for some items, which complicates things.\n\nEthically, the author might be right in prioritizing the dog's well-being. If the family wasn't prepared and the dog was exhibiting bad behaviors that the author is correcting, keeping the dog could be better for the animal. The family's inconsistency in caring for the dog also raises concerns about their ability to provide a stable home.\n\nThe author also mentions that the family was trying to get the dog back for emotional reasons related to the daughter. However, as the parent, they have a responsibility to make decisions in the best interest of the pet, not just the child. If they can't provide a stable environment, then the author's decision to keep the dog might be justified.\n\nAnother point is the author's actions after the initial adoption. They documented everything, which is wise, and they met with the family to exchange items and get paperwork. The family then tried to trade the dog for another, which seems manipulative. The author's refusal to engage in that trade is understandable, especially given the previous behavior of the family.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some moral ambiguity, the author's actions seem to be in the best interest of the dog, considering the family's lack of preparation and inconsistency. The author's investment and the dog's well-being support their decision to keep the dog. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
