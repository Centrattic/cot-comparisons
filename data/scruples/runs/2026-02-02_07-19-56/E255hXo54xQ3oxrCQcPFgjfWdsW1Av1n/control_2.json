I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author adopted a dog from a family, but the family wants it back the next day. The author went through a lot of effort to adopt the dog\u2014taking a train, renting a car, taking time off work, preparing their home. They also mention that the family wasn't ready for dog ownership, with the mom being inconsistent and manipulative, and the dad being busy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the adoption wasn't formalized with a legal contract, maybe there's no binding agreement. But if there was some payment involved, that complicates things. The author paid the family a fee and took items from them. Legally, once a transaction is completed, it's harder to reverse unless there's a specific agreement. \n\nEthically, the author argues that the family wasn't responsible and that keeping the dog is better for the dog's well-being. The family, on the other hand, might feel regret and want the dog back for emotional reasons, especially involving their daughter. But as parents, they have a responsibility to be consistent in their decisions. If they got a dog on a whim and then changed their minds quickly, that's their mistake. The author took steps to correct the dog's behavior and has already bonded with it, which adds emotional weight to their decision.\n\nThe family's actions seem impulsive. Three days isn't enough time to know if they can handle a dog, especially considering the commitment needed. The author's refusal to return the dog could be seen as standing up for their own investment and the dog's best interest. However, the author might be in the wrong if there was an expectation that the family could take the dog back quickly. But given the lack of preparation from the family, the author's decision seems justified.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned documenting everything, which shows they're aware of the potential conflict and are protecting themselves. The family then tried to trade the dog for another one, which the author rightfully refused. It seems like the author is prioritizing the dog's stability and their own commitment compared to the family's inconsistency.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision based on the dog's future and their own commitment, while the family's actions were hasty and inconsistent.\n"
