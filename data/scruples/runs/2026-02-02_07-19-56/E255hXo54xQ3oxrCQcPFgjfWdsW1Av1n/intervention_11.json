I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not returning the dog. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: They adopted a dog from a family, but after just three days, the family is asking for the dog back. The author invested a lot of time and money\u2014taking time off work, traveling, puppy-proofing their home. They also mention correcting the dog's behavior, which they started doing right after taking the dog. \n\nThe family's side: They had the dog for three days before posting for adoption. The mom is portrayed as inconsistent and manipulative, pushing to get the dog back, maybe for the daughter's emotional reasons. The father is more experienced but has a busy schedule. The author is concerned about the family's ability to properly care for the dog, given their short time with it and the mom's behavior.\n\nThe author decided not to return the dog, citing their investment and the family's unpreparedness. They also mention the family is now trying to get a replacement dog, even offering to trade. The author kept the dog and ended up meeting the family again to exchange some items.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, adoptions typically require some form of contract or agreement. If there was no formal agreement, the situation might be more complex. But the author mentioned paying a fee and some items, so maybe there was a transaction. However, if the family posted the dog for adoption, maybe there was an understanding that the dog could be returned under certain conditions. But three days is very short, and the author has already bonded with the dog and made significant preparations.\n\nEthically, the author argues that the family wasn't ready to care for the dog and that the dog would be better off with them. The family, on the other hand, might feel that they had a change of heart and want the dog back, possibly for their daughter's emotional well-being. However, the author's perspective is that the family didn't put in the effort to adjust, leading to the dog's behavioral issues.\n\nAnother point is the author's decision to keep the dog after investing so much. They also mention that the family showed up with another dog and tried to trade, which the author refused. The author's actions seem to prioritize the dog's well-being and their own commitment, while the family's actions might be seen as flippant or inconsistent.\n\nBut is it right for the author to take the dog permanently? If there was a mutual agreement for adoption, then the family might have a claim. However, since the adoption was recent and the family didn't put in the same effort, the author's stance could be justified. The key factors here are whether there was a binding agreement and whether the family's reasons for wanting the dog back are valid. The author's argument is that the family wasn't prepared, which adds to the ethical dilemma.\n\nIn many cases, adoptions are considered final unless there's a specific clause allowing returns. If there was no such clause, the author is in the right. Additionally, the author is providing a stable environment, which benefits the dog. The family's inconsistency and the mom's manipulative behavior further support the author's decision. The author also mentions documenting everything, showing they took precautions. \n\nSo considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a responsible decision after assessing the situation and ensuring the dog's best interest, especially given the family's shortcomings.\n"
