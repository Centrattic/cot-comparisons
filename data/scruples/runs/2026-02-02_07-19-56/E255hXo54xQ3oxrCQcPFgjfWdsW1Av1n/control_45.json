I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author adopted a dog from a family. The family had the dog for only three days before deciding to give it up. The author went through a lot of effort: taking a train, renting a car, taking time off work, preparing their home, and bonding with the dog. The family now wants the dog back, and the author is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If there was no formal adoption contract, the situation might be more about mutual agreement. But the author mentioned paying the family a fee and getting some items. However, the family didn't provide all the vet papers upfront. The author is holding onto the papers until they meet again. Also, the family is now trying to get the dog back and even offered to trade with another dog. The author is keeping the dog and has a post-adoption bonding experience.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they invested a lot and believe the family isn't ready for dog ownership. The family's mom seems inconsistent and manipulative, and the dad is trying to explain things. The author is concerned about the dog's well-being if returned to an unstable environment.\n\nNow, considering both sides. Legally, if there's no contract, the family might argue that since they gave up ownership, the author isn't obligated to return the dog. But if there was an agreement to give the dog up for adoption, even without a contract, the author's refusal might be seen as breaking that agreement. However, the family's actions (only keeping the dog for three days, inconsistent care) might make their claim weaker, especially from an animal welfare standpoint.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they are protecting the dog's best interests by not sending it back to a family that hasn't shown stability. On the other hand, the original owners might feel they have the right to reclaim the dog if the adoption was a mistake. The author's decision to keep the dog could be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the family made a hasty decision.\n\nBut wait, the author paid for the adoption, which might imply an agreement. However, if the adoption wasn't formalized, it's a bit gray. The fact that the family is now getting another dog might indicate that they realized their mistake, but the author's refusal to return the dog and the subsequent meeting where the family tried to trade dogs complicates things.\n\nIn terms of community standards, like on Reddit, people often empathize with the person who invested more time and resources, especially when the other side seems inconsistent. The author's detailed explanation about the family's unpreparedness and the dog's well-being could sway opinions in their favor. However, there's also a principle that once something is given away for adoption, you can't just take it back, especially if the adopter is responsible and committed.\n\nAnother angle: the author had the opportunity to take care of the dog, which the family couldn't do. The family's actions (only three days, inconsistent care) might not have been in the dog's best interest initially. The author's decision to keep the dog could be seen as preventing the dog from going through another stressful situation with the same family.\n\nBut then again, the author could have considered mediation or other options instead of unilaterally deciding to keep the dog. However, given the family's behavior, the author might have felt it necessary to protect the dog's future.\n\nI think the key factors here are the lack of a formal agreement, the family's hasty decision to give up the dog, the author's investment and bonding, and the potential for the family to make the same mistake again. The author's refusal to return the dog, while possibly ethically justified, might be legally a bit iffy. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's more about whether they acted unreasonably. Given the circumstances, the author's actions seem reasonable, especially prioritizing the dog's well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
