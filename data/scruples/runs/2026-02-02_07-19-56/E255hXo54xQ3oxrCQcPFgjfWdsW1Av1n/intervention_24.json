I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author adopted a dog from a family after it was with them for just three days. The family is now asking for the dog back, but the author has invested time, money, and effort into the adoption. The family's mother seems manipulative and inconsistent, and the author is concerned about the dog's future if they return it. The author decided to keep the dog and even met with the family again, where the family tried to trade the dog for another one. The author refused and now the situation seems resolved.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if there was no formal contract or agreement, the situation might be murky. The author paid a fee and some items, but if the adoption wasn't finalized with legal paperwork, the family might still have a claim. However, the author had the dog for some time, bonded with it, and made changes to their life for the dog. The family's sudden change of heart after three days could be seen as irresponsible, especially since they didn't prepare for dog ownership properly.\n\nEthically, the author's concern for the dog's well-being is valid. If the family is inconsistent and the mother is manipulative, keeping the dog might be in the dog's best interest. The author is providing a stable environment, which is crucial for a dog's upbringing. The family's actions could lead to the dog being re-homed again, which is stressful for the animal. \n\nHowever, the initial agreement might have been a simple understanding without legal binding terms, so technically, the family might still have a right to ask for the dog back if there was no formal contract. The author might be in a gray area here, but their justification for keeping the dog is based on the family's irresponsibility and the dog's well-being. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision might be ethically justifiable, even if legally they might have some responsibility. Since the user is asking for a choice between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no), the answer leans towards B. The author isn't in the wrong based on the family's actions and the dog's welfare.\n"
