I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. The situation is that they adopted a dog from a family who had it for three days before deciding to give it up. The original poster (OP) felt the family wasn't prepared, and the mother was manipulative. The family later changed their mind and wanted the dog back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. OP invested a lot of time, money, and effort into adopting the dog. They had to take time off work, travel, and prepare their home. The family, on the other hand, only had the dog for three days before posting for adoption. That seems hasty. The OP has a point about the family not being responsible if they can't commit for at least a few weeks.\n\nThe family's actions might be considered unethical because they decided to adopt without really trying to handle the responsibility. If someone gets a pet and gives it up so quickly, maybe they weren't serious. But legally, unless there was a formal contract, the situation is murky. Without a contract, it's hard to say who has legal rights here.\n\nEmotionally, both sides are hurting. The family might feel regret, but OP has also formed a bond with the dog. The family's behavior, especially the mother's, seems manipulative as described. The fact that they tried to emotionally pressure OP and then tried to trade dogs complicates things further.\n\nThe update says OP kept the dog and the family got a replacement. The family's actions of getting another dog while trying to reclaim the first one might show they weren't serious. OP's decision to keep the dog could be seen as standing up for their own commitment and the dog's well-being, especially if the family isn't providing a stable environment.\n\nBut there's a question about the initial adoption process. If the adoption wasn't formalized with a contract, OP might not have had the right to keep the dog. However, since they've already spent time and money, some might argue they did the right thing by providing a better home. The family's inconsistency in caring for the dog and their quick reversal could support OP's decision.\n\nIn the end, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, it might depend on local laws and whether there was a proper adoption process. Ethically, OP's actions could be justified by the family's lack of responsibility and the dog's best interest. So, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
