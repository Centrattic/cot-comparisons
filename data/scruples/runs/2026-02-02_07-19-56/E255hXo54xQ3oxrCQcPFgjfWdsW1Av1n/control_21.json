I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not returning the dog. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author adopted a dog from a family after the family had the dog for just three days. The family then changed their minds and asked for the dog back. The author invested time, money, and effort into adopting the dog, including traveling, puppy-proofing their home, and bonding with the dog. They mention that the family doesn't seem ready for dog ownership, especially the mother, who they think is inconsistent and manipulative. The family is using emotional tactics, saying their daughter can't handle the situation, which the author finds hypocritical since they didn't consider that before getting the dog in the first place.\n\nThe author decided to keep the dog and later met the family again, where the family tried to trade the dog for a new one. The author refused and ended up getting the necessary paperwork while giving back some extra items.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, this depends on the terms of the adoption. If there was no formal agreement, it might be a gray area. However, typically, once an adoption is finalized, even informally, the new owner has rights. The family might have a moral obligation if they agreed to the adoption, but if they didn't have a contract, it's tricky. \n\nThe family's actions\u2014taking the dog for only three days and then changing their minds\u2014suggest they weren't committed. The author's investment and the dog's well-being are factors. The family's emotional bullying and inconsistency (getting a replacement dog) might indicate they aren't responsible owners. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author might be in the right because they provided a stable home and the family didn't follow through on their responsibility. However, if the adoption wasn't formalized with an agreement, the family could argue they can reclaim the dog. But given the circumstances, the author's decision to keep the dog after investing so much and considering the family's lack of preparedness might be justified. The author also took steps to document everything, which supports their position. The family's attempt to trade the dog later shows their inconsistency. \n\nIn conclusion, without a formal adoption agreement, it's a bit ambiguous, but the author's actions seem reasonable given the family's behavior and lack of commitment. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
