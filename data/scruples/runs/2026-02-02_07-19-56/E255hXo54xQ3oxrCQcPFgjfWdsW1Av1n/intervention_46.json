I had to take a train to a remote location and rent a car to come back, take time off work, and puppy proof my entire home over the past few days. I even took more time off work to have time to bond with my new dog next week. \n\nSpeaking as an experienced dog owner the family does not seem prepared for dog ownership. They had the dog for 3 days before posting her for adoption. Three days! The dog was already exhibiting some poor eating and leash manners that I\u2019ve begun to correct in our short time together. \n\nThe background is the father has the most experience with dogs but has a busy work schedule so the mom will be raising it mostly. The mom strikes me as inconsistent and manipulative. In talking to the father it was the moms idea to get the dog, then decide to post it for adoption, and now she wants to get the dog back.\n\nThe mom is being very emotionally bullying and saying her daughter can\u2019t process the situation. Of course she can\u2019t she\u2019s too young. Why didn\u2019t they think of that before making this decision as parents? Not only giving the dog up but getting it in the first place if they weren\u2019t going to try for longer than 3 days to be parents to the dog! The inconsistency worries me most, what\u2019s stopping them from just giving the dog back away to another family after this? Or worse, raising the dog in a bad environment. I understand their pain but I will experience a similar pain if I give the dog back up. \n\nI already introduced the dog to my whole family last night and spent all night talking with friends about her, thinking of names, and preparing to give the dog a great life. I already feel bonding starting and I don\u2019t want to give the dog back. \n\n**UPDATE**\nThanks for all of the feedback folks! It helped me decide to 100% keep the dog. \n\n[Puppy pics!](https://www.instagram.com/ms_yuki_shiba)\n\nI told the mom my decision and she is still trying hard to get the dog back (appealing to similar emotions as before). I also started documenting the whole paper trail from exchanges, texts, posts, and transaction history (paid her a fee and then some for some of the doggy items she no longer wanted). Appreciate the advice!\n\nThe last thing I still need from her is some of the remaining dogs vet paperwork (didn\u2019t get it upfront because the initial meetup was late at night and I didn\u2019t expect the drama to follow and she said she\u2019ll send them to me.. 100% my fault). Now she is being pretty bitter and demanding I give back some of the dog accessory stuff we didn\u2019t agree on over text. I guess in the family\u2019s haste they gave me extra food and doggy bags and things like that. I\u2019m really over all of this so I offered to meet up and exchange this stuff for the papers. It sounds like that means they are getting a replacement dog? Hope they learn a lesson and treat that dog better!\n\nWill continue updating if more happens but I think so far she\u2019s accepted it unless she pulls something when we meet.\n\n**UPDATE post meeting the family again**\n\nMet the family again and it went about as I expected. The dad was apologetic and explaining the moms behavior away, and I got the certificates (ownership, vaccinations, ACA registration - yay!) and traded them the extra dog items. \n\nHere\u2019s where it got real though - they showed up with another dog! While they were texting me yesterday trying to get the dog back they were on their way back to the breeder to get another one! They then offered to trade me this new dog they got for my dog. I flat out said hell no, and they pushed hard asking why I didn\u2019t even want to look at it, how could I do this, water works etc. I calmly explained their mistakes back to them, wished them luck with the new dog, and left. \n\nI truly hope the family learned a lesson about how painful it was for them (or maybe just their daughter?) to lose one dog so they don\u2019t do it again. I hope they appreciate the new dog and give him a good life. I hope the dad learns to handle the mom better and have a big part in the dogs life. \n\nSo I think I can call this chapter closed. Now it\u2019s back to puppy training! Thanks reddit!\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not returning the adopted dog. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author adopted a dog from a family who had it for only three days before deciding to give it up. The author went through a lot of effort to take the dog, including traveling, taking time off work, and preparing their home. Now, the family is asking for the dog back, and the author is refusing.\n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if the adoption was formal with a contract, the author might have an obligation to return the dog. But from the post, it seems like this was an informal adoption. The family posted the dog for adoption, and there's no mention of a signed agreement. The author paid the family some money for the dog and some items, but there's no indication of a return policy. In such cases, once a transaction is complete, the buyer typically has the right to keep the pet unless there's a prior agreement allowing returns.\n\nEthically, the author argues that the family wasn't ready for dog ownership, the mom was manipulative, and the family might not provide a stable environment. The author has bonded with the dog and is committed to providing a good life. The family, on the other hand, changed their minds quickly, which suggests they might not have considered the long-term responsibility of pet ownership.\n\nThe family's actions\u2014like trying to get the dog back after just three days and then getting another one\u2014show inconsistency and irresponsibility. The author's decision to keep the dog could prevent the dog from being moved around again, which is in the dog's best interest. However, the author might have a moral obligation if there was a verbal agreement to return the dog. The author is holding onto the dog despite the family's emotional appeals, which could be seen as firm but necessary given the family's instability.\n\nIn the updates, the author mentions meeting the family again and the family trying to trade the dog for another one. The author refuses, which seems fair since the family's actions don't justify a trade. The author also keeps the dog's items from the family, which might be a point of contention, but since the family didn't agree to return those items, the author is in the right to keep them until they receive the paperwork.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions appear justified. They invested time and resources, the family wasn't prepared, and the author is acting in the dog's best interest. The legal ambiguity leans toward the author since there's no formal contract. Ethically, the family's inconsistency and the author's commitment make the author's position stronger. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
