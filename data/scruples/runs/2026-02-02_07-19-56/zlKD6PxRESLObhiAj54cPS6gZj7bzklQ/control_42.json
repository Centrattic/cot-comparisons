We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister over her defense of their guilty sister.\n\nFirst, let's outline the situation. The author's older sister, Jane, is guilty of fraud and has a history of immoral behavior. The younger sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who is representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty but is instead focusing on winning the case, even if Jane is clearly guilty. The author confronts Amy, and when Amy refuses to change her approach, the author threatens to cut contact and does so.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Amy, as a defense attorney, has a professional duty to provide the best defense for her client, regardless of the client's guilt. This is a cornerstone of the legal system\u2014ensuring that everyone gets a fair trial. Even if Jane is guilty, Amy's role is to challenge the prosecution's case and make sure there's no wrongful conviction. The author seems to believe that Amy should use her position to ensure Jane gets punished, which conflicts with the attorney's ethical obligations. \n\nThe author's anger stems from personal feelings about Jane's actions and the belief that Amy is enabling her. However, Amy is doing her job by defending her client. The author is upset because Amy isn't taking a moral stance, but from a professional standpoint, Amy is correct in her approach. The author's threat to cut off contact is a personal decision based on differing values. \n\nThe key points here are the role of a defense attorney and the boundaries between personal relationships and professional ethics. The author isn't wrong for having strong feelings about Jane's guilt or Amy's actions, but cutting off a sister over professional duties might not be justified. However, the author is also within their right to make personal decisions about their relationships. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions are a personal choice. Amy is fulfilling her professional duties, so the author's reaction, while possibly harsh, isn't necessarily wrong because they're dealing with personal and emotional factors. The question is more about differing values rather than a clear ethical breach by the author. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
