We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about cutting off their sister Amy because she's defending their other sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty but is instead trying to get her off.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: They believe Jane is guilty and want her to face consequences. They feel Amy is being unethical by defending her so aggressively, even though Amy is doing it pro bono. The author is cutting ties because they think Amy is compromising her integrity for success or competition.\n\nNow, are they in the wrong? Well, Amy is a defense attorney, and her job is to defend her client, regardless of guilt. The author might not agree with Amy's approach, but as a defense attorney, Amy's role is to provide the best defense possible. The author's expectation that Amy should try to prove Jane guilty is actually against her professional duty. Attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, not act as prosecutors.\n\nThe author's decision to cut contact is their choice, but is it wrong? Maybe not. They have the right to set boundaries based on their values. However, the author might be projecting their own judgment onto Amy's professional role. They might not fully understand the ethical obligations of a defense attorney versus a prosecutor. The author is upset because Amy is prioritizing her career and maybe a challenging case, but that's her choice as an attorney.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for cutting ties because they have the right to be upset and make personal decisions about relationships. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether the author had the right to expect Amy to act beyond her professional duty. Since Amy is doing her job, the author's anger might be misplaced. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting contact, but they might have a misunderstanding about Amy's role. The answer is B (No).\n"
