We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation is that their sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud, and their other sister, Amy, is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to convict Jane even though they all know she's guilty. They ended up cutting contact because Amy refused to \"do the right thing\" in their eyes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author believes Jane is guilty and wants her to face consequences. Amy, as an attorney, has a professional duty to defend her client, regardless of guilt. The author is frustrated that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt, but actually, a defense attorney's job is to get the best possible outcome for their client, which might not necessarily mean proving innocence. They might aim to reduce charges, get a lighter sentence, or secure a plea deal.\n\nThe author is cutting contact because Amy is doing her job, which is to defend Jane. But is this the author's place to demand? They're family, but Amy's professional ethics might take precedence. The author might feel wronged because they think Amy should prioritize family morals over her career, but Amy could see her role as an attorney as separate from her family dynamics.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that everyone knows Jane is guilty, but legally, the burden of proof is on the prosecution. If there's insufficient evidence, Amy's job is to exploit that to the best of her ability. The author's frustration might stem from a misunderstanding of her role as a defense attorney.\n\nNow, considering the AITA aspect, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off Amy. The key points are: the author's right to be upset, Amy's professional obligations, and whether cutting contact is justified. If the author is enforcing their moral stance over Amy's professional duties, they might not be in the wrong from their perspective. However, Amy is doing her job, and the author might be overstepping by pressuring her to act against her professional role.\n\nIn the end, the author's decision to cut contact is a personal choice based on their values. But Amy's actions are within her professional rights. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for cutting contact, but they might be misunderstanding Amy's role. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they're acting on their moral beliefs, even if they misinterpret Amy's actions.\n"
