We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for cutting off their sister Amy because of her actions as an attorney. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. Another sister, Amy, a criminal defense attorney, is representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane even though they all know Jane is guilty. The author thinks Amy should be trying to prove her guilt or at least get her some punishment, but Amy is focused on winning, not justice. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong by cutting off Amy. On one hand, Amy is doing her job as an attorney, which is to defend her client to the best of her ability. The author is upset because they believe Amy isn't being ethical, but in the legal profession, attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients regardless of guilt. The author's decision to cut contact might be seen as overstepping because Amy is within her professional rights to defend Jane.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable, especially given Jane's history. However, using family relationships as leverage to influence a legal professional's conduct is problematic. The author is essentially pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties, which isn't appropriate. Amy's role is separate from her family ties, and the author's threat to cut contact could be seen as holding Amy accountable for her professional decisions, which might not be justified.\n\nAlso, considering Amy's perspective, she's trying to advance her career and gain respect in a competitive environment. The author's criticism about her methods might be valid in terms of personal ethics, but legally, she's doing her job correctly. The author's main issue is with Amy's approach, but the author doesn't have the authority to dictate how Amy handles her cases.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions\u2014threatening to cut contact over professional conduct\u2014could be seen as wrong because they're interfering with Amy's professional responsibilities. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
