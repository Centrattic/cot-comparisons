We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The author is close to Amy, their younger sister who is a defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro bono, even though everyone knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is defending her aggressively, even wanting to win regardless of ethics. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing, which leads to a fight.\n\nNow, the key points: The author is cutting contact over Amy's professional decisions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, Amy is doing her job as an attorney. Her role is to defend her client, regardless of guilt. It's part of the legal system that defense attorneys do their best to protect the rights of the accused. Ethically, lawyers are supposed to zealously represent their clients within the bounds of the law. So Amy might be doing her job by trying to get the best outcome for Jane, even if Jane is guilty. The author disapproves because they believe Jane is guilty and want her to face consequences. However, Amy's actions are within her professional duty.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels betrayed because Amy isn't taking their side. The author might feel that Amy is being unethical by defending someone they know is guilty. But in reality, attorneys can't be biased based on their personal knowledge of guilt; their job is to follow the evidence and legal procedures. The author's threat to cut off contact is a personal decision, but does that make them wrong?\n\nAnother angle: Family dynamics. The author and Amy have a strained relationship with Jane. The author is upset that Amy is using her position to help someone they all consider morally wrong. But Amy's decision to take the case might be about her career and proving herself in a male-dominated field, as she mentions. The author is imposing their moral judgment on a professional decision.\n\nIs the author wrong for cutting contact? The author believes Amy is acting unethically, but legally and professionally, Amy is within her rights. Cutting off a sibling is a personal choice. However, the author might be overstepping by dictating how Amy should perform her job. Amy's actions are her professional responsibility, and the author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her career choices. \n\nBut the author might feel strongly that Amy is complicit in Jane's wrongdoing by defending her. However, the legal system requires defense attorneys to do that, even if they know the client is guilty. The author's moral stance is personal and doesn't align with legal ethics. Therefore, the author's decision to cut off Amy might be based on a misunderstanding of professional obligations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong for feeling hurt and making a personal decision about their relationship, but the root issue is that they are holding Amy accountable for her professional conduct, which is her own choice. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Amy is acting within her professional role, the author's anger might be misplaced. The answer would be that the author is not in the wrong for their actions, but their reasoning might be flawed. Wait, the options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions (cutting off Amy) are justified. Since Amy is fulfilling her professional duties, the author's disapproval is based on a personal moral conflict. However, the author is within their rights to make decisions about their relationships. So the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
