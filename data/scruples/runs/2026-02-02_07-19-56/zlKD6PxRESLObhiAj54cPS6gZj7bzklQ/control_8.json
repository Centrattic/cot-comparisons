We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who cut off their sister over her legal choices is in the wrong. So, the main issue is whether the author's decision to cut contact with Amy, their sister who's an attorney, was justified.\n\nFirst, the context: the author's older sister Jane committed fraud, and the younger sister Amy is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and is instead defending her to win, which the author sees as unethical. The author threatened to cut contact if Amy didn't act \"rightly,\" and Amy then cut them off.\n\nThe key points here are the ethical obligations of an attorney versus the personal feelings of the family. As an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to prove their guilt. Even if the client is guilty, the attorney's role is to ensure the legal system works properly, protecting against wrongful convictions. The author seems to misunderstand this role, thinking Amy should act as a prosecutor instead.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given Jane's history, but pressuring a lawyer to act against their professional duties is problematic. The author's statement that they would cut contact if Amy didn't do the \"right thing\" is where the issue lies. This puts Amy in a conflict of interest between her duty as an attorney and her family loyalty.\n\nAmy, on the other hand, is following her professional obligations. She's defending Jane not because she believes she's innocent, but to ensure the legal process is followed. The author is criticizing her for doing her job correctly, which is a fundamental part of the legal system.\n\nHowever, the author's decision to cut contact might stem from a place of moral judgment, but it's important to recognize that Amy isn't ethically required to act as an investigator or prosecutor. The author's threat to cut ties over this professional choice could be seen as inconsiderate of Amy's role and the boundaries of her profession.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are not clearly in the wrong, but there's a nuance. The author is upset about Amy's professional choices, but Amy is just doing her job. The author's cutting off contact might be harsh, but it's based on their personal values and family dynamics. However, the core issue is whether the author's actions are justified given that Amy is fulfilling her legal duties. Since the author is not in the wrong for having those feelings, but the answer hinges on whether their decision to cut contact is morally wrong. Given that Amy is acting within her professional role, the author's stance might be overly critical, but it's not entirely their fault. The answer is B (No).\n"
