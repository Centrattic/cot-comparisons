We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister due to her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's older sister was arrested for fraud, and the younger sister (the author's sister, Amy) is a defense attorney who is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset because Amy is defending a clearly guilty sister, even though both the author and Amy know Jane is guilty. The author wants Amy to act in the right way, maybe to secure a guilty verdict, but Amy is focused on winning, possibly to build her reputation, and the author threatens to cut off contact if she doesn't. They had a conflict, and now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's values vs. Amy's professional choices. The author feels Amy is being unethical by defending someone they both know is guilty, using the case to boost her career. The author's reaction is cutting off Amy if she doesn't act \"rightly.\" \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about ethics and family dynamics. Legally, as an attorney, Amy's job is to provide the best defense for her client, regardless of their guilt. It's part of the legal system's adversarial process. So, even if the client is guilty, the attorney must defend them zealously. That's the principle of the legal profession. The author might not understand that, thinking Amy is being unethical, but actually, Amy is just doing her job. \n\nHowever, the author is upset because of personal feelings and the sister's guilt. The author's demand that Amy act in a certain way professionally may be unrealistic. The author is threatening to cut off contact over this, which is a personal choice, but is it wrong? Well, the author is within their rights to end a relationship with family members. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nThe moral angle here is complex. The author believes that Amy is complicit in Jane's wrongdoing by defending her instead of ensuring she gets the consequences. But legally, Amy isn't complicit; she's upholding her professional duties. The author's frustration stems from personal feelings and the belief that Amy is being unethical, but legally and professionally, Amy is within her rights. \n\nSo, the author's actions (cutting off Amy) are a personal choice based on their values, but they may not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to distance themselves from a sister who's making decisions they morally disagree with, even if those decisions are legally and professionally justified.\n"
