We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their other sister, Amy, who is a defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but instead wants to win at any cost. The author threatened to cut contact if Amy didn't \"do the right thing,\" and Amy got angry. Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo the key points here are the author's justification for cutting off Amy. The author feels that Amy's actions are unethical and that she's helping a guilty person avoid punishment. The author's moral stance is that Amy should ensure Jane is convicted, but Amy, as a professional, is doing her job to defend her client, even if she believes the client is guilty.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. As a defense attorney, Amy's role is to provide the best possible defense for her client, regardless of her personal belief in the client's guilt. This is a fundamental principle in the legal system\u2014it's about ensuring fair trials and protecting the rights of the accused. The author is criticizing Amy for not trying to prove Jane guilty, which might not be her role. Attorneys can't ethically try to secure a conviction if they believe the client is guilty unless there's a confession or sufficient evidence. However, Amy's job is to challenge the prosecution's case and ensure that the state meets the burden of proof. If there's insufficient evidence, the correct outcome is an acquittal, which is part of the justice system's design to prevent wrongful convictions.\n\nThe author's threat to cut contact is based on their moral judgment of Amy's professional conduct. However, Amy is acting within her professional duties. The author might be conflating personal morality with professional ethics. The legal system allows for this separation, where attorneys can take on clients they believe are guilty but still provide a robust defense. The author's frustration stems from their relationship with Jane and their belief in her guilt, but Amy's actions are within her professional role.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel betrayed because Amy isn't aligning with their personal moral stance. But Amy has her own career goals and ethical obligations as a lawyer. The author's decision to cut off their sister could be seen as imposing their personal ethics on Amy's professional life, which might not be fair. However, the author is also within their rights to prioritize their values and set boundaries in their personal relationships.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from the legal and professional standpoint, Amy is doing her job. The author's actions are a personal choice based on their values. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether one prioritizes professional ethics over personal relationships. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling hurt or for setting boundaries, but they might be misunderstanding the role of a defense attorney. The question is whether cutting off a family member is a proportional response to Amy's professional decisions. Some might argue that the author is overreacting, while others might see it as a justified stance given their personal relationship with Jane.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on the distinction between personal ethics and professional duties. The author isn't in the wrong for having their own moral stance, but they might be missing the broader context of Amy's role as an attorney. The right or wrong here isn't absolute, but from the given information, the author's actions stem from their personal beliefs, which aren't inherently wrong, but they could be causing unnecessary conflict.\n"
