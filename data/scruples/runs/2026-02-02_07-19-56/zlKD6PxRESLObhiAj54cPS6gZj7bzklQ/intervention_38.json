We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The author is close to Amy, their other sister, who is a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane pro bono. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty and that Amy is defending her not to prove innocence but to win, even if that means getting her a lighter sentence. The author confronts Amy about this, and when Amy refuses to try to prove Jane's guilt, the author threatens to cut off contact. Amy gets angry, and the author is now wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's moral stance against Jane's guilt, the role of Amy as a defense attorney, and the ethical obligations of an attorney. \n\nI know that in legal ethics, attorneys have a duty to zealously represent their clients, regardless of the client's guilt. That's a fundamental part of the justice system. So Amy is doing her job by trying to get the best possible outcome for Jane, even if she believes Jane is guilty. The author is upset because they think Amy should be trying to ensure Jane faces consequences, but that's not how the legal system works. The author is using their personal morals to push Amy to act against her professional duties, which is a conflict of interest.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014threatening to cut contact if Amy doesn't act a certain way\u2014might be seen as pressuring her to breach her professional ethics. That's not appropriate. The author is imposing their personal judgment on Amy's professional role. Even if the author is morally opposed to Jane's actions, they can't dictate how Amy handles her legal responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author feels betrayed because they see Amy choosing her career over family morals. But Amy's profession requires her to advocate for her client, not to judge them. The author's threat to cut off contact is a personal decision, but whether they're in the wrong depends on whether they interfered improperly with Amy's professional duties.\n\nSince the author is pressuring Amy to act against her professional obligations, which are legally protected, the author might be in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author has the right to distance themselves from Amy's choices. But in the context of the question, the focus is on whether the author is at fault for cutting contact due to Amy's job performance. The answer likely hinges on understanding the attorney's duty versus the family member's feelings.\n"
