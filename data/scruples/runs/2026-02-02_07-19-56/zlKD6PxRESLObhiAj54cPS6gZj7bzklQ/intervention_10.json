We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author cut off their sister because she's defending their guilty sister pro bono without trying to prove her guilty. The author is upset because Amy, the younger sister, is an attorney and is defending Jane, who's clearly guilty in their eyes. The author wanted Amy to help secure a guilty verdict but she's choosing to represent Jane in a way they see as unethical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. As an attorney, Amy's job is to provide the best defense possible for her client, regardless of whether she believes the client is guilty or not. The principle of zealous representation is key here. Even if a defense attorney believes the client is guilty, their role is to ensure the prosecution has to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. So Amy might be doing her job correctly by not focusing on proving guilt but on challenging the prosecution's evidence.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author feels betrayed because Amy isn't helping them get justice by ensuring Jane faces consequences. The author's frustration stems from a personal moral standpoint, thinking Amy is being unethical. However, from a professional standpoint, Amy is doing her job. The author's threat to cut off Amy could be seen as a personal decision based on their values, but it's not necessarily wrong for the author to feel that way. However, cutting off a sister over professional ethical boundaries might be extreme.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's actions are a personal choice. They can choose their relationships and their boundaries. But Amy is doing her job, which is legally appropriate. The author might be conflating personal morality with professional ethics. The author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by cutting off Amy. So technically, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe they could have handled it differently without cutting off their sister. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy. Since their action is a personal boundary, even if it's hurtful, it's not inherently their fault. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
