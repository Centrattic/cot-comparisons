We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation step by step. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and the younger sister Amy, a criminal defense attorney, is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty and they think Amy isn't doing her job to prove guilt. They had a heated argument where the author threatened to cut contact if Amy didn't act in what they see as the \"right\" way, which led to Amy getting angry and the author cutting her off.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the ethical responsibilities of an attorney versus personal feelings. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. This is a fundamental part of the legal system\u2014attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients within the bounds of the law, even if they personally believe the client is guilty. The author is frustrated because Amy isn't trying to secure a conviction; instead, she's focusing on winning the case, which is her professional duty.\n\nThe author's main issue is that they believe Amy should be helping to ensure Jane is convicted, given that they all agree Jane is guilty. However, from a legal ethics standpoint, Amy is correct in her approach. The legal system doesn't allow personal convictions about guilt to influence the defense. The author is trying to interfere with Amy's professional judgment, which is inappropriate. By threatening to cut off Amy if she doesn't act in a certain way, the author is essentially pressuring her to violate her professional ethics. That's a problem because it undermines the attorney-client relationship and the integrity of the legal process.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable given the context of Jane's past behavior and the family dynamics. But the author's actions\u2014threatening to cut off a family member over such a matter\u2014could be seen as harsh. However, whether the author is \"in the wrong\" depends on whether their actions were justified. Since Amy is acting within her professional role, the author is not wrong in being upset about her approach. But cutting off a sibling is a severe action, and the author might have overreacted, especially if they didn't consider the legal system's requirements.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether pressuring a family member who's acting within their professional duties is wrong. From a legal perspective, Amy is doing her job correctly, so the author is not in the right to demand she act otherwise. However, family dynamics are different. The author might feel hurt or betrayed, but that doesn't mean they're in the wrong for their emotional response. However, the act of cutting someone off based on their professional decisions might be seen as overstepping, especially if it's not a matter of direct harm but of ethical disagreement.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions may be seen as a personal choice, but the act of cutting off a sibling over professional ethics might not make them \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense, but they did not consider the professional boundaries Amy has to uphold. However, the core issue is that Amy is acting within her job, so the author is not wrong for their feelings but might be wrong in pressuring her to act against her professional duties. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off contact. Since Amy is doing her job correctly, the author's actions could be seen as overreaching, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
