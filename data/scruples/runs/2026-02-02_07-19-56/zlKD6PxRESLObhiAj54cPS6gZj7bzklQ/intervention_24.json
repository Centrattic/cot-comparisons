We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person whose sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their other sister, Amy, who is a defense attorney representing Jane. The author feels that Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but is instead trying to win the case regardless of Jane's guilt. The author threatens to cut off contact with Amy if she doesn't \"do the right thing,\" leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is with Amy's professional decisions. The author believes Amy should ensure Jane is punished for her crimes. But Amy, as a defense attorney, has an ethical obligation to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. This is a fundamental principle in the legal system\u2014attorneys must defend clients zealously, even if they know the client is guilty. So, maybe the author is misunderstanding Amy's role here.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is understandable given the family context and their personal feelings about Jane. The author feels that Amy is enabling Jane's behavior by not seeking justice. But the line between personal ethics and professional duty is important here. Amy's job isn't to make Jane suffer but to provide a fair defense. The author might be conflating Amy's role as a defense attorney with a personal moral stance.\n\nThe author's threat to cut contact is a significant point. While the author has the right to set boundaries in their relationships, using the threat of cutting off contact based on Amy's professional decisions might be seen as manipulative or unfair, especially if Amy is fulfilling her legal duties. The author's actions could be seen as pressuring Amy to act against her professional ethics, which is not appropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's approach might be seen as exploiting the legal system for personal gain or career advancement, but as a defense attorney, her job is to win cases, not to determine guilt. The author's perspective is that Amy is being unethical, but in reality, Amy is doing her job. The author's anger might stem from a moral conflict between their personal feelings and the legal system's requirements.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong in feeling hurt or frustrated, but they might be misunderstanding Amy's role as an attorney. The author's response, threatening to cut contact Amy for doing her job, could be seen as wrong because it's pressuring her to act outside of her professional ethics. Hence, the author's actions, while understandable, are not justified if they interfere with Amy's professional responsibilities.\n"
