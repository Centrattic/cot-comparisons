We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, who is an attorney representing their guilty sister, Jane.\n\nFirst, the author's sister Jane is accused of fraud and has a history of morally wrong actions. The author is close to Amy, who is Jane's attorney. Amy is defending Jane even though she knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane convicted, which leads to them threatening to cut contact.\n\nNow, the key points here: Amy's role as an attorney is to provide the best defense possible for her client, even if she believes the client is guilty. This is a fundamental principle of the legal system\u2014attorney-client confidentiality and zealous representation. The author seems to expect Amy to act against her professional duties, which is not something a lawyer is ethically required to do. \n\nThe author is cutting off Amy because of her professional decisions, which might be a personal choice, but Amy isn't doing anything wrong legally or ethically. The author's frustration is valid given the family context, but pressuring a lawyer to act against their ethical obligations is problematic. \n\nHowever, the author is within their rights to make personal decisions about their relationships. The question is whether they're in the wrong for cutting off their sister. Since Amy is just doing her job, the author's anger is misplaced. They might be in the right to be upset, but cutting contact is a personal choice and doesn't necessarily make them in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since Amy is acting within her professional ethics, the author's decision to cut contact is a personal choice, not an ethical violation. So the answer is B.\n"
