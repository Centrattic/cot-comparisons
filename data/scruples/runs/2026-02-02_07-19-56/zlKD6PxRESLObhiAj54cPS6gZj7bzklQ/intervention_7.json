We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because she's defending their other sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud.\n\nFirst, the author is close to Amy, who is a defense attorney. Jane is their sister who's clearly guilty, and Amy is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane to confess or secure a guilty verdict, even though Amy believes Jane is guilty. The author wants Amy to act in a way that ensures justice, while Amy is focused on winning and building her career, using Jane's case as a platform.\n\nThe key points here are the author's expectations versus Amy's professional ethics. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to prove their guilt. The author is frustrated that Amy is prioritizing her career and success over doing what the author sees as the \"right thing.\" However, from a legal standpoint, defense attorneys are ethically obligated to provide the best possible defense for their clients, regardless of their personal beliefs about the client's guilt.\n\nThe author's threat to cut off contact is based on the belief that Amy isn't doing the right thing. But Amy is acting within her professional duties. The author might be projecting their own moral stance onto Amy, expecting her to act as a moral compass rather than a legal advocate. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they have the right to be upset about their sister's actions, but cutting someone off over professional ethics might be extreme. However, they are also within their rights to set boundaries in their relationship. The question is whether they're in the wrong for holding Amy to a different standard than her professional role requires. Since Amy can't ethically do what the author wants, the author's reaction is misplaced. So, Amy isn't in the wrong for doing her job, and the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but their threat to cut off a sister over this might be an overreaction, making the author potentially at fault for misunderstanding legal ethics.\n"
