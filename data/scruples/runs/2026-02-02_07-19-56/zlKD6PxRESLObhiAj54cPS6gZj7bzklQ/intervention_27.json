We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister, Jane, who's been arrested for fraud, and their other sister, Amy, who is Jane's defense attorney. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is defending her, even when they all know Jane is guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author believes Jane is guilty and wants her to face consequences. Amy, as Jane's attorney, is doing her job by defending her client, even if she believes Jane is guilty. The author feels Amy is being unethical, using the case to gain notoriety or success, and cutting ties with the family over it.\n\nThe main issue here is the role of an attorney. In the legal system, defense attorneys are supposed to provide the best possible defense for their client, regardless of their personal beliefs about the client's guilt. Their duty is to the client, not to the truth. So Amy is technically doing her job correctly by defending Jane, even if she thinks Jane is guilty. The author is upset because they think Amy should be trying to get Jane convicted, but that's not how the adversarial system works.\n\nHowever, the author is cutting off their sister Amy for doing her job. That seems harsh. Even if the author disagrees with Amy's approach, Amy has a professional obligation to her client. The author's threat to cut contact because Amy is doing her job might be seen as overreacting. The author is prioritizing their own moral stance over allowing Amy to fulfill her professional duties. \n\nBut there's also a family dynamic here. The author might feel betrayed because Amy is defending someone they all consider guilty. Amy's competitive nature and desire for success could be exacerbating the situation, but the author's response is to cut off contact, which is a significant step. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're not wrong in their feelings\u2014they have the right to be upset. However, cutting off a sister because she's doing her job as an attorney, even if they disagree with her tactics, might be seen as unreasonable. The legal system relies on defense attorneys to challenge the prosecution, so Amy's actions are within professional ethics. The author's threat to cut contact might be the overreaction here. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're not ethically wrong for feeling that way, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, based on the options given, the answer would be B because the author isn't in the wrong for their actions, even if they could be handled differently. Alternatively, maybe A, if the author is wrong to cut contact over a professional disagreement. Wait, but Amy is acting within her professional role. The author's problem is that they expect their sister to act against professional ethics. So, the author is not in the wrong for their feelings, but maybe in the wrong for cutting off contact. Hmm, the options are A or B. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A), but maybe the correct answer is B because the author isn't in the wrong for their actions. Or perhaps the author is in the wrong for cutting contact because Amy is just doing her job. \n\nThis is tricky. In the legal system, the defense attorney's job is to defend the client regardless of guilt. So Amy is correct in her approach. The author is upset because they want Amy to act against her professional duties. Therefore, the author is wrong to cut off Amy for doing her job. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) if the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting contact. Wait, no\u2014wait the options are A for yes (author is in the wrong) and B for no (author not in the wrong). If the author is wrong to cut contact, then answer A. If the author is not wrong, answer B. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are appropriate. Since Amy is doing her job, the author is cutting contact because of a professional disagreement. The author might not be in the wrong in their feelings, but maybe the action of cutting contact is excessive. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is that the author is wrong to cut off Amy, then A. If the author isn't wrong, then B. \n\nIn the AITA context, sometimes the answer is that the person isn't in the wrong if their actions are justified. But in this case, Amy is acting professionally, so maybe the author is wrong to cut contact. However, the author's reasoning is that they think Amy is unethical. But Amy is following ethical guidelines. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting contact. So answer A.\n"
