We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics, legal ethics, and personal relationships.\n\nFirst, the author has a sister, Jane, who's been arrested for fraud. The author is close to their other sister, Amy, who's an attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro bono, despite everyone knowing Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is focusing on winning the case, even if Jane is probably guilty. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't do the \"right\" thing, leading to a heated argument.\n\nNow, considering legal ethics: as an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane, to provide the best defense possible. Even if the client is guilty, the attorney's role isn't to seek guilt but to ensure the justice system works properly. Attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients within the bounds of the law. So Amy's actions are within her professional responsibilities. The author is upset because they expect Amy to act more like a family member than an attorney, which might not be fair.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they feel betrayed because they believe Amy should be helping to ensure Jane faces consequences, given Jane's history. But Amy is doing her job as an attorney, which is to defend her client. The author might not understand the legal system's adversarial nature, where the prosecution must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Amy's job isn't to prove guilt but to challenge the prosecution's case, which is her ethical duty.\n\nConflict arises from differing roles. The author sees Amy as a sister first, expecting her to prioritize family morals, while Amy is in a professional role where her duty is to her client. The author cutting off contact is a personal decision based on their values, but Amy isn't wrong for doing her job. The author might be in the wrong for pressuring Amy to act against her professional obligations.\n\nHowever, Amy's attitude about representing someone like Jane for success might be ethically questionable in terms of her motivations, but as long as she's adhering to legal standards, she's not in the wrong. The author's reaction could be seen as not respecting Amy's professional role, even though they have personal feelings about Jane's guilt. The question is whether the author's actions (threatening to cut off contact) are justified.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often looks at whether the person acted with reasonable judgment. Here, the author is upset about their sister's actions as an attorney, but Amy is fulfilling her professional duties. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's role as an attorney and overstepping by threatening to cut her off. However, the author's feelings about Jane's guilt and Amy's role in potentially letting her off the hook could be seen as a personal conflict.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Amy is doing her job as an attorney, 2) The author is pressuring her to act against professional ethics, 3) The author's reaction is emotional and possibly not considering legal standards.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the attorney's role and overreacting. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. If the author is upset because Amy is not trying to prove Jane's guilt, but Amy is doing her job, then the author is not in the wrong for feeling that way. However, cutting off a sister over this could be seen as extreme. The community might say that the author is not in the wrong because they have a moral stance, but Amy is doing her job. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the attorney-client relationship. Hmm. This is tricky. The AITA community often considers intent and reasonableness. The author's intent is to hold Jane accountable, but Amy's job is to defend her. The author's action (threatening to cut off contact) is a personal choice, but Amy isn't wrong for doing her job. So maybe the answer is B (author not in the wrong), but some might argue that the author is overstepping. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are a personal decision based on their values, and while they might not consider the legal role, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. But maybe they are in the wrong for pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties. Wait, the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong. If the author is not in the wrong, answer B. If they are in the wrong, answer A. The key is whether the author's actions (threatening to cut off Amy) are justified. The author's justification is that Amy is not doing the \"right\" thing by defending Jane. But Amy is doing her job. So the author's actions might be seen as unreasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong? Or are they? It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might be B because the author is acting on their moral beliefs, even if they don't understand the legal role. Alternatively, A if they're overstepping. The AITA community often sides with understanding roles. So Amy is doing her job, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but their action of cutting off contact might be seen as extreme. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy. In the scenario, the author says they would cut off contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing. If Amy is doing her job, then the author's action is not based on wrongdoings by Amy but on her professional role. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for having those feelings, but maybe their action is extreme. However, the answer options are A or B. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the author isn't necessarily wrong for having those feelings, even if their action is extreme, the answer is B.\n"
