We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author has a sister, Jane, who was arrested for fraud. They have a strained relationship, and Jane has a history of immoral behavior. The younger sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who's representing Jane pro-bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, even though they all believe Jane is guilty. The author confronts Amy, leading to a conflict where the author threatens to cut off contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing.\" Amy gets mad and leaves. The author now asks if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. As a defense attorney, Amy's role is to defend her client, regardless of her personal belief in the client's guilt. This is a fundamental part of the legal system\u2014every person is presumed innocent until proven guilty, and the defense's job is to ensure justice is served, not to secure a conviction. So Amy is doing her job by providing the best defense possible for Jane, even if she thinks Jane is guilty.\n\nThe author is upset because they believe Amy should ensure Jane gets punished. However, the legal system isn't about punishing the guilty but about protecting the innocent and ensuring fair trials. Amy is following her professional duty, and the author's expectation that she act against her role as a defense attorney is problematic. The author's threat to cut contact is based on a misunderstanding of Amy's professional obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach of threatening to cut off a family member over this situation is harsh. While the author is frustrated with Jane's behavior and Amy's approach, using family relationships as leverage is a strong move. It's possible that the author is projecting their own feelings about Jane onto Amy, expecting her to act in a way that aligns with their moral stance, which isn't fair given Amy's profession.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's decision to defend Jane despite her guilt might be seen as unethical by the author, but in reality, it's a necessary part of the adversarial legal system. Lawyers are supposed to represent clients zealously, even if they believe them guilty. The author's criticism may not account for the legal principles at play here.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions\u2014threatening to cut contact and pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties\u2014are not justified. The author is in the wrong because they're not respecting Amy's role as a defense attorney and are using familial pressure to influence her professional decisions.\n"
