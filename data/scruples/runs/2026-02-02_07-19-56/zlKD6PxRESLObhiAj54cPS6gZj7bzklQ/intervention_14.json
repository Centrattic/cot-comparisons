We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's sister, Jane, is on trial for fraud and the author believes she's guilty. Amy, the other sister, is Jane's defense attorney and is representing her pro bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty but instead is focused on winning the case, even if that means getting Jane off. The author threatened to cut off contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing,\" which led to a confrontation where Amy left angry.\n\nSo, the main points here: The author is cutting off Amy because she's defending Jane, not trying to convict her. The author thinks Amy should be trying to prove Jane guilty, but Amy is doing her job as a defense attorney, which is to defend her client, not seek justice in the author's eyes. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to provide the best possible defense for her client, regardless of the client's guilt or the attorney's personal feelings. The justice system is supposed to protect the rights of the accused, even if they're guilty. So Amy is doing her job by ensuring that Jane gets a fair trial and that the prosecution meets the burden of proof. If there's not enough evidence, then the correct legal outcome is an acquittal, which is what Amy is aiming for.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel Amy is helping someone guilty get away with it, but that's a misunderstanding of the attorney's role. The author is imposing their own moral judgment on Amy's professional duty. By threatening to cut contact, the author is punishing Amy for doing her job as a defense attorney. That seems unfair because Amy is fulfilling her professional responsibilities, even if the family disapproves of her client's actions.\n\nAdditionally, the author's stance that Amy should be helping the prosecution might be legally unethical. A defense attorney isn't supposed to cooperate with the prosecution against the client's interests. So the author's expectations are misaligned with legal ethics.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's behavior in wanting to represent a high-profile case like Jane's, perhaps to gain notoriety, might be seen as unprofessional, but that's between her and her professional conduct. However, the author's response of cutting off contact is a personal decision based on their moral stance.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're expecting Amy to act against her professional duties and personal career goals, which she's within her rights to do. The author's threat to cut off family ties is an overreaction to Amy's professional conduct.\n"
