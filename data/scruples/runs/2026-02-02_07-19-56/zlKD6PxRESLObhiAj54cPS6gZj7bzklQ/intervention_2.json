We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their younger sister Amy, who's a defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro-bono, even though everyone knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty but instead wants to win at all costs, even if it means helping Jane avoid punishment. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't do the \"right thing,\" leading to a heated argument.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off Amy. Let's break down the key points. \n\nThe author's perspective: They believe Jane is guilty and that Amy should act according to that belief. They think Amy's approach is unethical and could harm her career. The author feels that Amy is prioritizing her own success and challenging the legal system's fairness by defending someone they know is guilty.\n\nAmy's perspective: As an attorney, she has a professional duty to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of her personal beliefs about the client's guilt. She's in a competitive field and may see this as an opportunity to prove herself, especially as a woman. She might be following ethical guidelines that require her to zealously represent her client.\n\nLegal ethics are important here. Attorneys are supposed to provide a vigorous defense, even if they think the client is guilty. This is part of the justice system's design to ensure fair trials. If Amy is doing her job correctly, the author's expectations might be unrealistic. However, the author is frustrated because they see Amy as being complicit in Jane's actions.\n\nThe author's threat to cut contact is based on moral judgment of Amy's professional choices. But Amy's job requires her to be neutral and not allow personal feelings to affect her work. The author might be conflating personal relationships with professional duties. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If Amy is fulfilling her professional responsibilities, then the author's anger may be misplaced. The author is upset about Amy's approach, but that's part of Amy's job. Cutting off a family member over professional ethics could be seen as extreme, especially if Amy isn't breaking any rules.\n\nHowever, the author might feel personally betrayed because Amy is helping a sister they already have a strained relationship with. The emotional aspect is significant here. But legally and ethically, Amy's actions might be justified. The author's decision to cut off Amy is based on personal moral beliefs conflicting with professional ethics. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in their own eyes, but from an objective standpoint, they might be misunderstanding Amy's role as an attorney. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because they are acting based on their moral stance, even if Amy is just doing her job.\n"
