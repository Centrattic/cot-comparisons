We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's older sister Jane was arrested for fraud. Their younger sister Amy, a criminal defense attorney, is representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy is not trying to prove Jane guilty, even though they both believe she is. The author confronts Amy, and when Amy says she's going to win the case regardless of Jane's guilt, the author threatens to cut contact. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The author's moral judgment of Jane and her actions. 2) The ethical duty of Amy as an attorney. 3) The author's decision to cut off contact based on Amy's professional choices.\n\nIn the US legal system, attorneys have a duty to zealously represent their clients, regardless of personal beliefs about the client's guilt. This is a fundamental principle of the legal profession. Amy is doing her job by ensuring Jane gets a fair defense, even if Jane is guilty. The author might not understand that the role of a defense attorney isn't to prove guilt but to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof.\n\nThe author's issue is with Amy's professional decisions, which are within ethical boundaries. However, the author is cutting off contact over this, which is a personal choice. The question is whether the author is wrong to do so. \n\nOn one hand, the author might feel betrayed because they believe Amy isn't upholding moral standards. On the other hand, Amy is fulfilling her professional responsibilities, which are separate from personal morality. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, as they are imposing their moral standards on Amy's professional duties.\n\nBut then, the author is also cutting off a family member, which is a personal relationship. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If Amy is doing her job, then the author is punishing Amy for professional conduct that's ethically required. However, it's their choice to maintain that relationship, and if they can't reconcile their values, cutting contact is a personal decision, not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting on their moral convictions, even if their understanding of the legal role is flawed. However, others might argue that Amy is doing her job and the author is wrong to cut contact over that. But in this context, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether Amy's actions are right or wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for cutting off contact, as they have the right to set personal boundaries based on their values, even if those values clash with professional ethics.\n"
