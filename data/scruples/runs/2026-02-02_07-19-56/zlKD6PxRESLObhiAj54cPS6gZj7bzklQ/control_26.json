We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Jane, because of her actions and the sister's decision to defend her despite knowing she's guilty.\n\nFirst, the author's sister, Jane, is guilty of fraud and has a history of immoral behavior. The other sister, Amy, is her attorney and is defending her, even though she knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and is instead trying to get her off with community service or nothing. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't do the \"right thing,\" which Amy sees as the author being too nice.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\n1. **Family Relationships**: The author and Jane have a strained relationship. Amy is close to the author but also has her own career. The author is upset that Amy is defending Jane despite knowing her guilt.\n\n2. **Amy's Role as an Attorney**: Amy is an attorney, and her job is to defend her client to the best of her ability. Even if she believes the client is guilty, she's ethically obligated to provide a strong defense. The author is judging Amy for not trying to get Jane to confess or for not making her face consequences. But as an attorney, Amy's role isn't to determine guilt but to ensure the legal process is followed.\n\n3. **Ethical Obligations**: Lawyers have a duty to their clients, not to the public or family members. Amy's decision to defend Jane pro-bono might be for personal reasons, like career advancement or helping her sister. The author is pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties, which might not be fair.\n\n4. **Author's Reaction**: The author threatens to cut off contact with Amy, which is a very serious decision. The question is whether this reaction is justified. The author believes Amy is being unethical, but from a legal standpoint, Amy is doing her job. The author's moral stance might not align with Amy's professional ethics.\n\n5. **Power Dynamics and Personal Biases**: The author sees Jane as guilty and morally bankrupt. Amy might be trying to build her career, and the author is upset that Amy is prioritizing her career over family morals. However, Amy's perspective is that she's doing what's necessary in her profession, even if it's controversial.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong in their personal opinion, but cutting off a family member over a difference in professional ethics could be seen as extreme. Amy is fulfilling her role as an attorney, and the author's reaction could be based on their own values conflicting with Amy's professional judgment. However, the author has the right to set boundaries in their personal relationships, even if it leads to cutting someone off. The key is whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. Since Amy is acting within her professional ethics, the author might be overstepping by pressuring her to act against them. But the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to distance themselves from Jane or for being upset about Amy's choices. It's a complex situation with valid points on both sides. However, the author's right to set personal boundaries is their own, even if it leads to cutting off a sister. So the answer is B.\n"
