We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because Amy is defending their other sister Jane, who is guilty of fraud. The author feels that Amy is helping Jane despite knowing she's guilty, which the author sees as unethical. Amy, on the other hand, is doing her job as an attorney, trying to get the best outcome for Jane regardless of guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. As an attorney, Amy's job is to represent her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. This is a fundamental principle in the legal system. The idea is that everyone deserves a fair trial, even if they're guilty. So from a professional standpoint, Amy is doing her duty.\n\nThen there's the personal relationship. The author is upset because they think Amy is enabling Jane's immoral behavior. They feel betrayed because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, even though Amy herself admits Jane is guilty. The author wants Amy to ensure Jane faces consequences, but Amy is focused on winning the case, which might mean getting a better deal for Jane.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off Amy is based on their moral stance. But is that the author's place to make that decision? Amy is an adult and can choose how to represent her clients. The author might be projecting their own feelings about Jane onto Amy, but Amy's actions are within her professional role.\n\nHowever, the author feels hurt and disillusioned. They might have hoped Amy would prioritize family values over her career. But is it right to cut someone off for choosing their career path? The author's reaction is extreme, but maybe they have a right to feel that Amy isn't taking a moral stance.\n\nOn the flip side, Amy might be justified in her actions because she's doing her job. She's not lying or breaking any rules; she's advocating for her client. The author's pressure could be seen as interfering with her professional responsibilities.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? They are cutting off a sister because of her professional decisions, which are within legal and ethical boundaries. The author's moral judgment might be leading to a harsh response. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), because Amy isn't in the wrong professionally, and the author's actions stem from personal feelings rather than any wrongdoing by Amy.\n"
