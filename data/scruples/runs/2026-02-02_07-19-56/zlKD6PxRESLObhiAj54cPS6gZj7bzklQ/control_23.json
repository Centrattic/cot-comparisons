We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney in their sister Jane's case. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and they believe she's guilty. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who's taking Jane's case pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is focusing on winning the case, even if Jane is likely guilty. The author felt that Amy's approach was unethical and threatened to cut her off if she didn't act the \"right\" way. The sisters had a fight, and Amy left angry.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break down the key points.\n\nThe author's main issue is that Amy is representing someone (Jane) they all agree is guilty but isn't being aggressive about proving her guilt. The author is frustrated that Amy is using the case to prove herself in a competitive field, maybe even to build her reputation. The author believes Amy should focus on justice and not on her own career. They argue that Amy's actions are unethical and that she should be helping to ensure Jane faces consequences, not defend her.\n\nOn the other hand, as a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client. Even if she believes the client is guilty, she has an ethical duty to provide the best defense possible. The legal system allows for this because the burden of proof is on the prosecution. If there's insufficient evidence, the client must be acquitted. So Amy's role isn't to prove guilt but to challenge the prosecution's case, which is her professional obligation.\n\nThe author might not understand the legal system's process. They might expect Amy to act as a prosecutor rather than a defense attorney. The author's frustration could come from feeling that Amy is letting Jane off the hook or not taking her guilt seriously, but in reality, Amy is just doing her job. \n\nHowever, the author is cutting off a family member over this, which is a big decision. The author might feel justified because of their strained relationship with Jane and their closeness to Amy. But they might not realize that Amy's actions are within professional ethics. The author might be projecting their own moral standards onto Amy, expecting her to take a moral stance rather than a professional one.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If cutting off a sister is based on misunderstanding Amy's professional role, then maybe the author is at fault. But if Amy is acting unethically in some way beyond her professional duty (like actively helping Jane in a way that's illegal or unethical), then the author might have a point. \n\nBut according to the story, Amy is just defending Jane to the best of her ability. She hasn't confessed to anything, and the evidence is insufficient. So Amy's job is to ensure Jane gets a fair trial. The author is upset because they want Jane to face consequences, but that's not Amy's job as a defense attorney. The author might be conflating personal feelings with professional duties.\n\nSo the author's decision to cut off Amy might be based on a misunderstanding of Amy's role. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off Amy because they didn't recognize her professional ethics. Amy is doing her job, and the author is punishing her for it, even though her actions are within the bounds of her profession.\n\nAlternatively, if the author's feelings are justified because Amy is acting unethically (like hiding evidence or something), but the story doesn't mention that. Amy just says she wants to win and build her reputation, which is part of being a defense attorney. So the author might not be in the wrong if Amy is indeed acting unethically, but there's no indication of that here. So the author's mistake is in assuming that Amy's professional actions are morally wrong, when they are actually part of her job. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, wait. Wait, the options are A (author is wrong) or B (author not wrong). If the author is acting based on a misunderstanding, then they're in the wrong. But if the author is correct in thinking Amy is doing something unethical, then the author isn't wrong. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is cutting off Amy over something that's actually Amy's professional duty, then the author is in the wrong. If Amy is acting unethically, then the author might not be. But based on the given information, Amy is just doing her job. The author may not understand the legal system's requirement for defense attorneys. Therefore, the author is wrong in cutting off Amy because they're misjudging her professional conduct. So answer A.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is right that Amy is acting unethically, then they aren't in the wrong. But in this case, Amy is acting ethically, so the author is wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
