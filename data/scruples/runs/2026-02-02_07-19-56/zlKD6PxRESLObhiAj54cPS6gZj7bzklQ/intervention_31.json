We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's older sister, Jane, is arrested for fraud, and the younger sister, Amy, is representing her pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, even though everyone knows Jane is guilty. The author confronts Amy, who explains she's focused on winning the case, not on proving guilt. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing, leading to a conflict where Amy feels the author is being judgmental.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. As an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane. The principle of attorney-client privilege and the obligation to provide zealous representation might require Amy to defend Jane regardless of personal feelings. Even if Jane is guilty, the legal system is supposed to ensure that everyone gets a fair trial, so lawyers can't be biased towards proving guilt. \n\nThe author is upset because they believe Amy isn't doing the right thing morally. But Amy's actions might be within her professional ethics. The author's decision to cut off Amy could be seen as imposing their own moral standards on Amy's professional conduct. However, the author is also within their right to set boundaries in their personal relationships, especially if they feel Amy is compromising her integrity.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's argument about wanting to represent cases where she can be successful and being a woman in a male-dominated field might be context. She could feel pressured to take on high-profile cases to prove herself. But the author's concern is that Amy is exploiting the situation, which might be a valid ethical concern.\n\nThe key here is the conflict between personal ethics and professional responsibilities. The author believes Amy should act morally, while Amy is following her professional duties. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal choice, but whether that's wrong depends on whose perspective you take. \n\nIn the legal system, the role of a defense attorney isn't to judge guilt but to ensure the prosecution meets its burden. If Amy is doing her job correctly, even if she thinks Jane is guilty, the author's disapproval might be misplaced. However, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to distance themselves from Amy's actions if they feel it's morally wrong. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author overstepped by cutting contact based on Amy's professional decisions. Since Amy's actions might be ethically required, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring her. Alternatively, the author's right to their own moral stance could justify cutting contact. But considering the legal framework, the author's stance might not align with professional ethics, making them at fault.\n"
