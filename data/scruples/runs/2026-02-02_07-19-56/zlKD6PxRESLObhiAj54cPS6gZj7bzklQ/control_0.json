We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author is justified in cutting off contact with their sister Amy because Amy is defending their other sister Jane, who's clearly guilty of fraud. \n\nFirst, the author's main reason for cutting off Amy is that Amy isn't doing her job to prove Jane's guilt and is instead trying to get the best outcome for Jane. The author believes Amy is being unethical as an attorney by not pursuing a guilty verdict and instead focusing on winning at any cost. \n\nBut wait, as an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, regardless of their guilt. That's part of the legal system. Lawyers are supposed to zealously represent their clients, even if they know the client is guilty. So Amy is doing her job. The author is upset because Amy isn't using her position to ensure Jane gets punished, which is a conflict between personal feelings and professional ethics.\n\nThe author is close to Amy, but their relationship is strained because of Jane. The author feels betrayed that Amy isn't upholding their family's moral standards. However, Amy is choosing to prioritize her career and client's interests over family loyalty. The author is threatening to cut off contact if Amy doesn't act in the way they think is right, which is a personal choice but may not be fair to Amy.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're making a personal decision about their relationship based on Amy's professional role. Amy is doing her job, which the author disagrees with on a moral level. But the author's right to cut off Amy is about their own boundaries. While it's harsh, the author isn't in the wrong for making that decision unless they are violating any laws or ethical standards themselves. The author isn't harming Amy directly; it's a choice to end contact. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries in their relationship based on personal ethics, even if others disagree.\n"
