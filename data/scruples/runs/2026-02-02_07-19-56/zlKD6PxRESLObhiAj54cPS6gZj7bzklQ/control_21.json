We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is cutting off their sister Amy, a defense attorney, because of her decisions in representing their older sister Jane, who is guilty of fraud.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that Amy is defending Jane even though everyone knows Jane is guilty. The author thinks Amy should be trying to prove Jane's guilt or at least secure some punishment like community service. But Amy is focusing on winning the case, regardless of Jane's guilt, and seems to enjoy the challenge of defending someone clearly guilty to get them off. The author is upset and threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right\" thing, which leads to Amy getting angry and the author now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, Amy's job as an attorney is to provide the best defense possible for her client, regardless of their guilt. It's her ethical obligation to represent Jane zealously, even if Jane is guilty. The author might not agree with Amy's approach, but as a defense attorney, that's part of the role. Amy is doing her job, even if it's frustrating for the author.\n\nThe author is upset because they believe in holding people accountable and want Jane to face consequences. However, the justice system is supposed to determine guilt based on evidence, not personal feelings. Amy's decision to not push for a confession or a guilty plea might be strategic, given the lack of sufficient evidence. She might think that convicting Jane without enough evidence would be unjust, even if Jane is guilty, because the system requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe author's threat to cut off contact is based on their moral stance, but they're essentially asking Amy to compromise her professional ethics. That's a conflict between personal ethics and professional ethics. Amy is following her professional code, while the author is expecting her to act according to their personal morals.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author isn't legally wrong for feeling that way, but they are imposing their moral expectations on Amy's professional role. Amy can't abandon her client based on guilt without ethical issues. The author's demand for Amy to act in a certain way might be unrealistic given her legal duties. However, the author's decision to cut contact is their own choice, based on their values. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether they should have respected Amy's professional obligations. Since Amy is doing her job, the author's reaction is more about personal conflict than wrongdoing. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here.\n"
