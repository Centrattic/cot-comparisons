We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister, Jane, is a fraudster with a history of bad behavior. The other sister, Amy, is an attorney who's representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane, even though they both believe Jane is guilty. Amy's rationale is about winning the case, not necessarily seeking justice, and she's focused on her career. The author threatens to cut off contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing,\" leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here. Amy is an attorney, so her job is to defend her client, Jane, to the best of her ability. That's her professional duty. Even if she believes Jane is guilty, she's supposed to provide a vigorous defense. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, but Amy is doing her job. The author is taking a moral stance, thinking Amy should act morally by helping to convict Jane, but that's not how the legal system works. Attorneys are supposed to defend all clients regardless of guilt. \n\nThe author is considering cutting off Amy because they disagree with her professional conduct. But Amy is doing what she's trained to do. The author's anger might stem from frustration with Jane's actions and Amy's role in potentially letting her get away with it. However, the author has a right to be upset, but cutting off a sister over this is a personal choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal ethics standpoint, Amy is doing her job. From a family perspective, the author is struggling with their sister's bad actions. The author's decision to cut off Amy is a personal boundary. Whether that's wrong depends on perspective. The author isn't obligated to support Amy's actions, but is cutting off family over this the right move? It's a family matter where both sides have valid points. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries based on their values, even if Amy is doing her job. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
