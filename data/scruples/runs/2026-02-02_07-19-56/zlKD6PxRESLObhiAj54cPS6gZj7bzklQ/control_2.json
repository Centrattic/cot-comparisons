We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is cutting off contact with their sister Amy because Amy is representing their other sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud. The author thinks Amy should be helping to prove Jane's guilt, but Amy wants to win the case regardless of Jane's guilt. The author is upset about this and threatens to cut contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Amy is an attorney, right? So her job is to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. That's the role of a defense attorney. The author seems to think that Amy should help convict Jane, but that's not how the legal system works. Attorneys are supposed to provide a vigorous defense, even if they believe their client is guilty. This is part of the principle of a fair trial and the right to counsel. So maybe Amy is just doing her job, and the author is misunderstanding her role.\n\nThen there's the personal relationship aspect. The author is close to Amy, but they have a complicated history with Jane. The author's frustration is understandable, given Jane's history of immoral behavior. However, the author is demanding that Amy act against her professional duties, which isn't feasible. The author's threat to cut off contact because Amy is doing her job as a defense attorney might be unreasonable. It's one thing to be upset about Jane's actions, but another to hold Amy responsible for not acting against her professional ethics.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that they would cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing\" seems harsh. Amy's actions are within her professional boundaries, and the author has no right to dictate how she should perform her duties. While the author's concern about Amy's future with the family and her career might be valid, it doesn't make them right to threaten cutting her off. The author is conflating personal feelings with professional responsibilities here.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's approach could be seen as questionable ethically. She's not trying to secure a confession or push for a guilty plea, which might be what the author wants. But as a defense attorney, her goal is to get the best possible outcome for her client, which might mean negotiating a plea deal or getting the charges dropped, not necessarily proving guilt. The author might not fully grasp how the legal system works here, leading to their frustration.\n\nIn terms of moral rightness, the author's position is based on a personal belief that Jane should be punished, but Amy is fulfilling her professional role. The author is punishing Amy for doing her job, which might not be fair. However, the author's emotional reaction is influenced by their close relationship and the family dynamics. It's a tough spot, but the key is whether Amy is violating any professional standards. If she's not, then the author is in the wrong for threatening to cut her off.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because they're upset about Amy's actions, but Amy is actually doing her job correctly. The author's misunderstanding of her role leads them to take a harsh stance, which might be misguided. However, since Amy is acting within her professional duties, the author's actions (threatening to cut contact) might be seen as an overreaction. But the main point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Amy is doing her job, the author's anger is misplaced. Therefore, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), but I need to check if the author's actions are justified. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is cutting off their sister due to professional ethics, they might be in the right because Amy is doing her job. But maybe the author is wrong to interfere in Amy's professional decisions. So it's a bit of a toss-up. The key is that the author is cutting off family because Amy is doing her job as an attorney. Since the author has no legal right to dictate Amy's professional conduct, their reaction is inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If Amy is correctly doing her job, then the author is wrong to cut her off. So the answer would be A. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have a strained relationship and are acting based on their values. But I think the main ethical point is that Amy is acting within her professional role, so the author is wrong to cut her off. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong). Wait, the options are A for yes (author in the wrong) and B for no. So if the author is wrong to cut off Amy for doing her job, then answer A. Otherwise, B. Given that Amy is an attorney and the author is interfering with her professional duties based on personal feelings, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
