We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her actions as an attorney. The situation involves the author's sister, Jane, who's been charged with fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney representing Jane. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is focused on winning the case regardless of morality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to prove guilt. The legal principle of zealous representation means that attorneys are supposed to advocate for their clients' best interests, even if they personally believe the client is guilty. So Amy is doing her job by trying to get the best outcome for Jane, which might be a plea deal or dismissal if the evidence is weak.\n\nThe author feels that Amy is being unethical, but from a legal standpoint, Amy is within her rights. The author is upset because of their personal relationship and the family dynamics. They might believe that Amy should take a moral stance, but the legal system doesn't require defense attorneys to act as prosecutors. The author's decision to cut off Amy is based on their disagreement with her professional actions, which are, in fact, professional obligations.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings about Jane's guilt and the family's strained relationships add a layer of complexity. The author values moral integrity and expects Amy to act accordingly, but Amy's career path and desire for success are also legitimate. The conflict here is between personal ethics and professional duties. \n\nSince Amy is acting within her professional responsibilities, the author's decision to cut her off isn't necessarily wrong from their perspective, but whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on whether the author should have accepted Amy's professional actions. The key point is that Amy is doing her job, and the author's reaction is a personal choice based on their values. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off Amy, because the author's moral stance, while perhaps conflicting with legal ethics, is a personal decision.\n"
