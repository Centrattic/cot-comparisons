We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation involves their sister Jane being arrested for fraud and the author's younger sister Amy, an attorney, defending her pro bono.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prosecute Jane despite believing she's guilty. They wanted Amy to ensure Jane faces consequences, but Amy is more focused on winning the case, not on proving guilt. The author then threatens to cut off contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing,\" leading to a fallout.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jane is guilty and deserves punishment, while Amy is prioritizing her career and success. The author feels betrayed because Amy isn't acting in line with their moral stance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy.\n\nI need to evaluate the ethics here. As a defense attorney, Amy's role is to represent her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. That's a fundamental principle of the legal system. The author is upset because Amy isn't helping to ensure Jane's conviction, which might be a misunderstanding of the attorney's duty. However, the author is close to Amy and expected her to act in a way that aligns with their moral views, which might be an unrealistic expectation.\n\nOn the author's side, they might feel justified because they believe Jane is guilty and deserve punishment. But legally and ethically, Amy must provide the best defense possible. The author's reaction of cutting off contact seems extreme, especially considering that Amy's job requires her to defend clients regardless of their guilt. The author might be projecting their personal judgment onto Amy's professional duty.\n\nHowever, the personal relationship complicates things. The author might feel that Amy has betrayed their family values, but Amy is acting within her professional role. The author's decision to cut off contact is a personal choice, but whether they're in the wrong depends on whether their expectations were reasonable.\n\nIn legal terms, Amy is doing her job correctly. Emotionally, the author is hurt and feels abandoned. But is the author wrong for holding Amy to their personal moral standards? The answer hinges on whether the author's expectations of Amy's role are valid. Since Amy's job isn't to prove guilty but to defend, the author's criticism might be misplaced. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting Amy's professional obligations.\n"
