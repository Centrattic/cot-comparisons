We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, an attorney, because she's defending their other sister, Jane, who's guilty of fraud.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is close to Amy, but they have a strained relationship with Jane. Jane is clearly guilty according to the author, and Amy is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt, even though Amy herself acknowledges Jane is guilty. The author feels Amy is just trying to win at any cost and is being unethical, leading to a rift.\n\nSo the key points are: The author wants Amy to do the \"right thing\" by ensuring Jane gets punished, but Amy is focused on winning the case regardless of ethics. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing, and then does so when Amy refuses.\n\nNow, considering ethics and legal principles. As an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane, to provide the best defense possible. Even if Jane is guilty, the legal system requires that everyone gets a fair trial. So Amy's job isn't to determine guilt but to ensure the process is followed correctly. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane convicted, not realizing that her role is to defend her sister, not to prosecute.\n\nThe author's expectation that Amy should act against her professional duty is problematic. Legally, Amy is doing her job by providing a strong defense. The author's frustration stems from a moral conflict but misunderstands the attorney's role. Cutting off a family member over this might be harsh, but perhaps the author is justified in feeling betrayed. However, the author is imposing their moral standards on Amy's professional conduct, which might not be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's actions, while potentially ethically questionable in the author's eyes, are within her professional obligations. She's defending Jane as she should, even if the outcome is that an obviously guilty person might go free. The author might be in the wrong for pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties and then cutting her off for doing her job as required.\n\nSo the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they are holding Amy to a moral standard that conflicts with her professional responsibilities.\n"
