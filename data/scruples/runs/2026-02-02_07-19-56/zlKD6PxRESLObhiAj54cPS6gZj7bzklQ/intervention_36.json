We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, over her decision to defend their sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close to Amy, who is a defense attorney. Jane, the older sister, is arrested, and Amy takes her case pro-bono. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty and that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt, instead focusing on winning regardless of Jane's guilt. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing, which leads to Amy getting angry and the author cutting off contact.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and moral aspects. Amy, as an attorney, has a professional duty to her client. Even if she believes the client is guilty, defense attorneys are supposed to provide the best possible defense, not to seek the truth or punish the client. The author seems to think Amy should be trying to get Jane convicted, which is not her role. So maybe the author is misunderstanding Amy's professional obligations.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Amy is being unethical by defending Jane when she's guilty. But in reality, the justice system allows for defense attorneys to represent clients even if they believe the client is guilty, as long as they are following ethical guidelines. Amy's job is to ensure Jane's rights are protected and that the prosecution meets the burden of proof. So the author might be wrong in expecting Amy to act as a prosecutor instead of a defense attorney.\n\nAdditionally, the author is cutting off a family member over this, which is a personal decision. While they have the right to make that choice, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The author might be in the right in their personal decision, but they are wrong in their misunderstanding of Amy's professional role. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they are justified in cutting contact.\n\nAnother angle: Amy's actions as a lawyer are within professional ethics. The author is upset because Amy is representing someone they both believe is guilty, but the legal system allows for that. The author might be in the right for cutting off a sister who is acting against their values, but it's a personal choice. However, the author's justification for cutting contact is based on a misunderstanding of Amy's role, so maybe the author is not in the wrong for making that choice based on their own values.\n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. Let me check again. If the author is cutting off Amy because she's doing her job correctly, then the author is in the wrong. However, if the author believes Amy is acting unethically in her role, even if that's not the case, the author's reaction is based on a personal moral stance.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n\n- Amy is acting within her professional duties as a defense attorney.\n- The author is cutting off a family member because of that.\n- The author's reasoning is based on a misunderstanding of legal ethics.\n- The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting contact.\n\nIf the author's decision is based on a valid misunderstanding (thinking Amy should act as a prosecutor), then the author might not be in the wrong. But if Amy is actually fulfilling her role correctly, then the author is wrong to cut contact. However, cutting off family is a personal choice, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice, regardless of the misunderstanding.\n\nBut the AITA questions often look at whether the person is in the wrong for their actions. If the author is cutting off a sister over a professional decision that is ethically sound, the author might be in the wrong for not accepting Amy's role. Alternatively, if the author is acting on their own moral beliefs, even if they're misinformed, it's still their choice.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified. Since Amy is doing her job correctly, the author's decision to cut her off is based on a misunderstanding. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing to cut contact based on their own moral standards, even if those standards don't align with legal ethics. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting on their own moral beliefs, even if they're misinformed. Alternatively, if the author is wrong for not understanding the legal role, then they might be in the wrong for cutting contact over a professional decision that's valid.\n\nBut in the legal system, defense attorneys can represent clients they believe are guilty. So the author is wrong in thinking Amy is acting unethically, which might make the author in the wrong for cutting contact. However, the act of cutting contact is a personal choice. So maybe the answer is B because the author isn't in the wrong for their personal decision, even if they misunderstood Amy's role. But the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, so perhaps the system is leaning towards A.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. The key is whether the author's actions are morally wrong. If Amy is doing her job correctly, then the author's cutting contact is a personal choice, but the author is not wrong for making that choice based on their own values. Therefore, the answer would be B (No). However, if the author is wrong for not respecting Amy's professional role, then A. I think the correct answer is B, because the author isn't in the wrong for cutting contact, even if their reasoning is flawed. The decision to cut off family is a personal one, and the author isn't violating any moral code by doing so.\n"
