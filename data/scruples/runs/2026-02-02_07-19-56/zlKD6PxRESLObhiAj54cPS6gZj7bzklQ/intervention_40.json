We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their sister, Jane, who's an attorney and got arrested for fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney and is representing Jane, even though they both know Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is planning to get her off, which makes the author want to cut contact with Amy.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to prove them guilty. That's the role of the prosecution. So maybe Amy is doing her job correctly by focusing on the evidence and the case's strengths, not the client's character. The author might not understand that defense attorneys don't have a duty to see their clients punished; their duty is to provide a fair defense.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author has a strained relationship with Jane and a close one with Amy. The author is upset because Amy is representing Jane, who they believe is guilty. But Amy might see this as an opportunity for her career, maybe to take on high-profile cases. The author is pressuring Amy to act in a way that's against her professional obligations, which could be why Amy is resistant.\n\nThe author is threatening to cut contact if Amy doesn't \"do the right thing,\" which seems like a breach of familial trust. However, from the author's perspective, they feel Amy is enabling Jane's behavior. But Amy is doing her job, even if it goes against the family's moral stance. The author might not realize that Amy's role is to follow the law, not personal ethics.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They might be for not respecting Amy's professional duties and for threatening to cut contact over a decision that's within Amy's rights as an attorney. But Amy is also making a choice that the author finds morally objectionable. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author argues that Jane is guilty, and Amy isn't trying to prove that. But legally, Amy isn't obligated to do so. The author's expectation that Amy should act against her professional duties might be unreasonable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring Amy and cutting contact based on her job performance. \n\nAlternatively, if Amy is using her position to manipulate the system, maybe the author has a point, but that's not the case here. Amy is doing her job, so the author's response is the issue. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they're upset about a family member's unethical choices and taking a stand. But I need to check if their actions are justified.\n\nWait, but cutting contact is a personal choice. The author isn't forcing Amy to do anything; they're just deciding to stop contact if Amy proceeds. But the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Amy's professional decisions. However, the author's stance is based on their moral judgment. It's a family matter where personal ethics clash with professional duties. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They are making a choice based on their values and the family dynamics, even if Amy is doing her job correctly. The author's decision to cut contact is their personal boundary, and they aren't in the wrong for that.\n"
