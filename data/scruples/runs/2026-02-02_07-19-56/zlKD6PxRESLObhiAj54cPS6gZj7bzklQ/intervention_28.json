We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation involves their sister Jane being charged with fraud, and the author's younger sister Amy, a criminal defense attorney, defending her pro-bono. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is close to Amy but has a strained relationship with Jane. They believe Jane is guilty and lack moral compass. Amy is representing Jane, even though she agrees Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to make Jane confess or face consequences, and threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing.\" Amy gets defensive, talks about her career, and they argue. The author then cuts off Amy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Amy is a defense attorney, and her job is to defend her client, not necessarily to prove guilt. Even if she believes the client is guilty, her duty is to provide the best defense possible. The author is upset because Amy is helping Jane who they consider morally wrong. However, Amy's actions might be within her professional obligations. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off Amy is based on their moral stance, but is that justified? The author might be prioritizing their own morals over Amy's professional role. However, Amy's choice to defend Jane could be about her career, and the author's threat to cut contact could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the author's relationship with Amy is important. They're close, and cutting off contact is a significant action. But is the author wrong to demand Amy act a certain way in her professional role? The ethical duty of an attorney is to their client, not to the family or the author's moral standards. So maybe the author is wrong to expect Amy to not defend Jane just because they think she's guilty. \n\nAlternatively, the author's feelings are valid because they have a strained relationship with Jane and see her actions as harmful. But Amy's actions are within her professional responsibilities. The author's threat to cut contact might be a personal reaction, not based on right or wrong in a legal sense. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong) if we consider that they have a right to their feelings about Amy's representation. However, the legal ethics say that an attorney must defend all clients regardless of guilt. The author's anger might stem from personal issues rather than legal ethics. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for trying to influence Amy's professional decisions. \n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting contact. If the author is imposing their moral views on Amy's professional duties, then maybe the author is in the wrong. However, if the author feels that Amy's actions are unethical, even though they are legally required, then the author's stance is based on personal ethics. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The key is whether cutting contact is justified. Amy is doing her job, which is to defend Jane. The author is upset that Amy isn't acting morally in their eyes, but as a defense attorney, Amy's role isn't to punish the guilty but to ensure due process. Therefore, the author's demand for Amy to act a certain way might be misguided, making the author in the wrong for cutting contact. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). \n\nBut I need to be careful. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to be upset about their sister's actions and the defense strategy. The line between personal feelings and professional ethics is thin here. \n\nHmm. Considering all angles, the author might be wrong to cut contact because Amy is fulfilling her professional duties, regardless of the author's personal beliefs. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
