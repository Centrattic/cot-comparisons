We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author has an older sister, Jane, who's been arrested for fraud. They already had a strained relationship because Jane's known for her immoral behavior, lies, and stealing. The younger sister, Amy, is a criminal defense attorney who offered to represent Jane for free. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane even though both agree Jane is guilty. The author feels that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, and instead is just trying to win the case no matter the ethics. The author threatened to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing,\" leading to a fallout.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical aspects. As an attorney, Amy has a professional duty to defend her client to the best of her ability, even if she believes the client is guilty. The legal system is built on the principle that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and defense attorneys are supposed to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. So, from a legal standpoint, Amy's role is to advocate for Jane, not to confirm her guilt. The author seems to think Amy should be trying to prove Jane guilty, which might be a misunderstanding of her role as a defense attorney.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset because they believe Jane is clearly guilty and that Amy is enabling her by providing a strong defense. The author's threat to cut contact is based on the belief that Amy is not doing the \"right thing.\" But is the author in the wrong for that?\n\nThe author's perspective is that Amy should prioritize moral correctness over winning the case. However, the legal system isn't about personal morality; it's about ensuring fair trials. If Amy is doing her job correctly, she's fulfilling her professional duties, regardless of her personal feelings about Jane's guilt. The author might not realize that an attorney's role isn't to judge the client's guilt but to ensure the legal process is followed.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reaction of threatening to cut contact could be seen as extreme. While it's their right to express their disapproval, cutting someone off entirely because they disagree on professional ethics might be an overreaction. However, the author might feel that their family's reputation is at stake or that Amy is compromising her integrity for career advancement, which is a personal value conflict.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If Amy is acting within her professional boundaries, then the author's anger might stem from a misunderstanding of her role. In that case, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting Amy's professional obligations. Alternatively, if the author's concerns are valid (e.g., Amy is being unethical in her defense tactics), but the author isn't the one to dictate her professional conduct, then the author's actions might not be wrong, but their approach is misguided.\n\nAnother angle is family dynamics. The author is close to Amy, but their relationship is now strained because of this. The author's threat to cut contact might be seen as a personal choice, but it's not necessarily wrong in a moral sense unless it violates some ethical standard. However, the author's justification is based on their belief that Amy is doing the wrong thing, which they might not fully understand.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether Amy's actions are within her professional duties. Since defense attorneys are supposed to defend their clients regardless of personal beliefs, the author's disapproval might be unwarranted. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing Amy's professional role and for threatening to cut contact based on that misunderstanding.\n"
