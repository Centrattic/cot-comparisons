We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author's older sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro-bono. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty, and Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but instead is trying to get her off. The author confronted Amy, who admitted Jane is guilty but is choosing to defend her aggressively to win. The author then says they'll cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing, and Amy gets angry. Now the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off Amy because of her professional choices. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nAmy is doing her job as an attorney. Her role is to defend her client, even if she believes the client is guilty. The legal system allows for this to ensure fair trials and protect the rights of the accused. The author might not agree with Amy's approach, but as an attorney, Amy has a professional duty to provide the best defense regardless of her personal beliefs. The author's anger could stem from frustration with Jane's actions or Amy's methods, but Amy is following her professional code.\n\nThe author's decision to cut contact seems harsh. The relationship between siblings is personal, but Amy is acting within her professional ethics. The author is imposing their moral judgment on Amy's career choices, which might not be fair. However, the author might feel betrayed because Amy is representing someone (Jane) they both see as guilty, and Amy is not taking the author's perspective into account.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's actions are about her career and professional growth. She might feel that the author is being judgmental and not supporting her in a difficult path. The author's threat to cut contact is a significant consequence based on Amy's professional decisions, which could be seen as overreacting. The author might be projecting their own feelings towards Jane onto Amy's actions.\n\nLegal ethics require defense attorneys to zealously represent their clients, even if they believe the client is guilty. So Amy's actions are within her professional obligations. The author's disapproval might be valid on a personal level, but it's not Amy's fault she's doing her job. Therefore, the author cutting off Amy could be seen as wrong because they're punishing Amy for professional conduct that's legally and ethically appropriate.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The author is upset because they feel Amy is enabling Jane by not getting her to confess or seeking appropriate punishment. However, Amy's role isn't to punish Jane but to ensure the legal process is followed. The author might not understand the legal process here, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's disapproval is based on personal morals conflicting with Amy's professional ethics. The author is not in the wrong for feeling hurt, but cutting off a sister over her career choices might be an overreaction. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, considering Amy is acting within her profession, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong for cutting contact based on professional decisions.\n"
