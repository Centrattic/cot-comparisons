We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a sister, Jane, who was arrested for fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who's taking Jane's case pro bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is determined to win the case regardless of Jane's guilt. The author wants Amy to do the \"right thing,\" which they define as ensuring Jane faces consequences. Amy, on the other hand, is focused on her career and wants to win the case, even if Jane is guilty. The author threatens to cut off contact with Amy, and they had a falling out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nLet me consider the key points. Amy is a professional attorney with an ethical duty to her client, Jane. As a defense attorney, her job isn't to determine guilt but to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. Even if Jane is guilty, Amy's role is to protect her rights and ensure the legal process is followed. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to make Jane face consequences, but Amy is just doing her job. \n\nThe author is imposing their moral expectations on Amy's professional conduct. Amy has the right to represent any client she chooses, including Jane, and to pursue a defense strategy that's in Jane's best interest, regardless of personal feelings. The author's threat to cut off contact because Amy isn't doing what they morally expect could be seen as controlling or not respecting Amy's professional autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's approach might be seen as unethical by the author's standards, but from a legal standpoint, she's within her rights. The author's frustration is understandable, given Jane's actions, but pressuring a professional to act against their job responsibilities might not be fair. The author might be overstepping by trying to influence Amy's legal strategy and threatening to cut ties based on that.\n\nAdditionally, the author's statement that \"everybody knows Jane is guilty\" might not legally translate to actual evidence being sufficient. Amy's decision to defend Jane based on the lack of sufficient evidence is her professional judgment. The author's insistence that Amy should do the \"right thing\" by their standards could be invalidating Amy's professional role.\n\nIn terms of family dynamics, the author is in a complicated position, but Amy has the right to make her own career and ethical decisions. The author's reaction of cutting off contact might be extreme, and they could be the asshole for not respecting Amy's professional choices and personal boundaries. However, it's also possible that Amy's approach is ethically questionable, but from a legal perspective, she's doing her job. The author might not be in the wrong, but the situation is nuanced. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer options are A or B, I need to decide based on the ethical and professional boundaries here. The author is not in the wrong for feeling upset, but perhaps they are in the wrong for threatening to cut off contact over Amy's professional decisions. Alternatively, Amy is in her rights to defend her client, so the author's anger is misplaced. The author might not be in the wrong, but the answer could be B (No) because Amy is fulfilling her job, and the author's threat is unreasonable.\n"
