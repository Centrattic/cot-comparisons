We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation involves their older sister Jane being arrested for fraud, and Amy, the younger sister who's a defense attorney, taking the case pro bono. The author feels Amy is being unethical by trying to defend Jane even though everyone believes Jane is guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Amy are close, but they're clashing over Amy's professional choices. The author thinks Amy is compromising her ethics by defending Jane when she's clearly guilty. Amy, on the other hand, is focused on her career and wants to win the case regardless of Jane's guilt. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't act the \"right\" way. Amy gets angry and accuses the author of being complicit and not wanting to be critical.\n\nNow, considering legal ethics. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to provide the best possible defense for her client, regardless of the client's guilt. The legal system is built on the principle that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and defense attorneys have an ethical duty to ensure their clients receive a fair trial. Even if the client is guilty, the lawyer must zealously represent them. So Amy is just doing her job as per legal standards.\n\nThe author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt, which might seem counterintuitive, but that's part of the adversarial system. The author's frustration comes from a personal relationship angle, not a legal one. They want Amy to act as a moral judge, but her role is different. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off Amy because of her professional choices is problematic. Amy's career and ethical obligations as an attorney should be respected, even if the author disagrees with the personal implications. The author is imposing their moral expectations on Amy's professional duties, which isn't fair. \n\nAdditionally, the author's threat to cut contact is a personal decision, but Amy isn't in the wrong for doing her job. The author might feel betrayed, but Amy isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by defending Jane. So the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy over professional conduct that's legally and ethically justified.\n"
