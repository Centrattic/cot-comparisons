We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's older sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The author has a strained relationship with Jane but is close to the younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro-bono, even though everyone knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is working to get her off, even though Jane admitted guilt in a way. The author confronts Amy, and they argue, leading to the author threatening to cut contact.\n\nFirst, the author believes Amy is making the wrong choice by defending Jane even though they know she's guilty. Amy, on the other hand, is focused on winning the case and her career, maybe showing ambition and competitiveness. The author feels betrayed and wants Amy to do the right thing, but Amy insists on her professional approach.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong for cutting off Amy? Well, the author's actions are based on moral judgment of Amy's decisions. But as an attorney, Amy is bound by her professional ethics. Attorneys have a duty to their clients to provide the best possible defense, regardless of the client's guilt. It's part of the justice system. So Amy is doing her job, even if the author disagrees with the outcome.\n\nThe author is upset because Amy is representing someone they all know is guilty, but Amy's role isn't to determine guilt; it's to ensure the legal process is followed. The author might not understand that defense attorneys must protect their clients' rights, even if they believe the client is guilty. By cutting off Amy, the author is using their personal morals against her professional duties, which might not be fair.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a personal relationship with Amy. The threat to cut contact is a personal decision based on their values clashing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding Amy to a higher moral standard in a personal relationship. Amy might feel that her professional ethics are separate from her personal life, but the author isn't considering that.\n\nSo, the key points are: Amy's professional obligations vs. the author's personal values. The author is upset because Amy is not doing what they see as the right thing, but Amy is doing what her job requires. The author's reaction might be justified in their own eyes, but legally and ethically, Amy is in the right. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way, but maybe they're overreaching in cutting contact. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, which might depend on whether Amy is actually violating any rules. Since she's a defense attorney, she's doing her job. The author's judgment might be misplaced, so the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have the right to their feelings, but maybe the action of cutting off is extreme. Wait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not if the action is justified. Since the author's actions stem from a moral disagreement, which is a personal choice, they might not be in the wrong, but their approach is harsh. However, in terms of right or wrong, it's more about whether the author acted inappropriately. Since Amy is doing her job, the author's cutting off might be their prerogative, so the answer is B.\n"
