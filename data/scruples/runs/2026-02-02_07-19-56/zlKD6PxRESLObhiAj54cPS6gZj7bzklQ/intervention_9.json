We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's sister, Jane, is a fraud and has been arrested. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who's taking Jane's case pro bono. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane even though they all know Jane is guilty. The author confronts Amy, and when Amy says she's not trying to prove guilt but wants to win, the author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't \"do the right thing.\" Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off Amy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to represent Jane to the best of her ability, regardless of her personal feelings. The legal system is supposed to protect the rights of the accused, even if they're guilty. So Amy is doing her job by defending Jane. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove guilt, but that's not the role of a defense attorney. Their role is to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof, not to prove the defendant guilty.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The author has a strained relationship with Jane, but Amy is a different person. The author is imposing their moral expectations on Amy's professional duties. The author's threat to cut off contact because Amy is doing her job seems harsh. While the author is upset, they might be overstepping by pressuring Amy to act against her professional obligations.\n\nHowever, the author is also concerned about Jane's actions and the potential for Amy to get into trouble. The author might feel that Amy is compromising her integrity for career advancement. But Amy has her own reasons, like wanting to prove herself in a male-dominated field, which adds context to her decisions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're cutting off a family member because of a difference in values and professional ethics. The author might not realize that Amy's job isn't to judge guilt but to ensure fair treatment. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling, expecting Amy to abandon her professional ethics for the family's approval. On the other hand, Amy's approach might be seen as ethically questionable from a personal standpoint, but legally, she's correct in her approach.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author's main mistake is misunderstanding Amy's role as a defense attorney and threatening to cut contact based on that misunderstanding. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
