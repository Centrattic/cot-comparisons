We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a sister named Jane who was charged with fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who's taking Jane's case pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is focusing on winning the case, even though everyone knows Jane is guilty. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't do the \"right thing,\" which leads to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author feels that Jane's actions are morally wrong and that she deserves consequences. However, as a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, regardless of guilt. In the legal system, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, so Amy's role is to ensure Jane's rights are protected and that the prosecution meets the burden of proof. Even if the author and others believe Jane is guilty, Amy's duty is to provide a fair defense.\n\nThe author is cutting off Amy because of her professional decisions. That might be seen as overstepping because Amy is doing her job. The author's frustration might stem from personal feelings towards Jane and their strained relationship, but using that to cut off a family member over a professional decision could be problematic. The author might not be considering Amy's professional ethics and the importance of her career.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about Amy's moral stance. Amy is using her sister's case to gain success and attention, which the author finds unethical. But in the legal field, taking cases that challenge you or offer high visibility can be part of career advancement. However, the author might feel that Amy is exploiting the situation, especially since they are family and the author believes Jane is guilty. The author's threat to cut off contact could be seen as a way to control the situation, which might not be fair to Amy.\n\nAlso, Amy's response about wanting to represent controversial cases like O.J. suggests she might be more interested in her career image than her sister's fate. The author's reaction is based on a sense of justice and family values, but Amy's actions are within her professional rights. The author's demand for Amy to act in a certain way might be unrealistic, given the attorney-client privilege and the legal professional's obligations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong in terms of their personal feelings and values, but cutting off a family member over a professional decision that's within legal ethics might be too harsh. The author's actions are driven by personal moral conflicts, but they might not have a right to dictate how Amy approaches her job. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here that the author's actions, while not ethically wrong, might be based on a misunderstanding of Amy's professional role.\n"
