We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about cutting off contact with a sister because of her decisions as an attorney. The author's sister, Jane, is accused of fraud, and the other sister, Amy, is representing her even though everyone knows Jane is guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author is upset that Amy is defending Jane despite her obvious guilt. The author wants Amy to ensure Jane is convicted, but Amy is focused on winning the case regardless of ethics. The author feels betrayed and decides to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing. Amy, on the other hand, sees her actions as necessary for her career and to prove herself in a male-dominated field.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider ethical obligations. As a defense attorney, Amy is supposed to provide a zealous defense for her client, regardless of the client's guilt. That's the role of a defense attorney in the legal system. So maybe Amy isn't doing anything wrong by her job. The author is upset because he wants Amy to act as a prosecutor instead, which is a different role.\n\nBut the author is cutting off a family member because of professional decisions. Is that justified? The author has a strained relationship with Jane but is close to Amy. The author's main issue is Amy's approach to Jane's case, which he sees as unethical. However, Amy is doing her job, which might not be personal. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal decision, but is that wrong?\n\nAlso, the author's judgment of Amy's motives might be clouded by his own feelings towards Jane. He doesn't like Jane and sees her as morally bankrupt. His sister Amy is making career choices that he disapproves of. The author is prioritizing his moral stance over family, but is that fair? Amy's actions are within her professional role, even if they are ethically questionable in the author's eyes.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is that Amy is not doing the right thing, but in the legal system, the defense attorney's role is to defend the client, not to determine guilt. Therefore, Amy is fulfilling her professional duty. The author is upset because he wants Amy to act against her professional role, which might not be reasonable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off Amy based on her job performance.\n\nBut then again, the author is a family member, and maybe he has a right to disapprove of his sister's actions in this case. However, Amy is doing her job, and cutting off contact might be an overreaction. The author's actions are personal, but he might feel justified given his views on Jane's guilt and Amy's approach. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nAnother angle: Amy's comments about wanting to be a \"shark\" and represent someone like O.J. might be unprofessional in the author's eyes, but in the legal field, aggressive defense tactics are sometimes necessary. The author is criticizing her for her career choices, which might not be his place. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal choice, but does that make him the asshole?\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not wrong in feeling upset, but cutting off family for professional reasons might be overly harsh. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on whether the person's actions are justified. Since Amy is doing her job, even if the author disagrees with her approach, cutting off contact might be the author being overly judgmental. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if we consider that Amy is misusing her role, but if we consider professional ethics, maybe A (Yes). Hmm.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If Amy is doing her job as a defense attorney, then the author is wrong to hold it against her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off contact based on her professional duties. So the answer would be A. Wait, but the author is upset because Amy is defending a guilty person. But in the legal system, that's the role. So the author is wrong to expect Amy to act as a prosecutor. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is not in the wrong, answer B.\n\nThis is tricky. Let me check again. The author's sister is an attorney, defending their guilty sister. The author is upset and threatens to cut her off. The author is not in the wrong because Amy is misusing her position? Or is Amy doing her job, so the author is wrong to be upset? The AITA often considers if someone is being unreasonable. Since Amy is doing her job, the author's reaction is unreasonable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). But maybe the answer is B because the author is within his rights to cut off family due to personal disagreements.\n\nHmm. I think the correct answer here depends on whether Amy's actions are considered appropriate. Since Amy is a defense attorney, her job is to defend Jane, regardless of guilt. The author is upset because he wants her to act as a prosecutor, which is a different role. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off contact over professional duties. Answer A. But some might argue that Amy is using her position unethically, but in the legal system, that's her job. So the author is in the wrong.\n"
