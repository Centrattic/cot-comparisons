We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. So the situation is that their sister, Jane, is an attorney who was arrested for fraud, and the writer's younger sister, Amy, is defending her pro-bono. The writer is upset because Amy is trying to get Jane off, even though everyone knows Jane is guilty. The writer confronts Amy, and when Amy refuses to try to prove Jane guilty, the writer threatens to cut contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The writer's main issue is that their sister is defending someone they believe is guilty. But Amy is an attorney, so her job is to defend her client to the best of her ability, not to determine guilt. Legal ethics require lawyers to zealously represent their clients, regardless of their personal beliefs about the client's guilt. So Amy is doing her job, even if it's morally difficult for the family. \n\nThe writer is frustrated because they think Amy is being unethical by not trying to get Jane to confess or face consequences. But from a legal standpoint, Amy's role is to use the evidence at hand and fight for Jane's rights within the legal system. She can't force a confession, and without sufficient evidence, the case might not hold up. Amy's statement about wanting to win and not playing nice is about her professional approach, which is within her rights as an attorney.\n\nNow, considering the family dynamics. The writer has a strained relationship with Jane, and Amy is close to them. The writer feels betrayed because Amy is defending Jane, someone they all know is guilty. But Amy might see this as a professional opportunity and a chance to prove her skills, especially if she's facing challenges in a male-dominated field. She might feel she needs to take a strong stance to get ahead.\n\nThe question is whether the writer is in the wrong for threatening to cut contact. The writer's actions are based on their moral judgment of Amy's professional decisions. However, Amy's job is separate from family loyalty. The writer has the right to feel upset, but cutting off a family member over a professional disagreement might be an extreme measure. However, the writer might feel that Amy's actions are a betrayal of their values, making the decision to cut contact personal.\n\nIn legal ethics, the lawyer must remain impartial and focused on the client's interests. Amy is adhering to her professional duties, which the writer might not fully understand. The writer's threat to cut contact could be seen as an overreaction, but it's a personal choice based on their relationship and values. The writer isn't in the wrong legally, but socially, there's a debate about the appropriateness of cutting ties over a professional role.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the writer's actions are justified. Since the lawyer is doing her job, the writer's decision to cut contact is a personal choice, not a legal wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
