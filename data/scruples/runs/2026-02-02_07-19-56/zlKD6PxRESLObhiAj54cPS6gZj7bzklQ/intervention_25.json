We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and their other sister Amy, a defense attorney, is representing Jane pro bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and doesn't want Amy to defend her, especially since Amy isn't trying to prove guilt but is focused on winning. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't do the \"right thing,\" and now the author has cut contact. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, they see Amy as helping a guilty person, which is morally wrong. They feel Amy is compromising her ethics for success. But Amy has her own reasons\u2014maybe she's trying to build her career, face gender bias, etc. The author is cutting off a family member over this. \n\nBut wait, attorneys have a duty to their clients, regardless of the client's guilt. That's a fundamental principle in the legal system. So Amy is just doing her job. The author is upset because they think Amy is helping a guilty person, but legally, that's not the role of a defense attorney. So maybe the author is misunderstanding Amy's role here. \n\nAlso, cutting off a sister is a drastic step. The author is making a moral judgment that Amy is doing something wrong when, in reality, Amy is fulfilling her professional obligations. The author's anger might stem from their personal feelings about Jane, but Amy's actions are within her professional ethics. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Amy's professional role and cutting her off over it. \n\nBut then again, maybe the author has a right to be upset. They might feel betrayed because Amy isn't doing what they see as the \"right\" thing. However, the author's actions (cutting contact) could be seen as overreacting. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified given Amy's professional responsibilities. Since Amy is just doing her job, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring her to act against her professional duties. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong? Wait, no. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's the opposite. Let me think again. \n\nIf Amy is doing her job correctly, then the author's cutting her off is a personal decision based on their own moral stance, but Amy isn't doing anything unethical. Therefore, the author is making a personal choice based on their disagreement with Amy's professional role, which isn't the same as her being unethical. So the author is not wrong in their actions, but maybe they are wrong to interfere with Amy's professional duties. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut in terms of the answer, the options are A (yes, author is in wrong) or B (no). Since the author is cutting off a sister over her job performance (or the perception of it), but Amy is within her rights and duties, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate but not necessarily in the wrong. However, maybe the author is wrong to impose their moral standards on Amy's professional conduct. Hmm. \n\nI think the correct answer here is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. Because the author's actions are based on their personal values and their relationship with their sister Jane. However, considering the legal standards, Amy is doing her job. But the author's decision to cut contact is a personal choice. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Wait, perhaps the answer is A. Let me recheck. \n\nThe user initially said they think the author is in the wrong but wants to know. But according to me, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because Amy is doing her job. But the author is cutting off a sister over a professional disagreement. But is it right to cut someone off for doing their job? That's the crux. So if Amy is just doing her job, the author's cutting her off is a personal decision, but not necessarily wrong. However, maybe the author is wrong to pressure Amy to act outside her professional ethics. \n\nBut the answer is either A or B. I think the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. Because the author has the right to cut off family over personal disagreements, even if the other person is acting within professional ethics. But maybe the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting contact. The answer would depend on societal norms. However, in terms of the situation, Amy is doing her job, so the author's reaction is personal, but not necessarily wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
