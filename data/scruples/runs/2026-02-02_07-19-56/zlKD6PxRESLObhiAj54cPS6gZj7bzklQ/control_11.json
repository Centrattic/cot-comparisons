We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation involves their older sister Jane being charged with fraud, and Amy, the younger sister and defense attorney, is representing Jane pro bono despite knowing she's guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is upset that Amy is defending Jane without trying to prove her guilt, even though Amy believes Jane is guilty. The author feels Amy is being unethical by not ensuring justice, and this leads to a conflict where the author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't act \"rightly.\"\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. As an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane. Even if Amy believes Jane is guilty, she's obligated to provide a vigorous defense. The attorney-client privilege and the duty to zealously represent the client are fundamental in the legal profession. So, from a professional standpoint, Amy is doing her job correctly by defending Jane without trying to incriminate her.\n\nHowever, the author is cutting off contact because of Amy's professional choices. The author believes Amy is helping a guilty person avoid punishment, which is morally wrong in their eyes. But Amy's reasons are based on her career ambitions and professional ethics. The author sees this as a betrayal, while Amy sees it as her right and duty as an attorney.\n\nNow, considering family relationships, the author's decision to cut contact is a personal choice. While Amy's actions are within professional ethics, they might be perceived as morally questionable by the family. The author is prioritizing their moral stance over family ties. Is that justified? It depends on perspective. The author isn't legally wrong, but emotionally, cutting off a sibling is a significant step.\n\nThe key here is understanding the boundaries between professional ethics and personal morals. Amy is doing her job, which might conflict with the family's values, but she's not acting unethically in her role. The author's frustration is valid, but cutting off contact might be an extreme reaction. However, the decision to cut someone off is personal and can't be judged as right or wrong universally. The author isn't in the wrong for holding their beliefs and making that choice, even if it's hurtful.\n"
