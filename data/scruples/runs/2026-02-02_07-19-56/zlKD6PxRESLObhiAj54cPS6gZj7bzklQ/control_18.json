We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if they're at fault for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister, Jane, is arrested for fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who takes on Jane's case pro bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and wants Amy to ensure she's convicted. Amy, however, is focused on winning the case and isn't trying to prove Jane guilty because there's not enough evidence. The author is upset, feels Amy is unethical, and threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing. Amy gets angry and the author is now asking if they're in the wrong for cutting her off.\n\nSo, the key points here are about ethics in professional roles. As an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not necessarily to secure a guilty verdict. The legal principle here is that the defense is supposed to provide the best possible defense, regardless of their personal belief in the client's guilt. Prosecutors are the ones who are supposed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. So Amy's actions, while maybe morally conflicting for the family, are part of her professional duty.\n\nThe author is upset because they think Amy's behavior is wrong and they want her to act in a way that leads to Jane's conviction. However, the author is imposing their personal moral judgment on Amy's professional role. The author is using their relationship to pressure Amy into violating her professional ethics, which is not appropriate. By threatening to cut contact, the author is taking a punitive action based on Amy's professional decisions, which could be seen as wrong because it's not respecting her role as an attorney.\n\nAdditionally, the author is making assumptions about Amy's motivations, thinking she's being a \"shark\" and wants to prove herself at the expense of ethics. But Amy might be following proper legal procedures and just doing her job. The author's reaction might be more about their personal feelings towards Jane and their frustration with the situation, rather than a valid ethical concern about Amy's work.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy might be overstepping by making comments about wanting to represent someone like O.J. Simpson, which could be a red flag for ethical behavior. However, the core issue is whether the author is right to cut off their sister for following her professional duties. Since the author is trying to influence Amy's legal decisions, which she's not obligated to do, the author's actions could be seen as wrong. They should accept that Amy has a professional role to play and not use family ties to interfere with it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're punishing Amy for doing her job as a defense attorney, which requires her to defend clients even if they're guilty. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the author's actions are justified because Amy's behavior is unethical. But actually, the author is wrong to cut off Amy for doing her job properly. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
