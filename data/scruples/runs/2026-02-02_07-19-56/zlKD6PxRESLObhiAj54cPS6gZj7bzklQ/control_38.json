We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their other sister Amy, who is a defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro bono, even though they all know Jane is guilty. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt but is instead focusing on winning the case, which the author sees as unethical. The author threatened to cut contact unless Amy does the \"right thing,\" and Amy got angry, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, the key points. The author believes Jane is guilty and wants her to face consequences. Amy, as a defense attorney, is doing her job by defending Jane, regardless of guilt. In the legal system, the defense's role is to protect the accused, not to prove guilt. Attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, even if they think the client is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane to confess or admit guilt, but that's not how trials work. The defense isn't supposed to help the prosecution; their job is to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that Amy is being unethical by not trying to get Jane convicted. However, Amy is just doing her job. The author's moral stance is that someone guilty should be punished, but the legal system is designed so that the burden of proof is on the prosecution. If the evidence isn't enough, the guilty person might not be convicted. The author is frustrated because Amy isn't \"doing the right thing\" in their eyes, but Amy is following legal ethics.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off Amy is based on personal moral judgment against Amy's professional conduct. However, Amy is in a professional role that requires her to defend her client, even if the client is guilty. The author might feel betrayed, but Amy isn't violating her professional duties. The author is holding Amy to a personal standard that doesn't align with legal ethics. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is cutting off a family member because the attorney isn't doing what the author believes is morally right, but the attorney is just performing her job, then the author's actions might be seen as unjustified. The author is imposing their moral expectations on Amy's professional role, which isn't a valid reason to cut someone off. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they are not respecting Amy's professional responsibilities and are using that as a reason for cutting contact, which isn't the attorney's fault.\n"
