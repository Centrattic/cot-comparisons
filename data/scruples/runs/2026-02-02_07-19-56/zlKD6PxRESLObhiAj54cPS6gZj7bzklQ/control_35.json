We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a sister named Jane who was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their other sister, Amy, who is an attorney. Amy is defending Jane pro-bono, and the author is upset because they think Jane is guilty and Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt. The author even says they would cut off Amy if she doesn't do the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical obligations of a lawyer. Lawyers are supposed to defend their clients zealously, even if they think the client is guilty. Their job is to ensure their client gets a fair trial, not necessarily to make sure they're convicted. So Amy might be doing her job correctly by not trying to get Jane convicted. The author is frustrated because they believe Amy is helping a guilty person avoid consequences, which conflicts with their moral stance.\n\nBut then, the author is threatening to cut off contact with Amy over this. That seems harsh. Even though the author has strong feelings about Jane, Amy is acting within her professional role. The author might be projecting their personal feelings onto Amy's professional duties. The question is whether it's wrong for the author to cut off a sibling over this. The author's actions are based on their own moral judgments about Amy's professional conduct, which Amy might see as an overreach.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels betrayed because they think Amy is helping someone (Jane) who's clearly guilty. They might believe Amy is compromising her integrity by defending Jane without trying to get her convicted. But in legal terms, Amy isn't supposed to try to get her client convicted; she's supposed to defend them. So the author's anger might be misplaced. However, the author is within their right to express their feelings and make decisions about their relationships, even if others might think it's extreme.\n\nThe key points here are the boundaries between personal morality and professional ethics. The author's decision to cut off contact is a personal choice, and while some might disagree with it, it's not necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense. Amy is doing her job, and the author is reacting based on personal values. Since the question is about the author being in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether cutting someone off over their professional ethics is unjustified. I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are expressing their own values, even if others disagree.\n"
