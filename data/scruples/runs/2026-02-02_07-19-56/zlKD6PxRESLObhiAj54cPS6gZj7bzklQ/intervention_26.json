We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's sister Jane is guilty of fraud and is being defended by Amy, another sister. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane without trying to prove her guilt, just to win the case. The author confronts Amy about it, and when Amy doesn't align with their expectations, they threaten to cut contact and do so.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. Legally, as a defense attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane, regardless of personal feelings. The attorney's role is to provide the best possible defense, not to act as a moral arbiter. The author seems to expect Amy to pursue a conviction, which is against her professional obligations. That's a problem. \n\nEthically, the author is pressuring Amy to act against her professional responsibilities. Even if they believe Jane is guilty, the justice system allows for a fair defense. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal decision, but is it wrong? Well, the author's motivation is based on a misunderstanding of Amy's role. They're punishing her for doing her job correctly. \n\nHowever, the author also has the right to set boundaries in their personal relationships. If Amy's actions conflict with the author's values to the point of breaking trust, cutting contact might be seen as a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. But the initial assumption is that the author is in the right to expect Amy to act in a certain way, which is not how the legal system works. \n\nSo, the author is wrong in expecting Amy to not do her job properly. They're misapplying their moral stance to a legal matter. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
