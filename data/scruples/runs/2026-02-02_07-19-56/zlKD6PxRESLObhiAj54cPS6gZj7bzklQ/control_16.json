We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for cutting off their sister (Amy) because she's defending their other sister (Jane), who's guilty of fraud.\n\nFirst, the author has a complicated relationship with Jane, who has a history of bad behavior. The author believes Jane is guilty and wants her to face consequences. Amy, as a defense attorney, is representing Jane but not trying to prove her guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't pursuing a guilty outcome, even though they agree Jane is guilty. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't \"do the right thing,\" which leads to Amy cutting contact.\n\nNow, considering legal ethics: defense attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, regardless of the client's guilt. This is a cornerstone of the legal system to ensure fair trials. If Amy is doing her job properly, she's not there to prove guilt but to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane convicted, but that's not Amy's role. The author's threat to cut off Amy is based on a misunderstanding of her professional duty.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are understandable given Jane's actions. But the author's decision to cut off Amy is based on personal ethics conflicting with Amy's professional obligations. The key point is whether the author is wrong to do this. Since Amy is acting within her professional role, the author's anger towards her might be misplaced. The author is not in the wrong for being upset, but perhaps they are wrong to cut Amy off over this, as it's part of Amy's job. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions (threatening to cut off contact) are justified. Since Amy is doing her job, and the author is punishing her for that, the author might be in the wrong. But the answer isn't straightforward. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're reacting to their sister's professional choices in a personal matter. However, the author's misunderstanding of legal roles might mean they are in the wrong. But the main issue is the ethics of cutting someone off. Given that Amy's actions are professional and the author's reaction is based on personal morals conflicting with her job, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check again. The author's threat is based on Amy's job performance, which is not their place to dictate. So perhaps the author is in the wrong because they're interfering in a professional matter. Hmm. The answer could be A or B. Let me think again.\n\nThe author believes Amy is not doing the right thing by not trying to get Jane convicted, but Amy's duty is to defend Jane, not to prove her guilt. The author is angry because Amy is doing her job, which the author doesn't support. The author's decision to cut off Amy is because of Amy's professional conduct in a case. So, the author is punishing Amy for doing her job, which is not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
