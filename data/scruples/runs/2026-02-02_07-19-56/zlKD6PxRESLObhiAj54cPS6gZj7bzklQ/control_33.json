We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves their sister Jane being arrested for fraud, and their other sister Amy, a lawyer, defending her pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is trying to win the case, which the author sees as unethical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. As a defense attorney, Amy's role is to defend her client, not to determine guilt. Even if Jane is guilty, Amy's job is to ensure the justice system works correctly, challenging the prosecution's case. The author might argue that Amy should act on her belief of Jane's guilt, but legally, that's not her responsibility. So Amy's actions might be within her professional duty.\n\nThen there's the personal relationship angle. The author is cutting contact over this, which is a significant decision. The question is whether the author is wrong to do so. The author feels betrayed because Amy isn't supporting the family's moral stance. But Amy might see her actions as her professional obligation and personal ambition. The author's reaction is intense, but is it justified? It depends on whether the author's expectations of Amy are reasonable. The author expects Amy to prioritize family ethics over her career, which might be a conflict of personal and professional roles.\n\nAlso, the author's judgment of Jane as guilty and Amy's lack of effort to prove guilt might stem from different perspectives. The author might not understand the legal nuances, like the burden of proof being on the prosecution. Amy's approach could be strategic, not unethical. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is cutting ties over Amy's professional decisions that are within her legal obligations, then the author might be overreacting. However, the author's feelings about Jane's actions are valid, and the family conflict is real. The key point is whether the author's expectations are reasonable. Since a defense attorney's role isn't to secure a guilty verdict but to defend the case, the author might be misjudging Amy's actions. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting Amy's professional role and for cutting contact based on that.\n"
