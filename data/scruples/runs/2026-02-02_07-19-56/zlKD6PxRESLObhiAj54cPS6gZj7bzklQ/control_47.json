We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their sister Jane being arrested for fraud, and their younger sister Amy, an attorney, defending her pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is aiming to win the case, even if Jane is guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Amy is a defense attorney, so her job is to represent Jane to the best of her ability, regardless of her personal beliefs about Jane's guilt. This is a fundamental principle of the legal system\u2014attorneys must provide zealous representation to their clients. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to secure a guilty verdict, but from a legal standpoint, Amy's role is to defend Jane, not to prosecute her. \n\nThe author's main issue is with Amy's approach, which they see as unethical. However, Amy's actions might be within professional boundaries. She's not lying but using the evidence to get a better outcome for her client. The author wants Amy to act in the interest of justice as they perceive it, but the legal system requires defense attorneys to protect the rights of the accused, even if they believe the client is guilty. \n\nThere's also a family dynamic here. The author feels betrayed because Amy is choosing to represent Jane in a way that the author sees as unjust. However, Amy is making a professional decision that affects her career. The author's threat to cut contact might be a strong reaction, but it's their choice based on their moral stance.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They aren't violating any laws, but their judgment of Amy's actions might stem from a misunderstanding of legal ethics. Amy is doing her job as an attorney, even if it conflicts with the family's moral views. The author's reaction is personal, but whether they're wrong depends on whether they overstepped by cutting contact. However, the question is about if the author is in the wrong, not if Amy is.\n\nSince the author isn't legally or ethically at fault for their personal feelings and actions towards their sister, the answer would be B (No). The author isn't wrong for holding their moral stance and choosing to distance themselves from Amy's professional decisions, even if those decisions are legally appropriate.\n"
