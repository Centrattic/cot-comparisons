We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister, Jane, is accused of fraud. Their younger sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who's representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane even though Jane is clearly guilty, according to the author. The author wants Amy to ensure Jane's guilt is proven and maybe get her prison time, but Amy is focused on winning the case regardless of ethics, even if Jane is guilty. The author threatened to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right\" thing, and Amy got angry.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The choices are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should break it down. The author's reasoning is that Amy is being unethical by defending someone they both know is guilty. The author believes Amy should act to ensure justice, but Amy is prioritizing her career and winning. The author is considering cutting off Amy for this.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, defense attorneys have a duty to defend their clients, even if they believe the client is guilty. The principle is that everyone is innocent until proven guilty, and the defense's role is to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. So Amy's actions might be within professional ethics, even if the author disagrees morally.\n\nOn the personal side, the author is cutting off a family member over professional ethics. That's a personal choice. The author might feel justified because of Jane's past behavior and the family's strained relationship. However, cutting off a sister is a major action, but it's their choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making that decision based on their values.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong. Since the author's actions are based on their own moral judgment and they're choosing to cut ties, it's their personal decision. The fact that Amy is doing her job as an attorney doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for disapproving. However, the author might not consider the professional obligations Amy has as a lawyer. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by cutting off Amy. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal choice based on their values, and Amy is acting within her professional role.\n"
