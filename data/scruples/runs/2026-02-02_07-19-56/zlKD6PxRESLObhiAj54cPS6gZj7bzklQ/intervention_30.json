We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, over her decisions regarding their other sister Jane's legal case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's sister Jane committed fraud, and she's being defended by Amy, the other sister. The author believes Jane is guilty and that Amy should be helping to prove her guilt. However, Amy is determined to defend Jane aggressively, even if it means getting her acquitted despite knowing she's guilty. The author is upset with Amy's approach and has decided to cut her off if she doesn't \"do the right thing.\"\n\nSo, the main points are: Jane is guilty, Amy is representing her, the author is frustrated Amy isn't helping to convict Jane, and decides to cut her off. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, Amy's job as an attorney is to defend her client to the best of her ability. Even if she knows the client is guilty, lawyers are ethically bound to provide a vigorous defense. The American Bar Association's model rules of professional conduct state that a lawyer must zealously represent their client within the bounds of the law. So Amy's actions are within her professional responsibilities.\n\nThe author is upset because they feel Amy is being unethical. But in reality, Amy is doing her job correctly. The author's expectation that Amy should help convict Jane is incorrect. Lawyers can't act as prosecutors; their role is to ensure justice is served by challenging the prosecution's case, not to prove guilt unless the client confesses.\n\nThe author is punishing Amy for doing her job, which is a conflict between personal feelings and professional ethics. The author's decision to cut off Amy is based on their disagreement with her professional conduct, but that's not Amy's fault. The author's moral judgment here is misplaced because they're conflating personal moral views with professional duty.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy might be crossing ethical lines if she's actively trying to subvert justice, but the scenario doesn't mention any misconduct. She's just doing her job, even if it's for someone the author finds morally reprehensible.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they're cutting off a family member for fulfilling her professional role. The answer should be A (the author is in the wrong) because Amy is acting within her legal ethics, and the author's reaction is based on misunderstanding her professional obligations.\n"
