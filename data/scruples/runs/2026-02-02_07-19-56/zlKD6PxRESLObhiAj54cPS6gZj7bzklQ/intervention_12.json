We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her choices as an attorney. The scenario involves the author's sister Jane being arrested for fraud, and the other sister Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney, representing her pro bono.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. The author has a strained relationship with Jane, who they believe is guilty without a doubt. The author is upset that Amy is defending Jane, even though Amy admits Jane is guilty but chooses not to pursue a guilty plea because of lack of evidence. The author feels Amy is being unethical as a defense attorney, prioritizing winning over justice, and cutting her off because of that.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ethical dilemma of an attorney's duty to their client versus personal morals, the author's feelings about their sister's actions, and whether cutting off a sibling is justified.\n\nIn the legal context, defense attorneys are supposed to protect their clients' rights and ensure a fair trial, even if they believe the client is guilty. It's part of the adversarial system. Amy is doing her job by trying to get the best possible outcome for Jane, which is her role as an attorney. However, the author is upset because Amy isn't using her position to secure a guilty verdict but is instead aiming to get Jane off, which might seem morally conflicting to the author.\n\nNow, the author's decision to cut off Amy is based on disapproving of her professional choices. But is that the author's right? They have a personal relationship with Amy, and while they might be upset, cutting off a family member is a significant action. The question is whether the author overstepped by pressuring Amy to act against her professional ethics.\n\nAmy's response suggests she sees her actions as part of her career strategy and success, which could be a valid perspective. The author might not realize that a defense attorney's job isn't to prove guilt but to ensure the prosecution's case is airtight and to protect the client from unjust punishment.\n\nHowever, the author might feel betrayed because Amy is helping someone (Jane) they consider undeserving. But Amy's actions are within professional boundaries. The author's disapproval is personal, but it doesn't necessarily make Amy wrong in her role.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If Amy is doing her job by defending Jane, even if she knows Jane is guilty, then the author is holding Amy to a higher ethical standard than her professional duties require. The author might be in the right to feel upset, but cutting off a sister over professional ethics might be too harsh. Alternatively, if the author believes Amy is acting unethically (like manipulating the system), then Amy could be at fault. But based on the information, Amy is just fulfilling her legal responsibilities. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off Amy over her professional decisions, even if they disagree with them.\n"
