We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author cutting off their sister Amy because she's defending their other sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, even though they both agree Jane is guilty. Amy is using her position as an attorney to defend Jane pro bono, and the author feels betrayed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal ethics. As an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of personal feelings or whether she believes the client is guilty. It's part of the legal system's structure to ensure a fair trial. So Amy is doing her job by not trying to prove her sister guilty. \n\nThe author, on the other hand, is cutting off Amy because they disagree with her professional decisions. The author might feel hurt that Amy isn't taking the moral stance they expect, especially given their complicated family dynamics. However, Amy's choice to defend her sister, even if she believes her guilty, might be her way of navigating her career and personal relationships. \n\nIs the author right to cut her off? Well, Amy is within her rights and professional obligations to defend Jane. The author might not like Amy's approach, but legally, Amy is doing what she should. The author's reaction is based on personal morals and family expectations, but Amy's actions are professional. \n\nThe author might be projecting their own values onto Amy, expecting her to act a certain way in a situation where Amy has her own motivations. However, the author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as extreme, but maybe justified in their own eyes because they feel Amy isn't doing the \"right\" thing. \n\nOn the other hand, Amy might be facing her own challenges, like gender bias in her firm, and using this case as a way to prove herself. The author might not consider that Amy's motivations are more complex than just wanting to help Jane. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. The author isn't wrong for having strong feelings about the situation, but maybe they are wrong in cutting off Amy because Amy is simply doing her job. The legal system requires that defense attorneys do their job, even if they believe the client is guilty. The author's personal values might be clashing with Amy's professional duties. Therefore, the author's punishment (cutting off) might be too harsh, so they could be in the right in their feelings but in the wrong in their action. Alternatively, if Amy is using the case to further her career unethically, there might be grounds for the author's frustration. But since Amy is following legal procedures, the author's reaction might be unwarranted.\n"
