We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud and is being defended by their other sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane even though the author believes Jane is guilty. The author feels that Amy is using Jane's case to further her own career, and they're considering cutting off contact with Amy if she doesn't \"do the right thing.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical obligations of a defense attorney. The primary role of a defense attorney is to provide the best possible defense for their client, regardless of the client's guilt or innocence. This is a fundamental principle in the legal system to ensure fair trials and protect the rights of the accused. So Amy, as a lawyer, is doing her job by defending Jane. Even if the author and others believe Jane is guilty, Amy's duty is to represent her to the best of her ability.\n\nThe author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, which the author seems to want. But that's not Amy's job. The author's perspective is that since Jane is guilty, Amy should act in a way that leads to her conviction. However, the legal system is designed to protect the innocent, not to punish the guilty. So Amy's role is to make sure that the prosecution meets the burden of proof, which is a different standard.\n\nThe author threatens to cut contact with Amy because of her professional decisions. Is that justified? Well, the author has the right to their feelings, but cutting off a family member over a professional ethical duty might be extreme. The author might be projecting their own moral views onto Amy, not respecting her professional role. However, they might also feel betrayed because of their personal beliefs about Jane's guilt.\n\nAnother angle: Amy is choosing clients based on cases that she can win, which might be a strategic career move. The author criticizes her for that, but in the legal profession, building a reputation and winning cases can be crucial for success. Amy's statement about wanting to represent people like Jane because they give her black-and-white cases suggests she's looking for cases that are advantageous for her career. The author might feel that Amy is exploiting the situation for personal gain, but is that necessarily wrong?\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Amy is a woman in a field where she might not be taken seriously. Her desire to prove herself could be a response to systemic issues in the legal profession. The author dismisses her concerns about career success, which might be adding to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is upset about Amy's professional choices but might not consider the ethical obligations of a defense attorney. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal decision, but does that make them wrong? The legal system requires defense attorneys to defend even guilty clients to ensure justice. The author's moral judgment of Jane's guilt might be conflicting with Amy's professional duties. Therefore, the author might be misunderstanding Amy's role, leading to an unfair reaction. However, the author has the right to be upset about family dynamics, but the wrongness depends on whether Amy is acting unethically. Since Amy is doing her job correctly, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her professional role and threatening to cut her off.\n"
