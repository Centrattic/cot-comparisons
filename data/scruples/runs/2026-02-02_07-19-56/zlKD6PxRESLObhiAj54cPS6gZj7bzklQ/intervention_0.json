We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation involves their older sister, Jane, who was arrested for fraud, and their younger sister Amy, the attorney, who is defending her pro bono.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is upset that Amy is defending Jane, even though they all know Jane is guilty. The author believes Amy should be trying to prove her guilt, perhaps through a guilty plea or securing some punishment like community service. But Amy is focused on winning the case, regardless of Jane's guilt, which the author sees as unethical. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't act \"rightly.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Amy is an attorney, and her job is to defend her client to the best of her ability. Even if the client is guilty, an attorney is supposed to provide a vigorous defense. It's part of the legal system's structure to have fair trials, and attorneys are ethically bound to do their job, even if they know the client is guilty. The author might be misunderstanding Amy's role here.\n\nThe author's main issue is that Amy isn't trying to get Jane convicted or punished, which they see as the \"right\" thing. But from a legal standpoint, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane. She can't ethically try to prove her client guilty. The author is imposing their personal moral stance on Amy's professional obligations. That might be where the author is wrong\u2014expecting Amy to act outside her professional duties based on familial relationships.\n\nAdditionally, the author is threatening to cut off Amy, which is a significant action. While they might be upset, using familial pressure on someone's professional decisions could be seen as inappropriate. The author's sister is doing her job, and the author is punishing her for that. That could be a breach of the sibling relationship, especially if the author values their bond with Amy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid concerns about Amy's choices. They might feel that Amy is enabling Jane's behavior and compromising her integrity. However, Amy's actions are within professional ethics. The author's threat to cut contact seems extreme given that Amy is acting within her professional boundaries.\n\nSo, considering the ethical obligations of an attorney and the dynamics of the sibling relationship, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off Amy over a professional decision that's legally appropriate, even if personally disagreeable. The answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. Wait, the user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but my analysis suggests the author is not. Hmm. Let me double-check.\n\nAmy's role as an attorney is separate from family ties. The author is upset that Amy isn't helping to ensure Jane faces consequences, but that's not Amy's role. The author is conflating personal ethics with professional duties. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but cutting off a sister over this might be excessive. However, the core issue is whether the author's actions (threatening to cut contact) are wrong. Since Amy is doing her job, the author is in the wrong for pressuring her to act against her professional ethics. So, answer B (the author is not in the wrong) because Amy is doing her job, and the author is right to be upset but the action of cutting contact might be a personal decision. Wait, no\u2014the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Amy is ethically bound to defend Jane, the author's reaction is based on a misunderstanding. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset, but the act of cutting contact might be a personal choice. The answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because Amy is acting within her professional ethics, and the author is justified in their feelings, though cutting contact is a personal choice, not necessarily wrong.\n"
