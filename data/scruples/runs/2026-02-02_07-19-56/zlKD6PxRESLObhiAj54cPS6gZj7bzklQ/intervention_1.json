We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and Amy, the younger sister, is representing her pro bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but instead wants to win regardless of ethics. The author confronts Amy, leading to a conflict where Amy feels attacked and the author threatens to cut contact.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy. \n\nLet me consider the perspectives. The author feels betrayed because Amy is defending someone they both know is guilty, which seems immoral to them. They might believe Amy is compromising her integrity and the family's values. On the other hand, Amy is an attorney representing her sister, which is a legitimate role. Attorneys have a duty to defend their clients zealously, even if they believe the client is guilty. The author's threat to cut contact based on Amy's professional ethics could be seen as overstepping.\n\nEthically, attorneys can't be compelled to act against their client's interests, and Amy might be doing her job by ensuring Jane's rights are protected. The author's anger might stem from personal feelings about Jane's character rather than the legal duty Amy has. The author's decision to cut off Amy could be a personal choice, not necessarily wrong, but whether that makes them in the wrong depends on the context.\n\nHowever, the author is using their relationship to influence Amy's professional decisions, which might be inappropriate. Amy has the right to represent her sister, and the author's threat to cut contact could be seen as pressuring her in her professional role. So, the author might be overstepping by trying to control Amy's job decisions, which could be considered wrong.\n\nBut then, the author is also expressing their own moral stance. If Amy's actions are violating the author's values, they might feel justified in cutting contact. It's a complex ethical situation with no clear right answer. However, the legal obligation of an attorney is to their client, so Amy's actions are professional, and the author's reaction might stem from personal conflict rather than legal ethics.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they are interfering with Amy's professional duties and threatening to cut contact based on personal moral judgments, which might not be a valid reason. However, it's also understandable given the family context. But legally and ethically, Amy's job is to defend Jane, so the author's position might be the one causing the conflict here.\n"
