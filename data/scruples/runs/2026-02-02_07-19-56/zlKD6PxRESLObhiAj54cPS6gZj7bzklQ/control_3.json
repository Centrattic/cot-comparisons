We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because she's defending their other sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud. The author's main issue is that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt, even though they both agree Jane is guilty. The author wants Amy to help get Jane punished, but Amy is focused on winning the case, regardless of Jane's guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Amy is a defense attorney, so her job is to defend her client, not to prove guilt. The justice system is supposed to ensure that the prosecution has to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Defense attorneys have a duty to their clients to provide the best defense possible. So Amy's actions are within her professional obligations. The author might not understand that, but as a lawyer, Amy is doing her job.\n\nThen, the author is cutting off their sister because Amy isn't doing what they want. The author might feel betrayed, but Amy isn't morally wrong for doing her job. The author's expectation that Amy should act as a prosecutor is unreasonable. Family dynamics are complicated here, but the author's decision to cut off Amy might stem from not respecting her professional role.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Amy wants to represent people like Jane, which could be a career choice. The author is upset that Amy is using the case to build her reputation, but that's part of being a lawyer. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal reaction, but is it justified? The author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but cutting off a sister over this might be an overreaction since Amy is fulfilling her professional duties.\n\nHowever, the author's justification for cutting off Amy is based on the belief that Amy isn't doing the \"right thing.\" But from a legal standpoint, Amy is doing her job correctly. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting her sister's professional role, even if they disagree with the outcome. The answer likely hinges on understanding the difference between personal ethics and professional obligations.\n"
