We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about the author cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's older sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. They're already estranged, and the younger sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who's taking Jane's case pro bono. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty and think Amy is helping her avoid consequences. They confronted Amy, but Amy is focused on winning the case regardless of ethics, and the author threatened to cut off contact if she doesn't \"do the right thing.\" Now they're asking if they're the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Amy is an attorney representing her sister. Attorneys have a duty to their clients, even if they suspect guilt. They can't be compelled to act against their client's interests. The author is judging Amy for doing her job, even though they both acknowledge Jane is guilty. The author's threat to cut off contact is based on disapproval of professional conduct. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, attorney-client confidentiality is a legal obligation. Even if the author thinks Amy is being unethical, Amy is just doing her job. The author has a right to be upset, but cutting off contact because they disagree with a legal professional's role might not be justified. However, the author's own judgment of Jane's guilt is personal. The problem is the author is pressuring their sister to do what they see as the \"right\" thing legally, but that's not how the legal system works. \n\nSo, legally speaking, Amy isn't in the wrong for defending her client. The author's reaction is based on personal morals clashing with the legal system's requirements. The author might be in the right to feel frustrated, but they're wrong to cut off a family member over this. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case. Wait, the author is cutting off contact because they disagree with legal representation choices. But Amy has a duty to her client, so the author's anger might be misplaced. So maybe the author is wrong to cut off their sister because they don't have the authority to dictate how she does her job. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, no. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is making a personal choice based on their values, but Amy is doing her job, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. However, the answer depends on whether the author overstepped. Cutting off family is a personal choice, but if they're pressuring Amy to not fulfill her professional duties, that's problematic. But the author isn't pressuring her; they're just cutting contact. So the author is not in the wrong for their own choice, even if they're wrong in their judgment. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're holding their sister to a personal standard that conflicts with her professional obligations. So, the answer could be B (No). Because the author is not in the wrong for their feelings, but perhaps they are in the wrong for cutting off their sister based on a misunderstanding of legal ethics. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer is B because Amy's role is to defend her client, and the author is not in the wrong for their reaction, even if they are wrong in their perspective. But the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. So the correct answer is B (No). Because the author isn't in the wrong for their personal choice to cut contact, given their feelings about their sister's actions.\n"
