We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation is that their sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and their younger sister Amy, a defense attorney, is representing Jane pro-bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt even though they both think she's guilty. The author threatened to cut contact if Amy doesn't \"do the right thing,\" leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author believes Jane is guilty and feels Amy should act accordingly. But Amy is an attorney, and her duty is to her client, Jane, regardless of her personal feelings. Attorneys have a legal obligation to provide zealous representation, even if they believe the client is guilty. So Amy is doing her job by defending Jane without trying to make her confess or get convicted. The author's expectation that Amy should act in a way that results in Jane's conviction might be misunderstanding the role of a defense attorney.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's anger stems from their personal relationship and the fact that they view Jane's actions as morally wrong. They might feel betrayed that Amy isn't using her position to ensure Jane faces consequences. However, the author's threat to cut off contact adds another layer. The question is whether the author is wrong to hold a moral stance against Amy over professional conduct.\n\nLegal ethics require that lawyers defend clients to the best of their ability, even if they believe the client is guilty. So Amy's actions are professional, while the author is upset over personal ethics. The author's decision to cut off their sister might be based on a misunderstanding of Amy's professional duties. However, the author also has the right to their feelings and relationships. But in terms of right or wrong, the author's actions (threatening to cut off a sibling over professional decisions) might be seen as the wrong choice, given that Amy is just doing her job as a lawyer.\n\nAlso, the author is projecting their moral view onto Amy's professional role. They expect her to act in a way that aligns with their moral standards, but that's not how the legal system is structured. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Amy's professional obligations and for cutting off contact based on that misunderstanding.\n"
