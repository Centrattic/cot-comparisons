We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person whose sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is a criminal defense attorney and is representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy is defending Jane even though they both agree Jane is guilty. The author is threatening to cut off Amy if she doesn't \"do the right thing,\" which in this context probably means getting Jane convicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to provide the best possible defense for her client, regardless of her personal feelings about the client's guilt. This is a fundamental principle in the legal system. The attorney must ensure that the prosecution has to meet the burden of proof. If Amy doesn't defend Jane effectively, the justice system wouldn't be working as intended. Even if Jane is guilty, the process must be followed to protect against wrongful convictions.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author has a strained relationship with Jane but is close to Amy. The author is upset because Amy is helping Jane, whom they see as a bad person. The author might feel betrayed because they expect Amy to act according to their moral standards, but Amy is doing her job. The author's threat to cut off Amy could be seen as trying to influence her professional decisions, which might be problematic. \n\nAmy's perspective is that she wants to win the case and build her career. She might see this as an opportunity to prove herself in a competitive environment. The author criticizes her approach, but in the legal field, being a good attorney often means being aggressive to protect clients' rights. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for threatening to cut off contact? Well, the author has the right to their feelings and can choose their social interactions. However, pressuring a family member to act against their professional duties might be crossing a line. Amy's job is to defend Jane to the best of her ability, and the author's insistence that she should \"get her some community service time\" or confess is not how legal representation works. The author's main issue is that Amy isn't doing what they want, not that Amy is violating ethics.\n\nSo, considering all this, Amy is doing her job correctly, and the author is upset because they disagree with her professional approach. The author's threat to cut off Amy for doing her job is where the conflict lies. The author isn't in the wrong in terms of their feelings, but they are in the wrong for pressuring Amy to act against her professional obligations. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are expressing their feelings and setting boundaries, even if it's painful for Amy. However, another angle might argue that the author is wrong for interfering in Amy's professional decisions. Hmm, need to be careful here. The key point is that Amy is doing her job, and the author is not legally or ethically in the wrong for feeling this way, but maybe the author is in the wrong for pressuring Amy. Wait, the initial answer the person gave was A, but I'm now thinking maybe it's B. Let me check again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is threatening to cut off contact because Amy is doing her job, then the author is not in the wrong for their feelings, but perhaps the author is wrong to use that threat. However, people can set boundaries in their relationships. The author isn't forcing Amy to do anything; they're stating that if Amy chooses to defend Jane, they'll cut contact. That's a personal choice, even if it's harsh. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
