We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation is that their sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and Amy, the attorney, is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset that Amy is defending Jane even though they both know Jane is guilty. The author wants Amy to ensure Jane is convicted, but Amy is focused on winning the case regardless of Jane's guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. As an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane, to provide the best possible defense. Even if Jane is guilty, the legal system expects lawyers to zealously represent their clients. The author seems to think Amy should prioritize justice over winning, but that's not how the legal system works. Attorneys can't ethically try to prove guilt if they're acting as defenders. So Amy's actions are within her professional responsibilities.\n\nThe author is cutting off Amy for doing her job as expected. That could be seen as a conflict of interest in their personal relationship. The author might be projecting their own moral views onto Amy, expecting her to act against her professional obligations. The question is whether the author is wrong to cut off Amy for this. \n\nOn one hand, the author is frustrated with Amy's choices, possibly because they believe Amy is enabling Jane's behavior. On the other hand, Amy is doing her job, and the author is imposing personal morals on a legal role. The author might be in the wrong for expecting Amy to act against her professional duties, which are separate from personal feelings. \n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. They might feel betrayed by Amy, especially since they're close. But the key point is whether Amy is ethically bound to defend Jane regardless of guilt. Since she is, the author's reaction might not be justified. The author is cutting off a family member over a professional decision, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. Wait, but earlier reasoning suggested that Amy is doing her job, so the author is wrong to cut her off. Wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but now I'm confused. Let me re-express. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy. If the author is wrong for cutting Amy off because Amy is doing her job as an attorney, then the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) if the author is right. Wait, no. If the author is correct in their reasoning, then they are not in the wrong. But if the author is wrong in their reasoning, then they are in the wrong. \n\nThe author believes Amy should do the \"right\" thing (convict Jane) but Amy is doing her job. So the author is wrong to cut her off because Amy is fulfilling her professional duties. Therefore, the answer would be B (author not in the wrong) if the author is correct, but since the author is wrong in expecting Amy to act against her role, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). Wait, this is confusing. Let me clarify.\n\nIf Amy is doing her job correctly, then the author is wrong to cut her off. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy because they are holding her to a personal moral standard that conflicts with her professional obligations. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Wait, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong but they want to know if that's correct. So, the correct answer here would be A if the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the author has the right to be upset but is not in the wrong for cutting off Amy because they have the right to set boundaries, maybe B. But in the legal system, attorneys must defend even guilty clients, so the author's expectation is unrealistic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy for doing her job. So answer A.\n"
