We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's older sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The younger sister, Amy, is a criminal defense attorney and chose to represent her pro-bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but instead wants to win the case regardless of Jane's guilt. The author threatens to cut off contact if Amy doesn't act \"rightly,\" and Amy gets defensive, saying she's fighting for her career and recognition in a male-dominated field.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the assistant's take.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is upset about their sister defending someone they believe deserves punishment. They see Amy as prioritizing her career over morals. On the other hand, Amy is doing her job as an attorney, which is to defend her client to the best of her ability, even if she believes the client is guilty. Attorneys have an ethical duty to their client, not to the prosecution or family members.\n\nThe author's threat to cut off contact because of Amy's professional decisions might be seen as overstepping. Cutting someone off for doing their job, even if you disagree with their ethical stance, could be harsh. However, the author is also part of a family with a history of strained relationships, and they have personal reasons for disliking Jane's behavior.\n\nBut legally and ethically, an attorney must represent their client zealously. Amy's role is to defend Jane, not to ensure the guilty are punished. The author's moral judgment might not align with the legal system's principles. The author's reaction could be seen as pressuring a legal professional to act outside their duties, which isn't appropriate.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off their sister over professional ethics. However, there's the aspect of family values and personal ethics. But in the context of legal representation, the author's actions might not hold up as justified. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they have a right to their feelings and family boundaries, even if it leads to cutting off a sister. Wait, but maybe that's not the case. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're taking a moral stance against their sister's legal profession. Attorneys are supposed to defend clients regardless of guilt. The author's threat to cut off contact for fulfilling her job duties isn't justified. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Which is it?\n\nI think the key point is that Amy is doing her job, and the author is pressuring her to abandon her professional duties for personal reasons. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister over her professional conduct. So answer A.\n"
