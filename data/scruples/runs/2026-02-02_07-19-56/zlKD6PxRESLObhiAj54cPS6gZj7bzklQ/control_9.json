We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author's older sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, a defense attorney, is representing Jane pro bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and that Amy isn't doing her job to get Jane's guilt proven, but instead is trying to win the case regardless of Jane's guilt. The author is upset that Amy is defending Jane not to find the truth but to win, and this leads them to consider cutting ties with Amy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nAmy is a professional attorney. Her job is to provide the best defense for her client, Jane, regardless of her personal beliefs about Jane's guilt. This is a fundamental principle in the legal system\u2014attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, even if they personally believe the client is guilty. So Amy is doing her job correctly here. The author is upset because they want Amy to act more as a moral enforcer rather than a defense attorney.\n\nBut Amy has a professional obligation to her client. If she were to act on her personal belief that Jane is guilty, that would be a conflict of interest and unprofessional. The author, however, might not understand this distinction. The author sees Amy as being unethical for not trying to prove Jane guilty, but in reality, Amy is doing her job by trying to get the best possible outcome for Jane, which is a defense attorney's role.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off contact with Amy is based on personal moral disagreements with Amy's professional conduct. However, Amy's actions are within professional ethics. The author is not wrong for being upset about their sister's actions, but cutting off a sibling over professional duties might be an overreaction. The author might be conflating personal morals with professional ethics here.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's statement about wanting to represent the next O.J. Simpson and her approach to the case could be unprofessional or unethical if she's being deceptive, but the scenario doesn't say that she's doing anything illegal. It's possible that Amy is just being ambitious and competitive, which isn't necessarily wrong if she's following legal procedures.\n\nSo, the author's frustration is understandable given their belief in Jane's guilt, but the legal system requires that defense attorneys do their job regardless of personal feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but cutting off a sister over professional boundaries might not be justified. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Amy is fulfilling her professional role, the author's decision to cut contact might be seen as a personal choice, not a moral wrong. Thus, the answer is B (No).\n"
