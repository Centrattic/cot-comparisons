We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because she's defending their guilty sister Jane. The author believes Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but is instead trying to win the case regardless of ethics.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane is clearly guilty of fraud. Amy, the younger sister and attorney, is representing Jane, even though she knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane to confess or face consequences. They argue that Amy is being unethical by defending a guilty client, and Amy is doing it for her career, not for Jane's sake.\n\nThe author is cutting off Amy because of her decisions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, author is in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nI should consider the legal ethics here. As an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane, regardless of her personal feelings or the client's guilt. It's part of the legal system that defense attorneys must zealously represent their clients. Even if the client is guilty, the attorney's role is to ensure that the prosecution meets its burden of proof. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, but that's not Amy's job. Her job is to defend Jane, which includes challenging the prosecution's case, not proving guilt.\n\nSo, the author is cutting off Amy for doing her job. That seems like an overreaction. The author might not understand the role of a defense attorney, thinking that the attorney should ensure the guilty person is punished, but in reality, the system relies on defense attorneys to protect the rights of all clients, which helps prevent wrongful convictions.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of Amy's motivations. She wants to be successful and take on high-profile cases, even if it means representing someone guilty. The author might feel that Amy is exploiting the situation for her career, which could be a point of contention. But legally, that's her right as an attorney. The author's frustration is understandable, but cutting off a sibling over professional ethics might be too harsh a response.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in the wrong for having strong feelings about Jane's actions. But using family relationships as leverage because of ethical disagreements in professional matters might not be fair. The author is prioritizing their moral stance over their sister's career choices, which is a personal decision but not necessarily wrong. However, cutting off contact is a significant step, and whether it's justified depends on the depth of the conflict and the relationship's health.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions stem from a misunderstanding of the defense attorney's role and the legal system's principles. While Amy is doing her job, the author's response might be too extreme. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're acting on their moral beliefs. But since Amy is fulfilling her professional duties, the author's cutting off might be an overreaction. The answer could be B (the author is not in the wrong) because Amy is acting within her professional role, but the author's reaction is a personal choice based on their values.\n"
