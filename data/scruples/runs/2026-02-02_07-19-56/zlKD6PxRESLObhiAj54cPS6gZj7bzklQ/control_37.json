We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. Jane's sister Amy, a criminal defense attorney, is representing her pro-bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but instead is focused on winning, even if it means getting Jane off. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't act \"rightly,\" and Amy is upset, saying the author is too nice and wants to complicate things.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author's actions stem from a belief that Amy is not acting ethically by defending Jane without trying to convict her. But as an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to prove guilt. Attorneys have a duty to represent their clients zealously within the bounds of the law, regardless of the client's guilt. Even if the client is family, the attorney must follow professional ethics. However, there's a line about conflicts of interest, but since Amy is doing it pro-bono and the matter is with the family, maybe there's an issue there. But generally, an attorney can take on any client they choose.\n\nThe author is cutting off Amy because of her professional decisions, which Amy sees as a breach of their relationship. The author feels justified because they believe Jane is guilty, while Amy is doing her job. The question is whether the author is wrong for cutting ties over this.\n\nEthically, the author might not be in the wrong if they feel that Amy's actions compromise her integrity or family values. However, Amy is performing her professional duties as expected. The author's decision could be seen as a personal choice based on their values. On the other hand, Amy's actions are within her professional role. The author might be overstepping by pressuring her to act against her professional obligations. \n\nBut the author is not the one in the wrong for having a different perspective. They are justified in their feelings, but whether they are in the wrong for cutting off contact depends on the context. Since the author is making a personal choice based on their values, and Amy is doing her job as expected, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are choosing to prioritize their moral stance over family ties. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
