We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's older sister Jane was arrested for fraud and is clearly guilty, according to everyone, including Amy. Amy, the younger sister and a criminal defense attorney, is representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane convicted but instead is focusing on winning the case, even if Jane is guilty. The author thinks Amy is unethical and threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't \"do the right thing.\" Amy responds defensively, saying it's her career choice and she wants to be successful.\n\nNow, the key points here: The author is cutting off their sister because Amy is doing her job, which they disagree with. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to prove guilt. The attorney's role is to ensure the client gets a fair trial, even if they think the client is guilty. This is a fundamental principle of the legal system. The author, however, sees this as unethical because they believe Amy is helping someone who is clearly guilty. \n\nBut from a personal relationship perspective, the author is frustrated with Amy's choices, especially given Jane's history. However, Amy is making a professional decision that's part of her job, which is to provide the best defense possible. The author is cutting off their sister over this, which is a significant action. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author has the right to be upset, but cutting off a sister over her professional decisions might be taking it too far. The author is imposing their moral judgment on Amy's professional conduct, which is separate from her personal life. Amy's choice to represent Jane is her career decision, even if the author disagrees with it. The author's reaction might stem from frustration with Jane's behavior and Amy's approach, but Amy is acting within her professional ethics.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be overstepping by cutting off Amy for doing her job. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are justified in feeling upset about their sister's actions, but maybe the answer leans towards B since the author's reaction is a personal choice based on their values, even if it's harsh.\n"
