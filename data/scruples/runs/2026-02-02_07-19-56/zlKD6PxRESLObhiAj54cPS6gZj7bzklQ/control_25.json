We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author cutting off their sister because the sister is representing their guilty older sister in court, even though the younger sister believes the client is guilty.\n\nFirst, let me recap the details. The author has two sisters: Jane, who's been arrested for fraud, and Amy, a defense attorney. Jane is clearly guilty, and Amy is representing her pro bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt, even though both agree Jane is guilty. Amy wants to win the case by any means necessary, which the author sees as unethical. The author threatened to cut contact if Amy doesn't act \"right,\" which Amy did, leading to a falling out. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for cutting contact.\n\nSo, the main points of contention here are the author's moral stance versus Amy's professional obligation as a lawyer. The author believes that as a defense attorney, Amy should do the morally right thing by ensuring Jane's guilt is proven, but in reality, a defense attorney's role is to protect the client's rights, not to prove guilt. The attorney's job is to provide a fair trial, not to ensure the client is convicted. Amy might be doing her job correctly by representing Jane to the best of her ability, within legal ethics, which is to secure the best possible outcome for her client, even if the client is guilty.\n\nThe author is frustrated because they think Amy should be trying to get Jane convicted, maybe even get her to confess. But in the legal system, a defense attorney isn't supposed to push for a confession that the client isn't willing to make. The attorney's role is to negotiate plea deals, challenge evidence, etc., not to confess on behalf of the client. So Amy's approach might be entirely within the bounds of professional ethics.\n\nAdditionally, the author is imposing their personal moral judgment onto Amy's professional conduct. Amy might have her own reasons for taking the case, like gaining experience, building her reputation, or personal motivations. The author's threat to cut contact over this could be seen as overstepping, as Amy has a right to her profession and decisions, even if they conflict with the family's moral views.\n\nThe author might be right in their belief that Jane is guilty and deserves consequences, but that doesn't mean Amy is wrong for doing her job. The legal system allows for defense attorneys to represent clients they know are guilty, as long as they follow ethical guidelines. So the author's anger and decision to cut contact could be based on a misunderstanding of the legal profession's role.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author is close to Amy and felt betrayed. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since Amy is acting within her professional role, the author's reaction might be justified in terms of family conflict but not in terms of the situation's rightness. The author isn't wrong for feeling hurt, but their decision to cut off contact might be extreme given that Amy is fulfilling her job duties.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but their actions might be too harsh because Amy is doing her job correctly. The answer here is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to check if the author is actually wrong in their judgment. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting contact. If the author's reasoning is based on a misunderstanding of Amy's role as a defense attorney, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if Amy is indeed acting unethically, then the author isn't. However, in the legal system, it's expected that defense attorneys do everything legally to defend their clients, even guilty ones. So Amy is doing her job, and the author is wrong for cutting contact because of that. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) if the author's actions are justified. Wait, no\u2014if the author is wrong in cutting contact because Amy is acting within her professional duties, then the author is in the wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So if the author cut contact based on a misunderstanding, then the author is in the wrong. Hmm.\n\nWait, the author's reasoning is that Amy is not doing the right thing by not trying to get Jane convicted. But Amy's job is to defend Jane, not to convict her. Therefore, the author is wrong in cutting contact because Amy is fulfilling her professional role correctly. So the author is in the wrong for cutting contact due to a misunderstanding of legal ethics. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). Wait, but the initial question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions stem from a misunderstanding of the legal profession, then they are in the wrong for cutting contact. But if Amy is indeed acting unethically, then the author isn't. The key is whether Amy's actions are within legal ethics. The scenario says Amy is a defense attorney, so her role is to defend Jane, not to convict her. Therefore, the author's cutting contact is based on a misunderstanding, making the author in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
