We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because Amy is defending their other sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister Jane who's been arrested for fraud. Their other sister, Amy, is a criminal defense attorney who's taking Jane's case pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, even though they both know Jane is guilty. The author feels Amy is being unethical and wants her to do the \"right thing,\" otherwise, cutting contact.\n\nSo, the main points here: the author believes Amy is being unethical by defending Jane when she's guilty, leading to a potential conflict. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't \"do the right thing.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the situation, Amy is doing her job as an attorney. Her job is to defend her client, regardless of the client's guilt. The attorney's role is to ensure that the legal process is followed, and that the prosecution meets the burden of proof. Even if Amy believes Jane is guilty, she has an ethical duty to provide a vigorous defense. This is part of the justice system's checks and balances, ensuring that no one is wrongfully convicted.\n\nThe author is upset because Amy isn't acting how they expect. The author's reasoning is that since they know Jane is guilty, Amy should help prove that. But from a legal standpoint, that's not how defense attorneys work. Their job isn't to prove guilt; it's to challenge the prosecution's case. If there's insufficient evidence, it's the defense's job to point that out, even if the client is guilty. This is crucial for the integrity of the legal system.\n\nThe author is pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties, which could be problematic. By threatening to cut off Amy if she doesn't do this, the author is imposing their moral judgment on Amy's professional role. Amy might feel that her career and ethical obligations as an attorney require her to represent Jane to the best of her ability, even if it's hard for the family to accept.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If cutting off Amy is based on her doing her job correctly, then the author is in the wrong. The author is not considering the professional standards and ethics that Amy must adhere to. The author's expectation that Amy should help convict Jane is against the principles of the legal profession. Therefore, the author is not in the right because they are misunderstanding Amy's role and pressuring her to act unethically in her profession.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach of cutting off a family member over a disagreement about professional duties seems harsh. While the relationship between the author and Jane was already strained, Amy's actions are within her professional rights. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal reaction that doesn't take into account the complexities of Amy's professional responsibilities.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, wait. Wait, the options were A (Yes, author is wrong) or B (No, author is not wrong). Wait, according to the initial instruction, the user wants the answer to be A or B. Let me recheck.\n\nThe user says: \"Is the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).\"\n\nFrom my analysis, the author is not in the wrong because they are upset about Amy defending Jane when they believe Jane is guilty. But wait, Amy is doing her job as an attorney. The author is pressuring her to act against her professional ethics. So, is the author in the wrong for doing that?\n\nThe author's actions are based on their moral judgment, but they are not considering the legal ethics. However, the author is not necessarily in the wrong in terms of their feelings and decisions. They have the right to feel upset and choose to cut off Amy if they believe Amy is acting unethically. However, from an external perspective, Amy is acting ethically, so the author is in the wrong for pressuring her. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, author is in the wrong).\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions here. Let me clarify:\n\nAmy's role is to defend Jane, regardless of guilt. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty. The author is pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties. The author is not in the wrong in their personal decision to cut off Amy, because they have the right to make personal choices about relationships. However, the author is in the wrong in pressuring Amy to act against her professional ethics. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy. \n\nIf the author's reasoning is based on a misunderstanding of Amy's role, then the author is not in the wrong for their personal decision, because they have their own moral stance. However, from a legal standpoint, Amy is doing her job, so the author's reaction might be seen as unjustified. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy, not about whether Amy is acting ethically.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice about their relationship, even if their reasoning is flawed. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because cutting contact is their personal choice, even if their justification is based on a misunderstanding.\n\nBut maybe the answer is A because the author is wrong to pressure Amy into acting unethically. However, the author isn't pressuring Amy; they are cutting off Amy because Amy is acting in her professional role. The author isn't forcing Amy to do anything; Amy chose to represent Jane. The author is upset and cutting off Amy because of that choice. \n\nIn that case, the author's decision is based on their personal beliefs and their relationship with Amy. They aren't in the wrong for choosing to cut off Amy, but their reasoning might be flawed. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) aspect is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since Amy is doing her job, the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy over this. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
