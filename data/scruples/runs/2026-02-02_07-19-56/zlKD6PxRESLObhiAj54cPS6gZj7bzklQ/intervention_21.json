We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation involves their older sister Jane being charged with fraud, and Amy, the younger sister, representing Jane pro bono. The author feels that Jane is guilty, and Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt, which upsets the author. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Amy is an attorney, so she has professional obligations. One of the main points is that as a defense attorney, Amy's role is to defend Jane, not to prove her guilt. The author might not understand that an attorney's job is to protect their client's rights and ensure a fair trial, regardless of the client's guilt. That could be a misunderstanding on the author's part.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author and Amy are close, but the author is cutting off Amy because of her professional choices. The author might believe that Amy should act a certain way ethically, but Amy is focusing on her career and proving herself in a competitive field. The author is upset because Amy is representing someone the author sees as guilty, and maybe the author feels betrayed because Amy isn't taking their side.\n\nThe author's justification for cutting off Amy is based on Amy's professional decisions. But is it fair for the author to expect Amy to compromise her career or professional ethics? Attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, even if they personally believe their client is guilty. So Amy is doing her job, which might be something the author isn't considering.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about family values and doing the right thing. They might feel that Amy is helping a guilty person avoid punishment, which the author sees as morally wrong. However, the legal system is supposed to protect the innocent and ensure that the prosecution has to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Amy's role is part of that system.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for cutting off Amy? If the author is using personal ethics to demand that Amy act against her professional duties, then maybe the author is overstepping. Amy is doing her job, and the author might not be respecting her professional choices. The author's reaction could be seen as imposing their moral standards on Amy's career, which is a separate aspect of her life.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified if they feel Amy is being unethical. But as a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to act as a moral arbiter. So the author's expectation might be unrealistic. The author could be in the wrong because they are cutting off a family member over professional conduct that is within the attorney's duty.\n\nI think the key points are the role of a defense attorney versus personal morality. The author might not fully grasp that Amy's job isn't to prove guilt but to ensure a fair trial. Therefore, the author's decision to cut off Amy could be based on a misunderstanding of Amy's professional obligations. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but wait, maybe it's the opposite. Wait, I need to check if the author is in the wrong. If the author is wrong for not respecting Amy's professional role, then the answer would be A. But if the author is right in their moral stance, then B. Hmm.\n\nBut in reality, as a defense attorney, Amy is supposed to defend Jane regardless of her guilt. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, but that's not Amy's role. The author is cutting off Amy because Amy is doing her job, which might be the author's mistake. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for holding Amy to a different standard than her professional duties require. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Wait, but the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Maybe I need to consider both perspectives again.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Amy should act morally by trying to get Jane to confess or seek justice. But Amy is a defense attorney, so her job isn't to seek justice but to defend Jane. The author's expectation is conflicting with Amy's professional role. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding that Amy's job is to defend Jane, not to act as a prosecutor. Cutting off a sister over that could be seen as the author's mistake. So the answer is A.\n"
