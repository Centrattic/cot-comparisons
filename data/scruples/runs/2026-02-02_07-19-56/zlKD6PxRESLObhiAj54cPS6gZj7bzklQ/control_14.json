We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and their other sister Amy, a defense attorney, is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and instead is focused on winning the case, regardless of Jane's guilt. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't do what they think is right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to prove guilt. The principle of \"innocent until proven guilty\" is a cornerstone of the legal system. Even if everyone thinks Jane is guilty, Amy's role is to ensure the prosecution has to meet the burden of proof. So Amy's approach is actually in line with her professional duties. The author might not understand this, thinking that Amy should be trying to make Jane confess or get her convicted, but that's not the attorney's role.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author and Amy are siblings, and their relationship is now strained. The author feels betrayed because Amy isn't acting in the way they believe is right. However, Amy might feel that the author is interfering in her professional responsibilities and maybe even undermining her career. The author's threat to cut contact is a strong reaction. While the author is frustrated, cutting off a sister over a legal strategy might be seen as extreme, especially if they don't fully grasp the legal implications.\n\nAnother angle is the author's personal feelings towards Jane. The author has a troubled relationship with Jane and sees her as morally bankrupt. But Amy is providing a service that's necessary for Jane's legal process. The author might be projecting their feelings onto Amy, expecting her to share their moral judgment, which isn't necessarily her role. \n\nAmy's motivation is also in question. She mentions wanting to represent people like Jane to build her career, which the author finds concerning. But as a professional, it's her right to choose her clients. The legal system allows defense attorneys to represent anyone, even those they believe are guilty. The author's criticism of Amy's approach might stem from not understanding the legal ethics or the importance of a robust defense.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is not in the wrong in feeling hurt or disappointed, but their response of cutting off Amy could be seen as overreacting. Amy isn't violating any ethical standards by defending Jane; she's just doing her job. The author's threat might be a result of not understanding the legal process, but that doesn't make the author right in cutting contact. However, the author isn't necessarily at fault for their feelings or actions, given the family context and their personal moral stance. But legally, Amy is correct in her approach.\n\nSo, the author's actions are based on personal morals conflicting with professional ethics. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. If the author is right in thinking Amy should be doing something else, but Amy is following legal norms, then the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings but might be in the wrong for cutting off a family member over this. Alternatively, if the author's actions are a legitimate response to their sister's unethical behavior, then they might be justified. It's a bit of a toss-up, but considering legal ethics and family dynamics, the author might not be in the wrong for their feelings but could be in the wrong for cutting off Amy, given that Amy is acting within her professional role.\n"
