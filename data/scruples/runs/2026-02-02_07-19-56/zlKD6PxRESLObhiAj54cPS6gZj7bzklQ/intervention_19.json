We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that their sister Jane was arrested for fraud, and the author's other sister, Amy, is representing her pro-bono. The author is upset because Amy is trying to get Jane off even though everyone thinks she's guilty. They ended up cutting off Amy because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. As an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of personal feelings or the client's guilt. The legal system is supposed to ensure that everyone gets a fair trial, and defense attorneys are ethically obligated to do that. So Amy is probably doing her job by not trying to prove Jane guilty. The author might not understand or agree with that, but it's part of the legal process.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author feels that Jane is guilty and deserves consequences. They're disappointed that Amy isn't taking that stance. The author's decision to cut off Amy is a personal choice, but is it wrong? It depends on perspective. The author might feel justified because of their moral stance, but cutting off a sibling is a big step. However, if they believe Amy is complicit in Jane's wrongdoing, they might feel it's necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy might be doing her job, and the author is overstepping by pressuring her to act against her professional ethics. The author's threat to cut contact could be seen as holding a personal grudge against Amy for doing her job. That could be the wrong approach because Amy has a duty to her client and her profession.\n\nAlso, the author might be projecting their feelings toward Jane onto Amy. If the author has a strained relationship with Jane, they might be transferring that conflict to Amy, who is just doing her job. The author's reaction might be more about their own feelings towards Jane than about Amy's actions.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong by cutting off Amy for doing her professional duty. The legal system relies on defense attorneys to provide zealous representation, even if the client is guilty. The author's decision to cut contact could be seen as punishing Amy for upholding her professional responsibilities, which isn't fair. But if the author feels betrayed because Amy isn't taking their moral stance, it's a personal conflict. However, the ethical obligation of an attorney is to represent the client, not to act as a moral judge. So the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
