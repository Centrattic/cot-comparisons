We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because she's defending her guilty sister Jane. \n\nFirst, the author's sister Jane is guilty of fraud. The author feels Jane has no morals and is a bad person. Amy, the other sister, is an attorney and is defending Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty but instead wants to win at all costs, even if Jane is guilty. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing.\"\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. As an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane. Even if Jane is guilty, Amy must provide a vigorous defense. The attorney-client privilege and ethical obligations require that. So Amy is doing her job. The author is upset that Amy isn't acting as a moral arbiter but as a professional. \n\nThe author's main issue is that Amy isn't helping to punish Jane for her crimes. But Amy's role isn't to punish; it's to ensure the legal process is fair. The author's moral stance might not align with Amy's professional duties. \n\nHowever, cutting off family ties because of professional ethics is extreme. The author is using personal feelings against their sister's career. But maybe the author isn't wrong in feeling hurt and disappointed. However, is cutting off contact justified? Amy is doing her job, so the author might be wrong to cut her off. \n\nBut Amy's actions are within her professional duties. The author's anger stems from personal relationships and moral judgments. The author might be wrong to expect Amy to act against her professional ethics for family reasons. So perhaps the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their values, but others might argue that the author is overreacting. Wait, but legally and ethically, Amy must defend Jane. So the author is in the right to be upset but cutting off family is a personal choice. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified. Since Amy is acting professionally, the author is not in the wrong for cutting her off because they can't control professional ethics in a family member. But maybe the author is wrong to cut off contact because they can't impose their moral views on Amy's career. Hmm. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
