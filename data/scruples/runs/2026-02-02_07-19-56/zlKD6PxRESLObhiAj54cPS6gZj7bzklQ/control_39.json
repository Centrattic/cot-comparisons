We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, the situation: Amy is a defense attorney representing their sister Jane, who is guilty of fraud. The author believes Jane is guilty and wants her to face consequences. Amy, however, is trying to secure a better outcome for Jane, maybe even get her off, despite knowing she's guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't being ethical and threatens to cut her off if she doesn't do the \"right thing.\"\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. As a defense attorney, Amy's role is to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. That's the system's design\u2014to ensure fair trials and protect the rights of the accused. Even if the client is guilty, the lawyer must zealously represent them. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt but is instead trying to win the case, which is actually her job.\n\nThe author's frustration stems from personal morals. They see Amy as unethical for defending a guilty sister, but in legal terms, Amy is doing her job correctly. The author's threat to cut off contact is based on personal disagreement with Amy's professional decisions. However, Amy has the right to choose her clients and how she represents them, even if it's distasteful to family members.\n\nThere's also the element of family conflict. The author might feel betrayed because Amy is prioritizing her career and Jane's interests over the family's moral stance. But Amy might be facing her own pressures, like gender bias in the legal field, as mentioned. She's using this case to prove herself, which adds another layer to her motivation.\n\nIs the author wrong? They're not in the wrong for feeling hurt or for wanting justice, but cutting someone off over professional ethics is complex. The author's actions are a personal choice based on their values, but they aren't necessarily unethical or wrong. The system allows for defense attorneys to represent anyone, so Amy isn't violating any rules. The author's reaction is understandable given the family dynamics, but not everyone might agree with their decision to cut off contact. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Amy is acting within her professional role, the author's stance is based on personal ethics, not legal wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
