We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister, Jane, is a fraud and has a history of bad behavior. The other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who takes on Jane's case pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt, even though they all believe she is guilty. The author thinks Amy should get Jane to confess or at least get some punishment, but Amy is focused on winning the case, possibly even defending someone controversial to gain recognition.\n\nThe author confronts Amy, tells her they'll cut contact if she doesn't do the \"right thing,\" and Amy gets angry, leading to a breakup. The author is now asking if they're the one at fault.\n\nNow, the ethical question here is complex. On one hand, the author is frustrated because Amy is defending someone they all think is guilty, which feels like she's helping a criminal. On the other hand, Amy is a defense attorney, and her job is to defend her client, regardless of their guilt. It's the role of the defense to ensure that the prosecution meets the burden of proof. Even if the client is guilty, a good defense attorney will still do their best to protect their rights and ensure that the system works fairly.\n\nThe author is pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties, which is a conflict. As an attorney, Amy is ethically bound to represent Jane to the best of her ability, not to secure a conviction. The author's ultimatum to cut her off for doing her job might be crossing a line. However, Amy's statement about wanting to represent controversial cases like the next O.J. and not caring about her reputation could be seen as problematic from a family perspective, even if professionally justified.\n\nBut legally and ethically, Amy is correct in her approach. Defense attorneys don't have a duty to secure a conviction; they have a duty to their client and the legal system. The author's reaction is based on personal feelings and the belief that Jane is guilty, but they can't control Amy's professional conduct.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy. If Amy is doing her job as an attorney, even if it's against the family's wishes, the author's decision to cut her off might be seen as holding a personal grudge against her for fulfilling her professional obligations. However, the author has the right to distance themselves from Amy if they disagree with her actions, even if those actions are legally sound. But is cutting off contact because of professional decisions ethical? It might not be, especially if Amy is just doing her job. The author is mixing personal feelings with professional ethics here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because they are punishing Amy for performing her professional duties. However, if the author values moral alignment in family, their decision could be seen as a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. But given that Amy is acting within her professional role, the author might be in the wrong for cutting her off over this.\n"
