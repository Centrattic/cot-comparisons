We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The author's sister Jane is arrested for fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is a defense attorney who takes Jane's case pro-bono. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is focusing on winning the case, even if Jane is guilty. The author confronts Amy, who explains her professional motivations, and the author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't act \"right.\" They end up in a heated argument.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is about professional responsibility vs. family loyalty. Amy, as an attorney, is bound by her professional duty to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of guilt. This is a cornerstone of the legal system\u2014every defendant deserves a fair trial. So Amy's actions are within her professional obligations. The author, on the other hand, values moral judgment and believes Amy should represent the sister's guilt, but that's not her role as an attorney.\n\nThe author's main issue is that Amy is not doing what he perceives as the \"right\" thing, which is to ensure Jane is convicted. However, Amy is acting in her professional capacity, which requires her to zealously represent Jane's interests, even if she believes Jane is guilty. The author is conflating personal morality with professional ethics. \n\nThe author is threatening to cut off Amy because of her professional decisions, which might be seen as holding personal expectations against her job role. Amy's response about wanting to prove herself in a male-dominated field adds another layer, suggesting professional ambition is a factor. But even so, her duty to her client is paramount.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is upset about family values and justice, but Amy is just doing her job. The author's threat to cut contact is extreme, but does he have a right to be upset? Maybe, but Amy isn't violating any ethics. The author's actions stem from personal moral judgments rather than recognizing her professional responsibilities. So, the author might not be in the wrong because he's acting based on his values, but Amy is also within her rights. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since Amy is acting ethically and the author is punishing her for fulfilling her duties, maybe the author is overstepping. But the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified given the context.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the person acted unreasonably. Here, the author's sister is doing her job, which the author doesn't understand. So the author is wrong for cutting her off because he's holding her to a personal moral standard instead of respecting her professional role. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
