We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because she's defending their other sister, Jane, who's clearly guilty. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is close to Amy, their younger sister, who's a defense attorney. Jane, the older sister, was arrested for fraud, and Amy is representing her pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt, even though Amy believes Jane is guilty. The author thinks Amy should make Jane face consequences, but Amy is focused on winning the case and building her career. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing,\" leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, Amy is doing her job as an attorney. Defense lawyers have an ethical obligation to represent their clients to the best of their ability, regardless of their personal beliefs about the client's guilt. So, Amy is fulfilling her professional duty by defending Jane, even if she's guilty. The author is upset because they want Jane to be punished, but that's not how the justice system works. The author is essentially asking Amy to act as a prosecutor instead of a defense attorney, which is a conflict of roles.\n\nOn the personal side, the author is cutting off a family member over this. The author's actions are based on their moral judgment and the belief that Amy is wrong for not seeking justice. However, Amy might feel that her professional ethics and career are at stake. The author is pressuring Amy to act against her professional responsibilities, which could be seen as wrong. The author is also cutting off contact, which is a serious step, but whether it's justified depends on the context. \n\nThe author might argue that Amy is betraying family values by defending a guilty relative, but Amy is following her professional code. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal choice, but it's based on their moral stance. However, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether they have the right to dictate how Amy does her job, especially since Amy is acting within her professional ethics. \n\nSo, considering legal ethics and personal relationships, the author might be in the right in their own mind, but from an external perspective, Amy is just doing her job. The author's actions might be seen as overstepping, as they can't control Amy's professional decisions. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is wrong for cutting off their sister over this. But the question is about the author being in the wrong. If Amy is acting ethically, then the author's reaction is based on a misunderstanding of her role. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to cut contact because Amy is doing her job, but maybe the author is wrong for pressuring her. Hmm. \n\nWait, the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context usually looks at whether the actions were reasonable. The author is upset that Amy is defending a guilty person. But as a defense attorney, that's her job. The author is cutting off a family member over this. Is the author in the wrong? Maybe not, because they feel strongly about justice. But Amy is within her rights to defend her sister. The author's actions are a personal choice, but the question is if they are wrong. \n\nIn this case, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the author is acting on their own moral beliefs and the decision to cut contact is a personal one, not necessarily unethical. However, some might argue that the author is wrong for pressuring a family member's professional decisions. But in the context of AITA, the author's action is a personal choice, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
