We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author has a sister named Jane who was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their younger sister Amy, a defense attorney, who is representing Jane pro-bono. The author feels that Jane is guilty and lacks morality. They had a discussion where Amy confirmed Jane's guilt but said she wouldn't prove it in court because of lack of evidence. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to make Jane confess or get her a harsher sentence. Amy is focused on winning, even if it means unethical tactics, and the author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing.\" They had a big argument, and the author is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off Amy because of her professional decisions. First, I need to consider the ethics of a lawyer's role. Defense attorneys are supposed to defend their clients, regardless of the client's guilt. Their job isn't to \"get them convicted\" but to ensure a fair trial. If there's insufficient evidence, the lawyer can't ethically push for a guilty verdict. Amy's approach might be within professional boundaries, even if the author disagrees.\n\nThe author is upset that Amy isn't trying to make Jane confess or get a harsher sentence. But a defense attorney's job isn't to punish the client. Their duty is to their client, not to the author or society. So maybe Amy is doing her job correctly. The author's expectation that Amy should act as a prosecutor might be unrealistic. \n\nOn the other hand, Amy's comments about wanting to represent the next O.J. and her competitive nature might be concerning. But as a professional, she's within her rights to defend her clients aggressively. The author's threat to cut off contact might be a personal decision, but is it wrong? The author is justified in feeling hurt if they think Amy is enabling Jane's behavior, but they also have a right to set boundaries in their relationship. \n\nIs the author wrong for cutting off Amy? Well, they have the right to decide their own relationships. However, forcing Amy to act against her professional ethics might not be fair. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty and want her punished, but Amy is doing her job. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off contact due to personal disagreements, but perhaps they misunderstood Amy's role. \n\nAlso, the author is close to Amy, and this situation is causing family strain. But the author's actions are based on their moral standpoint, even if Amy is following legal ethics. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for that. I think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own moral stance and setting boundaries, even if Amy is doing her job as a lawyer. However, it's a complicated situation where both sides have valid points. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling the way they do and taking action based on their values.\n"
