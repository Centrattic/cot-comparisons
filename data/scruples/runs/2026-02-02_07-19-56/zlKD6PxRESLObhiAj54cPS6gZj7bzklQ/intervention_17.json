We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because of her decision to defend their sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is close to Amy, who's a defense attorney. Jane, their older sister, is guilty and has a history of moral issues. Amy is representing Jane pro bono, even though she believes Jane is guilty. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to convict Jane and instead wants to win the case for her career. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right\" thing, which leads to a fallout.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here. The author is frustrated that Amy isn't acting in what they see as the morally correct way. But as a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, regardless of guilt. It's part of the legal system's structure to ensure fair trials. Even if Jane is guilty, the attorney must provide the best defense possible. The author is imposing their moral judgment on a professional duty.\n\nThe author's decision to cut off contact is a personal choice, but is that wrong? The question is whether they overstepped. Amy is doing her job, even if the author disapproves. The author's threat to cut ties is based on Amy fulfilling her professional role, which might be a personal conflict but not inherently unethical. However, cutting someone off over a moral disagreement can be seen as harsh, but it's also a personal boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's approach might be seen as ethically questionable if she's manipulating her role for personal gain or not upholding justice. But from a legal standpoint, she's within her rights. The author's frustration is valid, but using that as a reason to cut off family ties raises questions about the appropriateness of their reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. The author is not wrong for having strong feelings about the situation, but cutting off a loved one over a professional role might be an overreaction. However, if the author feels this is necessary for their own ethical stance, they might not be in the wrong. The line here is blurry, but the key point is that Amy's job is separate from the author's moral views. The author's actions are a personal choice, but they could be seen as wrong if they're enforcing their moral standards on someone else's professional obligations.\n"
