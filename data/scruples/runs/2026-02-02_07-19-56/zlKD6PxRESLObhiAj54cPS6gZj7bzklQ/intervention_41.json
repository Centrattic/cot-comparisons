We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, the situation involves the author's sister Jane being arrested for fraud. The author is close to their younger sister Amy, who is a defense attorney and decided to represent Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is defending her, which the author sees as unethical. They confront Amy, and the relationship breaks down, leading the author to consider cutting contact.\n\nSo, the key points here are the ethical duties of a defense attorney versus the author's personal feelings. Defense attorneys have a professional obligation to defend their clients zealously, regardless of the client's guilt. Their job isn't to determine guilt but to ensure their client receives a fair trial. This is a fundamental principle in the legal system to protect individual rights.\n\nThe author feels that Amy is being unethical because she's not trying to prove Jane guilty. But legally and ethically, Amy is doing her job correctly. The author's anger stems from personal feelings towards Jane and their disagreement with Amy's professional approach. However, Amy's role is to represent Jane to the best of her ability, which includes challenging the prosecution's case, not necessarily trying to get Jane convicted.\n\nThe author's threat to cut off Amy is based on a misunderstanding of legal ethics. By doing so, the author is prioritizing their personal judgment over Amy's professional responsibilities. Amy's actions, while perhaps difficult for the family to accept, are within the bounds of her professional duties. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy because they're holding her to a standard that contradicts her legal obligations.\n\nAdditionally, the author's decision to sever ties might be an overreaction. While the situation is emotionally charged, the legal system requires defense attorneys to provide robust representation. The author's reaction doesn't take into account the professional code Amy must follow. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
