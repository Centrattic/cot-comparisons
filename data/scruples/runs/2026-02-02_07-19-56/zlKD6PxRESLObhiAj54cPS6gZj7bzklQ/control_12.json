We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. The situation involves their sister Jane, who's been arrested for fraud. The author's other sister, Amy, is an attorney representing Jane pro bono, even though everyone knows Jane is guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author feels that Amy is being unethical by defending Jane without trying to prove her guilt, even though Amy herself believes Jane is guilty. The author is upset that Amy is prioritizing winning over justice, and this leads to cutting contact. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the author's decision to cut off Amy is based on moral disagreements about her professional conduct. However, Amy is within her rights as an attorney to defend Jane to the best of her ability, even if she believes her client is guilty. The attorney's role is to provide the best defense possible, not to prove guilt. The author might feel betrayed, but Amy is doing her job. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable, but cutting off a sister over this might be an extreme reaction. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are a personal choice based on their values, while Amy's are professional. Since the author isn't violating any laws or ethical standards by cutting contact, but rather making a personal decision based on their beliefs, the answer might be that they're not in the wrong. \n\nBut I should check if there's any ethical obligation for Amy. In legal ethics, attorneys must zealously represent clients without compromising their integrity. Amy isn't doing anything unethical here. The author's issue is with Amy's approach, but that's a personal conflict, not a legal wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction, even if cutting contact is harsh. So the answer is B.\n"
