We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane committed fraud and is being defended by Amy, their other sister. The author believes Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt but instead is focused on winning the case, maybe even helping Jane avoid consequences. The author is cutting off Amy because of this, thinking it's the right thing to do. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nAmy is an attorney, and her job is to defend her client, regardless of the client's guilt. That's part of the legal system. So, from a professional standpoint, Amy is doing her job. The author expects Amy to act unprofessionally by trying to get Jane to confess or secure a guilty plea, but that's not how defense attorneys operate. Their role is to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. If there's insufficient evidence, it's their duty to challenge it, not to secure a guilty verdict.\n\nThe author is cutting off Amy because they disagree with her professional ethics. But Amy isn't breaking any rules by doing her job. The author's moral stance might be personal, but that doesn't mean Amy is wrong. The author is punishing Amy for doing her job, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nHowever, the author might feel that Amy is enabling Jane's behavior, but as a defense attorney, Amy's role isn't to punish Jane but to uphold legal standards. The author's decision to cut off Amy might be about their personal relationship and values, but it's not necessarily the author being in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the author is taking a stance based on their moral beliefs. If Amy is violating her professional ethics, maybe the author is justified. However, defense attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, even if they believe the client is guilty. That's part of the adversarial system. So Amy isn't doing anything unethical. The author is upset because they want justice, but Amy is doing her job. \n\nSo, the author is cutting off Amy for doing her job, which is not her fault. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. But maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to be upset and choose their relationships. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether cutting off a family member for doing their job is justified. The author's actions are a personal choice, but Amy isn't doing anything wrong. So the author isn't in the wrong for their feelings, but maybe they are wrong in cutting off Amy for professional reasons. \n\nHmm. It's tricky. The author might not be in the wrong for their feelings, but the question is about whether their action (cutting off Amy) is wrong. Since Amy is acting within her professional duties, the author is wrong to punish her for that. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they are cutting off Amy for doing her job properly. But others might argue that it's personal and the author isn't wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has the right to their moral stance. But I think legally, Amy is doing her job, so the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy for that. So the answer is A.\n"
