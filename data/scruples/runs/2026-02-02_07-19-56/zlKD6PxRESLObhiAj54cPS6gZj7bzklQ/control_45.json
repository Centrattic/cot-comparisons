We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author cutting off contact with their sister, Jane, because she's an attorney who's defending their other sister, who's guilty of fraud. The author is upset because Amy, the defending sister, is trying to get her sister off despite knowing she's guilty. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. As an attorney, Amy's job is to provide the best defense for her client, regardless of the client's guilt. That's part of the legal system\u2014guilty or not, everyone deserves a fair trial. The author might not agree with Amy's approach, but is it Amy's fault for doing her job? The author is cutting off Amy for not doing what they think is right, but maybe they don't understand the legal ethics here.\n\nThen there's the family relationship. The author feels betrayed because Amy is defending Jane, who's guilty. But Amy has her own reasons, like wanting to prove herself in a male-dominated field. The author is threatening to cut contact, which is a big deal. Is the author overreacting? Maybe. They might be projecting their feelings towards Jane onto Amy. Amy is doing her job, but the author sees it as being unethical.\n\nAlso, the author's own judgment about Jane's guilt might not be relevant. Even if they know Jane is guilty, the legal process requires a defense. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove guilt, but that's not Amy's role. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting Amy's professional role and for threatening to cut contact over something that's part of her job.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author has a point if Amy is being unethical. However, as a defense attorney, Amy's job isn't to prove guilt but to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. The author might not realize that. So the author's misunderstanding of legal roles could be why they're upset. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because Amy is acting within her professional duties, and the author is justified in feeling hurt, but cutting contact might be extreme. But maybe not in the wrong because Amy is doing her job correctly.\n"
