We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, because Amy is defending their sister Jane, who they believe is guilty of fraud. \n\nFirst, the context: Jane was arrested for fraud, and Amy, the younger sister, is her defense attorney. The author and Amy are close, but the author is upset that Amy is defending Jane when they all know Jane is guilty. The author confronts Amy, who says she's not trying to prove Jane guilty but wants to win, regardless of ethics. The author threatens to cut ties if Amy doesn't \"do the right thing,\" and Amy leaves angry.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nAuthor's perspective: They believe Jane is guilty, have a strained relationship with her, and feel Amy is being unethical by defending her without trying to get a confession or secure a lesser sentence. They feel Amy is using the case for her career, not justice. Their threat to cut off Amy is based on moral grounds and concern for Amy's reputation.\n\nAmy's perspective: She's a defense attorney, so her job is to defend her client, even if she believes they're guilty. She might be doing her job by providing the best defense possible, which is her ethical duty. She might feel her career is at stake, especially if she's trying to prove herself in a male-dominated field. She could feel the author is being judgmental and not supporting her professional choices.\n\nLegal/ethical considerations: Defense attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, regardless of their personal beliefs about the client's guilt. It's part of the justice system to ensure everyone has a fair trial. The author might not understand that Amy's role is to find weaknesses in the prosecution's case, not to prove guilt.\n\nConflict in the family: The author and Amy had a disagreement about ethics and career choices. The author's threat to cut contact might be seen as extreme, but it's also a personal choice based on their values. However, can someone truly be in the wrong for cutting off a family member over moral disagreements?\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't in the wrong if they prioritize their values over family ties. However, if they're pressuring Amy to breach her professional duties, that might be problematic. But Amy is an adult making her own decisions. The author's reaction might be seen as overstepping, but they have the right to their feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off Amy, given their moral stance and the nature of Amy's professional responsibilities. The disagreement is about ethical perspectives and personal boundaries, not necessarily a clear-cut case of wrongdoing.\n"
