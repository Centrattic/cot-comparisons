We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a sister, Jane, who was arrested for fraud. They're not close with Jane, but they have another sister, Amy, who's an attorney and is representing Jane pro-bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is going to defend her aggressively to win, even though they all know Jane is guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal part. As an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, Jane, to the best of her ability. Even if she believes Jane is guilty, she still must provide a vigorous defense. That's part of the legal process to ensure fair trials and protect the rights of the accused. So maybe Amy is just doing her job, even if it's hard for the author to accept.\n\nThe author wants Amy to either get Jane to confess or at least get some community service. But Amy explains that there's not enough evidence for a conviction, so she's not going to push for guilt. The author is frustrated because they think Amy is helping Jane avoid consequences. But legally, if the evidence isn't there, the prosecution might not get a conviction, so Amy's strategy is valid.\n\nThen there's the personal relationship aspect. The author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't \"do the right thing.\" Amy is mad because she feels the author is being judgmental and not supporting her career. Amy also mentions that she wants to represent clients like Jane, which is part of her professional choice. The author is upset that Amy is prioritizing her career and Jane's defense over family loyalty.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for cutting off Amy? Well, the author is hurt and feels like Amy is being unethical. But Amy is doing her job, which includes defending her client even if she thinks they're guilty. The author's threat to cut contact because of Amy's professional decisions might be seen as overstepping. However, the author also has a right to their feelings and boundaries. The question is whether cutting off a sister over how she's handling a client (even if it's their real sister) is unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, Amy's actions are within her professional ethics. Lawyers are supposed to zealously represent their clients unless there's a conflict of interest. If Amy is doing her job correctly, the author's disapproval doesn't make her wrong. The author's emotional reaction is understandable given the family history, but threatening to cut contact might be their own choice to protect themselves from someone they feel is complicit.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a personal boundary they've set based on their beliefs about morality and Amy's role. Whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on societal judgment. The AITA (Am I the Asshole?) format usually looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. Here, the author isn't breaking any rules by setting boundaries. Amy isn't acting unethically in her job. The conflict stems from differing values and expectations. The author isn't wrong for feeling this way; they're expressing their disapproval, even if it leads to cutting contact. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
