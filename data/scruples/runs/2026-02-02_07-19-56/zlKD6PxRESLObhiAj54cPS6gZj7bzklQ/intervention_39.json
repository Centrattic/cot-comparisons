We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their younger sister Amy, who is a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane pro-bono. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty of the fraud and other morally wrong actions, like stealing and lying. They had a conversation where Amy admitted Jane is guilty but decided not to pursue a guilty verdict because there's not enough evidence. The author is frustrated Amy isn't trying to get Jane to confess or face consequences, and now Amy is acting more like a \"shark\" wanting to win at all costs. The author threatened to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing, leading to a fight.\n\nSo, the author is accusing Amy of not doing the right thing by defending a guilty person, while Amy is defending her professional ethics and career ambitions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical roles here. As a defense attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client, not to determine guilt. Even if Jane is guilty, Amy's duty is to provide the best possible defense. The author is upset Amy isn't trying to get Jane convicted, but that's not her role. The author might be conflating personal feelings with legal ethics here.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that Amy is compromising their family's values and could face backlash for representing someone they all consider guilty. But is it the author's place to dictate Amy's professional decisions? Amy is an adult and has the right to choose her cases and how she approaches them, even if it's morally conflicting for the family.\n\nThe author's threat to cut contact over professional ethics is a big decision. Family relationships are personal, but the author is imposing their moral standards on Amy's career. The author might be in the wrong because they're using their relationship to pressure Amy into acting against her professional duties. However, if Amy is using the case for career advancement, maybe the author has valid concerns about hypocrisy or unethical behavior.\n\nBut according to legal ethics, a defense attorney must zealously represent their client, regardless of guilt. So Amy is doing her job. The author's problem is with Amy's choices, not her adherence to her role. Therefore, the author might be overstepping by cutting off Amy for doing her job, even if it conflicts with their personal values.\n\nHowever, the author could argue that Amy is enabling Jane's actions by not seeking justice. But in the legal system, the role of defense is to ensure the prosecution has to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. If there's insufficient evidence, the system is designed to let the guilty go free, which is a principle in justice. So Amy is following the system's rules.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is upset with Amy's professional choices, but Amy is fulfilling her duties as an attorney. The author's decision to cut contact is based on personal moral disagreements with Amy's career decisions, which may not be the author's place to enforce. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off Amy over this.\n"
