We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The younger sister Amy, a defense attorney, is representing Jane pro bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and feels Amy isn't doing her job to prove guilt. Amy, however, is focused on winning the case regardless of Jane's guilt, which upsets the author. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't act \"rightly,\" leading to a fallout.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. To determine this, I should consider the ethical and practical aspects. \n\nAmy's role as a defense attorney is to represent her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. This is a core principle of the legal system\u2014everyone is entitled to a defense, even if they are guilty. By cutting off Amy, the author is punishing her for doing her job ethically. The author might feel betrayed because they believe Amy isn't being truthful about Jane's guilt, but Amy's obligation is to her client, Jane, not the author.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's frustration is understandable. They see Jane's actions as morally wrong and are concerned that Amy is enabling her. However, Amy's decision to represent Jane is her professional choice, and the author's threat to cut contact could be seen as overstepping. The author's actions are based on their personal morals versus Amy's professional ethics.\n\nIn legal terms, defense attorneys are supposed to zealously represent their clients, even if the client is guilty. The author's reaction might be seen as an attempt to interfere with Amy's professional duties, which isn't appropriate. However, family dynamics add complexity. The author is entitled to their feelings, but cutting off a sibling over professional decisions is a personal choice, not necessarily a moral wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for having these feelings, but they might be wrong in cutting off Amy for doing her job. The answer leans towards B (No), but there's nuance. The key point is that Amy is fulfilling her professional role, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their response might be extreme. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions are based on personal ethics versus professional ethics, it's a matter of differing perspectives. The answer might be B.\n"
