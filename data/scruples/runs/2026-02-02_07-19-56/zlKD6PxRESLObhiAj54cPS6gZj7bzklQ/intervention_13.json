We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because she's defending their guilty older sister. \n\nFirst, the sister Amy is a criminal defense attorney and chose to represent their sister Jane, who's been arrested for fraud. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty, even though everyone knows she did it. The author wants Amy to help the prosecution, but Amy is focused on winning the case.\n\nSo, the author threatens to cut off Amy if she doesn't do the right thing. Amy is upset and leaves. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nHmm. Legally, as an attorney, Amy has a duty to her client, Jane. Even if she suspects Jane is guilty, she can't help the prosecution. Her job is to provide a robust defense. The author is asking Amy to breach her professional ethics, which she can't do. The author is frustrated because they think Amy's approach is unethical, but maybe they don't understand the attorney-client privilege and the duty to defend regardless of personal feelings.\n\nThe author's main issue is that they want justice (Jane to be punished) and are disappointed that Amy isn't helping. However, Amy's role is to ensure Jane's rights are protected, not to punish her. The author might be conflating their personal feelings with legal obligations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're cutting off a family member for doing her job. Amy is following professional ethics, so the author's threat to cut her off is misplaced. The author isn't wrong in feeling upset, but they are wrong in pressuring Amy to act unprofessionally. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
