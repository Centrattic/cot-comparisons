We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their other sister Amy, who is a defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane pro bono, and Jane is guilty of the fraud, though she hasn't confessed. Amy's job as a defense attorney is to represent her client, which includes trying to get the best possible outcome, even if the client is guilty. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty but is instead trying to win the case, which the author sees as unethical.\n\nThe author then threatens to cut contact with Amy if she doesn't do the right thing. Amy gets defensive, saying she's fighting for her career and wants to prove herself in a male-dominated field. The author's main issue is that they believe Amy should be doing her job in a way that aligns with their moral judgment, which might not be fair. \n\nNow, considering the ethical obligations of an attorney: defense lawyers are supposed to zealously represent their clients, regardless of the clients' guilt. It's part of the legal system's adversarial process. So Amy is doing her job as expected. The author is interfering with that role, possibly pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong here because they're expecting Amy to take sides in a legal matter where her professional responsibility is to her client, not their family's moral stance. Cutting off a sister over this could be seen as overstepping, especially if Amy is within her rights to defend Jane. However, the author has the right to be upset and to set boundaries in their relationship. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author is pressuring a family member to breach their professional ethics, that's problematic. On the other hand, if Amy is doing her job correctly, then the author's anger might be misplaced. The author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to express their disapproval and make personal decisions about their relationships. However, the key point is that Amy is acting professionally, and the author is interfering. \n\nSo, in legal terms, defense attorneys have an ethical duty to represent their clients. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for pressuring Amy to not fulfill her professional responsibilities. The answer might be A. But wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, maybe because they think Amy should act morally. But legally, Amy must do her job. The author is wrong for cutting off Amy over this. So the answer is A.\n"
