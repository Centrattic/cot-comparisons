We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Jane, because of her decisions as an attorney. The sister, Amy, is representing their guilty sibling pro bono, and the author is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty but instead wants to win at all costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. As an attorney, Amy's duty is to her client, Jane, and she must provide a vigorous defense regardless of guilt. It's part of the legal system to ensure fair trials. The author might think Amy should act on their moral judgment, but legally, that's not how it works. Attorneys can't be biased against their clients; they have to defend them zealously.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author and Amy are close, but the author is upset because they believe Amy's actions are wrong. They even threatened to cut contact if Amy doesn't \"do the right thing.\" Cutting off a family member is a big step. The author is prioritizing their moral stance over the relationship, which can be seen as harsh, especially if Amy is just doing her job.\n\nAmy's perspective is also important. She's in a male-dominated field and wants to prove herself, so taking a high-profile case like Jane's could be her way of gaining recognition. She might feel that her career is at stake, and she's under pressure to win, not necessarily to find the truth. The author might not understand that her actions are professional, not personal.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's reasoning is that Amy is not doing the right thing by defending Jane, but legally, Amy is correct in her role. The author's threat to cut contact seems extreme. While Amy's actions might be ethically questionable from a family standpoint, as an attorney, she's within her rights. The author might be projecting their own feelings about Jane onto Amy's professional duties.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is probably not in the wrong for being upset, but threatening to cut off a sister over professional ethics might be taking it too far. However, the core of the issue is the author's expectation that Amy should act against her professional duties, which isn't reasonable. Therefore, Amy is in the right to defend her client, and the author is in the wrong for pressuring her and threatening to cut contact.\n"
