We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nSo, the author has an older sister, Jane, who's been arrested for fraud. They're close to their younger sister, Amy, a criminal defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro bono, even though everyone, including Amy, knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane guilty and instead is planning to win the case despite Jane's guilt. The author then threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing,\" leading to a fallout.\n\nThe author's main issue is that Amy is defending Jane without trying to secure a guilty verdict, even though Jane is clearly guilty. The author thinks Amy should be doing the \"right thing,\" which in their view is ensuring Jane faces consequences. Amy, on the other hand, is focused on her career, her professional ethics, and perhaps her own motivations, like proving herself in a male-dominated field.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. As an attorney, Amy's job is to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of the client's guilt. That's a fundamental part of the legal system. The idea is that everyone deserves a fair trial, and the attorney's duty is to ensure that process works, not to determine the client's guilt. So from a professional standpoint, Amy is doing her job correctly. The author might not agree with her approach emotionally, but legally, Amy is within her rights.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The author feels that cutting off Amy is justified because she's not doing what the author considers \"right.\" But Amy might feel that her professional ethics and career are at stake here. The author is imposing their moral expectations on Amy's professional duties, which might be a conflict they didn't anticipate. The author's threat to cut contact is a significant action based on differing values.\n\nAnother angle: the author's relationship with Jane is already strained. The author's resentment towards Jane's behavior and Amy's defense of her could be contributing to the author's anger. However, Amy's actions are within her professional role. The author might be projecting their own feelings about Jane onto Amy, expecting her to act in a certain way that aligns with the author's moral compass rather than her professional obligations.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy. The author believes they're doing the right thing by enforcing their moral standards, while Amy is doing her job. From a legal and professional ethics perspective, Amy isn't wrong. However, the author's decision to cut contact is a personal choice based on their values. The problem is whether the author is wrong to hold such a stance.\n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit context, the community often looks at whether the person's actions are unreasonable given the circumstances. The author's actions are extreme, but they stem from their moral judgment of their sister's actions. However, Amy's professional ethics are separate from the author's personal feelings. The author might not be in the wrong in their own view, but they are enforcing their values on a family member who has her own responsibilities.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of their moral stance, but they are cutting off a family member for professional decisions that are legally and ethically appropriate. However, the line between personal feelings and professional ethics is blurred here. The author's actions are a personal choice, but whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on perspective. If the question is about whether cutting contact is justified, it's a personal decision, but if it's about whether the author is wrong in their judgment, it's more about differing values.\n\nThe answer would likely lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they have the right to make personal decisions about their relationships based on their values. However, others might argue that the author is overstepping by expecting a professional to act against her ethical duties. In the AITA framework, sometimes the person is considered \"not the asshole\" if their actions are based on their own values, even if others disagree. So the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
