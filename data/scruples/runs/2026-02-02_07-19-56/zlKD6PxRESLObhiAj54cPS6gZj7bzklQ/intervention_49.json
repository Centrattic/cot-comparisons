We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister Amy because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a sister, Jane, who's been arrested for fraud. They're close to their other sister, Amy, who's a defense attorney and is representing Jane pro bono. The author believes Jane is guilty and is upset that Amy isn't trying to prove her guilt, instead focusing on winning regardless of ethics. The author threatens to cut off contact if Amy doesn't do the \"right thing,\" which leads to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are the author's motivation and the ethical implications. The author is upset because they think Jane is guilty and that Amy is being unethical by defending her aggressively. But Amy is doing her job as an attorney, which is to defend her client to the best of her ability, regardless of personal feelings or the client's guilt. Attorneys have a duty to their clients, not to the public or their family's moral standards.\n\nThe author is essentially asking Amy to act unethically by not fighting for Jane's defense as a defense attorney should. By threatening to cut off contact, the author is putting personal morals above professional ethics. Amy's career choices and how she practices her profession are her own, and the author shouldn't dictate that, especially since Amy is within her rights to defend any client she chooses.\n\nHowever, the author's frustration is understandable given the family context. But the real issue is whether the author is in the wrong for cutting contact. Since Amy is doing her job, and the author is imposing their moral expectations on her profession, the author might be overstepping. The author's actions are based on personal feelings about Jane, not on any ethical violation by Amy in her professional role. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for cutting off Amy over this.\n"
