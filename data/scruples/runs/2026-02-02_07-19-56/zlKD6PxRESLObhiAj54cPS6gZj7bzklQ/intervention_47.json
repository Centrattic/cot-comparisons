We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister, Amy, over her defending their other sister Jane, who's guilty of fraud.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author believes Jane is guilty. Amy, their sister and an attorney, is representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because Amy isn't trying to prove Jane's guilt and is instead focusing on winning the case, even if that means getting Jane a lighter sentence. The author threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do what they see as the \"right thing.\" Amy gets defensive, saying she's doing this for her career, not because of family ties.\n\nNow, the author is wondering if they're in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. \n\nLegally, Amy is doing her job. As an attorney, her duty is to her client, Jane, and she must zealously represent her, regardless of personal feelings. So Amy's actions are professional obligations. The author is frustrated because they think Amy isn't being ethical, but in legal terms, Amy is just doing her job. \n\nThe author's threat to cut off Amy is based on personal morals conflicting with professional ethics. The author's stance is that Amy should be helping the justice system by getting Jane convicted, but Amy's job is to defend Jane, not to act as a prosecutor. \n\nThe author's reaction might be seen as overstepping. They're pressuring Amy to act against her professional duties for the author's moral standards. Cutting off a relationship is a big step, but the author is in a family conflict where their values clash with Amy's professional role. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that Amy is being unethical, but in reality, Amy is following the rules of her profession. The author might not realize that an attorney's job is to defend the client, not to determine guilt. So the author is wrong in expecting Amy to act against her professional obligations. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off Amy based on her job performance, even if they disagree with it.\n"
