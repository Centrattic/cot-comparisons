We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's sister Jane was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their younger sister Amy, who is a defense attorney. Amy is representing Jane pro bono. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty, and Amy is choosing to defend her without trying to prove her guilt. The author is considering cutting off Amy if she doesn't \"do the right thing,\" which in this context probably means getting Jane convicted.\n\nThe author thinks Jane is guilty, and Amy knows that too. But Amy is focusing on winning the case, not on proving guilt. The author is frustrated that Amy isn't trying to make Jane face consequences. They argue about this, and the author threatens to cut off contact if Amy doesn't act as they believe she should. Amy gets angry and leaves. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for this.\n\nNow, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but is seeking opinions. I need to evaluate if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, consider the ethical obligations of an attorney. As a defense lawyer, Amy's job is to defend her client, regardless of the client's guilt or the lawyer's personal beliefs. The attorney's role is to ensure a fair trial and protect the client's rights. Even if the client is guilty, the lawyer must do their best to represent them. This is part of the legal system's structure to prevent wrongful convictions and ensure due process. So, from a professional standpoint, Amy is doing her job correctly.\n\nThe author, however, is expecting Amy to act beyond her professional duty. They want her to ensure Jane is convicted, which is the prosecutor's role, not the defense attorney's. The author's frustration stems from their personal feelings about Jane's guilt and their belief that Amy isn't doing the \"right\" thing by defending her. But legally, Amy is within her rights to defend Jane as any other client.\n\nThe author is considering cutting off contact with Amy over this. This is a personal decision, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making such a decision. The author's perspective is based on their belief that Amy is enabling Jane's wrongdoing by providing a good defense. However, Amy is fulfilling her professional obligations, which are separate from the author's personal views.\n\nIs the author wrong for wanting to cut off their sister because of Amy's professional choices? Well, family dynamics are complex. The author is close to Amy, but their relationship is being strained by this issue. The author's moral stance is that Jane should face consequences, and they believe Amy should help in that. However, Amy's role is to provide a defense, not to act as a prosecutor or moral arbiter.\n\nThe author might feel betrayed, but Amy is acting within the bounds of her profession. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, as they are holding Amy to a personal standard that conflicts with her professional duties. The author is imposing their values on Amy's professional conduct, which may not be fair.\n\nAdditionally, the author is threatening to cut off contact based on Amy's job performance, which might be a harsh response. While the author has the right to their feelings, cutting off a family member over a professional disagreement could be considered extreme. However, the author's perspective is that their sister is making unethical choices, so they might feel justified.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to assess whether the person's actions are objectively wrong. Here, the author's action (cutting off Amy) is a personal choice based on their moral stance. Since attorneys are ethically bound to defend all clients, including those they believe are guilty, Amy is acting correctly. The author's frustration is understandable but doesn't make their potential action right. However, whether they are \"in the wrong\" depends on whether cutting off Amy is a justifiable reaction to Amy's professional conduct. Since Amy is doing her job, the author's anger might be misplaced. The author is not in the wrong for feeling this way, but the act of cutting off their sister might be seen as a personal choice rather than a moral wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because Amy is fulfilling her professional duty, and the author's reaction, while perhaps extreme, is a personal decision based on their values. The author's actions are a result of their personal beliefs and family dynamics, not a legal or ethical misstep on their part.\n"
