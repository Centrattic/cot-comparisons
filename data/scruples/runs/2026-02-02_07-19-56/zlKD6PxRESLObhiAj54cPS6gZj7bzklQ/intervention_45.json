We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's sister, Jane, is a fraud and might have committed another crime. The author's other sister, Amy, is her attorney and is defending her, even though she knows Jane is guilty. The author is upset about this and threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't act \"rightly.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. As an attorney, Amy has a duty to her client, Jane, to provide a vigorous defense, regardless of the client's guilt. That's part of the legal system\u2014everyone deserves a defense. If Amy were to try to get Jane to confess or work with the prosecution, she might be violating her duty as a defense attorney. She could face disciplinary action for that. So from a legal standpoint, Amy is doing her job as she should.\n\nThen there's the family dynamic. The author feels that Amy is being unethical, but maybe Amy is just doing what she's trained to do. The author is upset because they believe Jane is guilty and that Amy's actions are helping a guilty person avoid punishment. But Amy's responsibility isn't to the family; it's to her client and the legal system. She's not ethically obligated to let the prosecution win just because she's family.\n\nThe author is threatening to cut contact, which is a personal choice. However, is that justified? The author is disappointed and angry, but can they blame Amy for doing her job? The author might see it as betrayal, but Amy's actions are professional. The author might also be projecting their own moral views onto Amy, expecting her to act a certain way regardless of her professional ethics.\n\nAlso, Amy's comment about wanting to represent people like Jane because it's a \"black and white\" case could be a bit of a simplification. Legal cases are rarely that straightforward, but Amy might be taking a strategic approach. The author might not understand the nuances of her job, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is with Amy's professional choices, which are within her rights and duties. The author is in conflict between their personal feelings and Amy's professional ethics. The author's threat to cut contact is a personal decision, but isn't necessarily wrong because they're prioritizing their moral stance over family. However, is the author in the wrong for cutting contact? It's their choice, but maybe they should consider that Amy is doing her job as required.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are based on their disapproval of Amy's professional conduct, which is legally and ethically appropriate. The author is upset, but Amy isn't doing anything wrong in her role. Therefore, the author might be the one being unreasonable for expecting Amy to act against her professional duties. However, the author isn't in the wrong for having those feelings and making a personal choice to cut contact. It's a complex situation where both parties have valid perspectives, but Amy's actions are within her professional obligations. So, the author isn't in the wrong for their reaction, even if they might not fully understand Amy's professional stance.\n"
