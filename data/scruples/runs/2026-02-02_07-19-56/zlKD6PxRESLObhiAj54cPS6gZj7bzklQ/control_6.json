We've had a strained relationship my whole life, but I am very close to my younger sister, Amy, who's a criminal defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane, pro-bono, and of course, Jane accepted.\n\nThis is where I run into a problem. Jane and I have a fraught relationship for many reasons, one of them being that I think she completely lacks impulse control and a moral code. Jane does things that are objectively morally incorrect, with no thought or remorse. She constantly steals. All of her relationships are built on lies, and 90% of what she tells anybody is untrue.\n\nI know that Jane is guilty. Everybody knows she's guilty, even Amy. Jane has never tried to state her innocence. I asked her if she had done it, and she just shrugged and told me that she's \"guilty of a lot of things.\"\n\nLast night, Amy and I were discussing Jane's case, and I asked her if she thought that Jane was innocent. Amy said no, she was confident that Jane had done this. I agreed, and said it might be good for her to go to prison, so she could see that her actions have consequences. Then, Amy said that she wasn't going to try and prove Jane guilty. She said that because Jane had never technically confessed and there was insufficient evidence, she was confident that Jane would be able to get away with it. I was kind of horrified. I asked her again if she thought that Jane was guilty, and again, she said she felt that Jane was guilty. I asked why she wouldn't get her to confess or at least get her some community service time.\n\nAmy told me that she doesn't want to play nice with prosecutors. She wants to win, and she doesn't care how she looks while doing it. She even said she wants to represent the next O.J. I told her it was a bad idea, because it would drive away business, and she said she doesn't want to represent people like me. She wants to represent people like Jane, who give her the most black and white case, and allow her to turn it around for them. I asked if she was only doing it because Jane is our sister, but she told me again that she wants to be successful. Amy has always been competitive, but it's sort of scary to see her like this. I said she was a shark, and that nobody in the family would want to speak to her after the trail was over, and I said I would cut contact if she didn't do the right thing.\n\nOf course, Amy got mad, and told me that I was being overly critical because I want to be nice and complicit. She started saying that because she's a woman, no one else at her firm will take her seriously, and this is her opportunity to prove herself, but I said again, this was just going to get her into more trouble than it was worth. She got mad, told me I was being an ass, and left.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAITA? Is she just doing what she has to do?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off their sister because of her decisions as an attorney.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's older sister, Jane, was arrested for fraud. The author is close to their younger sister, Amy, who is a defense attorney. Amy offered to represent Jane pro-bono. The author thinks Jane is guilty and immoral, and Jane herself admitted guilt. However, Amy, despite believing Jane is guilty, is going to defend her zealously to win the case, even going as far as comparing herself to O.J. Simpson's defense. The author is upset that Amy isn't trying to get Jane to confess or face consequences, and threatens to cut contact if Amy doesn't do the right thing. Amy gets angry and they argue.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author's actions are based on their moral judgment of Jane and Amy's professional role. But as an attorney, Amy has an ethical duty to defend her client to the best of her ability, even if she believes the client is guilty. The American justice system is adversarial, and the defense attorney's job isn't to determine guilt but to ensure the prosecution meets the burden of proof. So Amy might be doing her job correctly, even if the author disagrees morally.\n\nThe author's threat to cut off Amy could be seen as a personal choice, but they might be misunderstanding Amy's professional obligations. The author might be in the wrong for pressuring Amy to act against her professional ethics. However, the author is also upset because they feel Amy is being unethical. But in reality, Amy is doing her job, which is to defend Jane, not to act as a moral judge.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to be upset with Amy's decision, but Amy's actions are within her professional duties. The author's decision to cut off contact is their choice, based on their values, and they aren't wrong for that. However, there's a nuance that the author might have a misunderstanding of legal ethics, but the question is whether they are in the wrong, not whether they understand the system correctly.\n"
