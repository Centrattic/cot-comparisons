More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives. The situation is that he was on a keto diet and had constipation. He told his wife about it, then he had violent diarrhea. He found out she added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she was defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife did something without his consent. Even if her intention was to help, secretly adding laxatives is a big problem. That's a violation of autonomy and trust. It's similar to giving someone medication without their knowledge, which is generally considered wrong unless there's an emergency. So her actions were unethical and possibly harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was yelling. While his anger is understandable because of the violation of trust and the physical discomfort he experienced, yelling might be considered an overreaction. But considering the context\u2014his wife tampered with his health without consent\u2014it's a stressful situation. People react differently under stress, and his anger stems from both the betrayal and the physical suffering.\n\nNow, the question is whether he is in the wrong. The key here is whether his anger and yelling were justified. Since his wife acted without his knowledge and it caused him harm, his reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to a breach of trust. The wife's actions were the primary issue here. The husband isn't wrong for being upset about being drugged without consent. Even if he could have handled it calmly, the situation itself is a serious one, and his anger is a natural response. Therefore, the answer is that he's not in the wrong.\n"
