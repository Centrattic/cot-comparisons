More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The situation is that he's on a keto diet and was constipated, so he told his wife. She then put too much laxative in his protein shake, leading to violent diarrhea. He got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The wife did something without his consent, even though her intention was to help. But giving someone medication or supplements without their knowledge is a big deal. That's a breach of trust and autonomy. She might have thought she was helping, but doing so without permission can be seen as manipulative or harmful, especially if it caused severe side effects.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was to get angry and yell. While his reaction is understandable given the violation of trust and the physical distress he experienced, yelling and getting angry is a natural response to being betrayed. But is he in the wrong for reacting that way? Well, the question is whether he's at fault. The wife's actions were the root cause here. She acted without his consent, which is a problem regardless of her intentions. The author's anger is a response to her actions, so he's not necessarily in the wrong for being upset. However, maybe he could have handled it without yelling, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it perfectly.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife did something wrong by secretly giving him something that caused harm. The author's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to that wrongdoing. So the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The wrong here is more on the wife's side for not respecting his autonomy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
