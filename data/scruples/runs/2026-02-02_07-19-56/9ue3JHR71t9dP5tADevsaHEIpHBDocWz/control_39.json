More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly put laxative powder in his protein shake.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. She then secretly added laxative powder to his shake. He ended up with severe diarrhea, got angry, and yelled at her. She defended herself by saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was the wife's action wrong? She didn't inform him about adding the laxatives, which could be seen as a violation of trust. Secretly giving someone medication or supplements without their knowledge is a big deal, especially when it leads to adverse effects. The husband had a negative reaction, which was severe enough to cause distress. \n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and yelling. While yelling is not ideal, the context is that he was in a lot of discomfort, and his wife acted without his consent. His anger could be justified because of the lack of communication and the harmful outcome.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If we consider that he was upset due to the wife's unauthorized action causing harm, then maybe not. However, his response of yelling might be seen as overreacting. But the root cause is the wife's action, which is questionable. \n\nThe wife's intent was to help, but the method was wrong. She didn't consult him, leading to a bad outcome. So the husband's anger is a reaction to her breach of trust and the physical harm. \n\nIn terms of fault, the wife's action was the initial wrong. The husband's yelling is a reaction, but whether he's in the wrong depends on if his response was disproportionate. However, given the circumstances, his anger might be understandable. So the answer would likely be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's another angle. \n\nMaybe some would say he should have handled it calmly. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife did something without consent and he had a valid reason to be upset, the husband isn't necessarily wrong for being angry. So the answer is B.\n"
