More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements he was taking but found no warnings. After checking online, he confronted his wife, who admitted she added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she was defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife acted without his consent, possibly causing harm. The husband felt betrayed and got angry. The question is whether he's in the wrong for his reaction.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the wife did something without his permission. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without consent can be seen as crossing a boundary. The husband's anger might be a natural reaction to being manipulated without knowing, leading to discomfort or harm. However, his response was yelling and getting angry, which could be considered an overreaction depending on the context. But considering the context of someone secretly altering his food/drink to administer medication without consent, which could have health risks, the husband's anger might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife should have discussed this with him first. But the husband's reaction of yelling might have been harsh. However, given the violation of trust and the physical distress caused, his anger isn't entirely unwarranted. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife's action was the initial problem, the husband's anger is a reaction. The problem is whether the reaction is wrong. If the husband's anger is in response to a breach of trust and harm without consent, then maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
