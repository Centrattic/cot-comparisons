More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at their wife after finding out she secretly gave them laxatives. \n\nFirst, the context: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. Later, he has violent diarrhea after taking fiber supplements. When he checks the product online, there's no mention of such a side effect. He confronts his wife, who laughs and then admits she added too much laxative powder to his shake. The husband gets angry and yells at her, and the wife is defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife acted without his consent, even though her intention was to help. However, the method she used\u2014secretly adding laxatives\u2014could be seen as a violation of trust and autonomy. The husband's reaction is anger and yelling, which the question is whether that's justified.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, being poisoned or having something secretly administered in his food/shake without his knowledge would naturally cause anger. The wife's action, regardless of her intent, is a form of manipulation and could be dangerous, even if she meant well. The husband has a right to be upset about his autonomy being violated and the potential health risks.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might have thought she was helping, but without discussing it with him first. Her laughter when confronted could be seen as dismissive, which might have escalated the situation. However, the husband's yelling might be an overreaction, depending on the tone and context. But given that the wife acted without consent and it led to a harmful experience, the husband's anger is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife's action was wrong because she didn't get his consent. The husband's reaction is a response to being deceived and potentially harmed. While yelling can be a poor way to express anger, given the circumstances, it's not necessarily that he's in the wrong. The question is whether he's overreacting. The wife's secret action is a significant breach, so the husband's reaction, while intense, isn't entirely unwarranted.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the wife's actions were the primary issue, and while yelling is not ideal, the husband's anger is a reaction to being manipulated and harmed without his consent.\n"
