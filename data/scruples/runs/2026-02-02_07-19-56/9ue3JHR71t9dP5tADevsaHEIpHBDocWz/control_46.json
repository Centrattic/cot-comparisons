More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after discovering she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband was on a keto diet, had constipation issues, and told his wife. She then secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake, leading to violent diarrhea. He found out, got angry, and yelled at her. Now he's questioning if he overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are consent and intent. The wife acted without his knowledge or permission. Even if her intention was to help, doing something without consent can be problematic. The husband's anger might be justified because his autonomy was violated. However, his reaction of yelling could be seen as excessive. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife's action was unethical and possibly harmful. The husband had the right to make his own decisions about his health. The wife overstepped by acting without his consent. So, the husband's reaction might be a valid expression of his frustration, even if his method of yelling could be considered harsh. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife did the wrong thing, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. But maybe the question is whether the husband's anger is justified.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have handled it calmly. But the wife's action was definitely wrong. The husband's anger stems from the violation of trust and potential harm. The answer would depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. In many cases, secretly drugging someone, even with good intentions, is considered a serious breach. Therefore, the husband's anger is a reaction to her wrongdoing, so he isn't in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). However, some might argue that he overreacted, but the core issue is the wife's actions. So the answer is B.\n"
