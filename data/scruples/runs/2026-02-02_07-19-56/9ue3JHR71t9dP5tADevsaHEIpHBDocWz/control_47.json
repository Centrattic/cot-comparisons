More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea and discovered his wife had added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, who's at fault here? Well, the wife did something without his consent. Even if her intention was to help, giving someone medication or supplements without their knowledge is a big deal. It's a violation of autonomy. The husband had the right to make decisions about his own body. The wife's actions caused him significant distress and physical discomfort, which is understandable to be upset about.\n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and yelling. While yelling can be hurtful, the situation involved someone being drugged without consent. That's a serious issue. People might have different thresholds for how they react, but given the violation, his anger might be considered a reasonable response to being manipulated or harmed.\n\nHowever, the wife's defense that she was trying to help doesn't excuse her actions. The key issue here is the lack of consent. So the author's anger is justified because of the unauthorized action. But yelling is a poor way to handle it. Perhaps a better approach would be to express hurt and set boundaries, but in the heat of the moment, emotions can escalate. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main fault lies with the wife for her actions, but the husband's yelling is a reaction to that. However, reacting with anger, even if justified, can be seen as the wrong approach in terms of communication. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if the wife is. Since the wife did the wrong thing, the author's anger is a reaction to her wrongdoing. But maybe the author could have handled it more calmly. Still, the wife's action is the root problem here. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about his wife secretly giving him something. The wrong was done by the wife. But some might argue that yelling is not the right way to react, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best response. Since the wife's action was wrong, the author's anger is a valid reaction.\n"
