More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at their wife after finding out she secretly gave him laxatives. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this, and later had severe diarrhea. When he checked his supplements, he found out his wife had added laxative powder to his protein shake without his consent.\n\nThe key issues here are consent and the right to make decisions about one's own body. The wife's action of adding laxatives without asking is a big deal because it's a medical decision. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without consent is a violation of autonomy. The husband's reaction, while angry and involving yelling, is a response to being deceived and having something done to him without his knowledge. \n\nHowever, the husband's reaction is also important. Yelling and getting angry might be understandable given the situation, especially if he felt betrayed or that his health was compromised. But is he in the wrong? If the wife's action was wrong (secretly adding medication without consent), then the husband's anger is a justified reaction. However, yelling and being confrontational could escalate the situation, but it's a natural emotional response to betrayal. \n\nThe question is whether the husband's anger makes him at fault. If the wife's action was inconsiderate and invasive, then the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer would be B (No). However, if the husband should have handled it calmly instead of yelling, maybe A (Yes). But the core issue is the wife's unauthorized action, so the husband's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
