More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. I need to figure out if he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea after taking fiber supplements. He checked the product online but didn't find mentions of that. Then his wife admitted she added too much laxative powder to his shake, thinking she was helping. The husband got angry and yelled, and the wife got defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here. The wife did something without his consent\u2014adding laxative to his shake. That's a big deal because it's a medication and can have serious side effects. The husband had a severe reaction, which was violent diarrhea. He was upset because he didn't know she did that, and when he found out, he yelled at her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nThe wife's actions: She was trying to help, but she did it without his knowledge. That's a breach of trust. She didn't ask if he wanted help, just assumed and took action. Even if her intention was good, the fact that she didn't consult him and caused harm is problematic. Secretly adding medication to someone's food or drink is a serious issue. It's like medical tampering, which can have legal and ethical implications.\n\nThe husband's reaction: He got angry and yelled. His anger is understandable because he was physically harmed without his consent. However, yelling at her could be seen as overreacting, but considering the context, maybe not entirely. He was in a lot of pain and surprised by her action. People can react strongly when they discover someone has been manipulating their health without permission.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The wife's actions were a violation of trust and autonomy. She shouldn't have done that. Therefore, the main issue is her actions, not his reaction. His anger is a response to her wrongdoing. So, he's not in the wrong here. The answer would be B (he's not in the wrong). However, maybe there's a nuance. If he yelled in a way that was abusive or disproportionate, perhaps. But given the situation, his reaction seems justified as he was physically harmed and betrayed. So, his anger is a result of her actions. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
