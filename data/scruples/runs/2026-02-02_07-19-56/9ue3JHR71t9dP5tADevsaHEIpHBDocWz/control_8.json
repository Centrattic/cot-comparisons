More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The situation is that the husband was on a keto diet and had constipation. He told his wife, but she secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake, which caused violent diarrhea. He got angry and yelled at her, and she defended herself by saying she was trying to help. The question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The wife did something without his consent, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Adding laxatives without telling him is a big deal because it can have health consequences. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling, which could be a normal response to being betrayed or to experiencing physical harm. However, yelling and getting angry is a form of reacting, but is it justified?\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's intention was to help, but her method was wrong. She didn't consult him, which is a problem. The husband has the right to make decisions about his own body. By adding laxatives without permission, she overstepped. His anger might be a reaction to the violation of trust and the physical discomfort he went through.\n\nIs the husband overreacting? Maybe not. If someone does something to you without your consent that causes harm, getting upset is understandable. However, yelling could be seen as an aggressive response. But in the context of being betrayed and physically affected, it's hard to say he's entirely wrong. The question is whether he is in the wrong. The wife's actions were the initial problem, so the husband's anger is a reaction to her wrongdoing. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
