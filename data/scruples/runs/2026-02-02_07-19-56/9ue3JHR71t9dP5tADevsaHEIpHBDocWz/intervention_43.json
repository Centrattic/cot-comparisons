More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife secretly gave him laxatives in his protein shake. He got really upset and yelled at her. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the wife's actions. She did something without his consent. Adding laxatives without telling him is a big deal because it's about his personal health. Even if she meant to help with his constipation from the keto diet, she shouldn't have done it without his knowledge. That's a violation of trust and autonomy. So, the wife is definitely at fault here.\n\nNow, the author's reaction. He got angry and yelled. That's a common reaction when someone does something invasive without permission. But is he overreacting? Well, being angry is understandable, but yelling might be seen as an overreaction. However, considering the context\u2014his health was compromised, he was in pain, and it's a breach of trust\u2014it's hard to say he's entirely wrong. But maybe he could have handled it without yelling. However, when you're in physical distress and find out someone manipulated your health without consent, getting angry isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The author's anger is a response to a breach, which is a valid emotion. The wife's action was the primary issue. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), because the wife's actions were the main problem, and the author's anger is a reaction to that. But I need to check if yelling is justified. Yelling can be harmful, but in this context, it's a reaction to being deceived in a harmful way. It's a tricky situation. Some might say he should have stayed calm, but others might empathize with his anger. Since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the fact that the wife did something wrong first could mean he's not entirely at fault. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
