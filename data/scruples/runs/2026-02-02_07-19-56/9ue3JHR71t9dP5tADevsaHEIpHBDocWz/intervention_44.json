More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for yelling at their wife for secretly giving them laxatives. \n\nFirst, the context: the husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. The wife added laxative powder to his protein shake without telling him. He ends up with violent diarrhea, checks the product, and when confronted, she laughs and then admits she might have put too much. He yells at her, and she gets defensive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the wife did something without his consent. That's a big deal. People have the right to know what's going into their body, especially medications or supplements. Even if her intention was to help, doing it secretly is a violation of autonomy and trust. Her actions could have caused harm, and she didn't even consult him first. That's a serious breach.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband reacted with anger and yelling. That's a valid emotional response to being drugged without consent, but the way he handled it could have been better. Yelling might escalate the situation and hurt the relationship. He could have expressed his anger in a more constructive way, maybe after calming down.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the right to bodily autonomy. The wife's actions were a major overstep, so the husband's anger is justified. But his reaction (yelling) might not be the healthiest way to address it. However, in terms of blame, the primary fault lies with the wife for acting without permission. So, the husband isn't in the wrong for being angry, even if his response could be improved. The question is whether he's in the wrong for the anger and yelling. Since the wife's action was the root cause, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but I need to consider if his reaction is proportionate. \n\nBut wait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's because they see his yelling as the issue. However, given the context of being drugged without consent, yelling is a reaction to betrayal. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
