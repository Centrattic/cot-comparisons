More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got angry and yelled at his wife for secretly putting laxatives in his protein shake, leading to severe diarrhea.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The husband was constipated from keto, so he started taking fiber supplements. Then he had a bad reaction, which led him to investigate. He found out the wife added too much laxative powder without his knowledge. He got angry and yelled, and she was defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nThe wife's actions: She put laxatives into his shake without his consent. That's a big deal because it's a medical decision that affects someone else's health. Even if she meant well, she didn't ask and made a choice that could have harmful consequences. Introducing a drug into someone's food without their knowledge is a violation of trust and autonomy.\n\nThe husband's reaction: He was upset because he experienced severe diarrhea, which is painful and distressing. He found out the cause was his wife's action. He got angry and yelled. Is that an overreaction? Well, being angry when someone messes with your health without consent is understandable. However, yelling could be seen as a harsh response. The question is whether the anger is justified given the breach of trust.\n\nBut wait, the wife was trying to help, but the method was wrong. The husband's reaction is to the action of her putting laxatives in his food without consent, not just the result. So even if her intention was good, the act was wrong. The husband's anger is in response to her unauthorized action causing harm. So the author's anger is about her taking control over his health decisions. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong for yelling? Maybe not entirely. People can react strongly when they feel betrayed or harmed. But yelling is a form of aggression. However, the wife's actions were the root cause. If the wife had been honest, perhaps the situation could have been discussed calmly. But since she was secretive and then laughed and got defensive when confronted, that might have escalated the husband's anger. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the wife's action is questionable. The husband's reaction is a result of that. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The wife made a bad decision by not getting consent. The husband's anger is a reaction to that. While yelling might not be the best way to handle it, the initial wrongdoing is on the wife's part. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Answer B (No) would be correct."
