More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their wife because she secretly gave them laxatives. The situation is that the husband was on a keto diet and had constipation, so he told his wife. Then he had a bad reaction to something he thought was fiber supplements. His wife, without his knowledge, put too much laxative powder in his protein shake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband had a legitimate reason to be upset because he was harmed physically. Secretly adding something to his food without his consent is a major issue. It's a violation of autonomy and trust. His reaction of getting angry and yelling might be intense, but the wife's actions were definitely wrong. She shouldn't have done that without his knowledge. The husband had a right to be upset because she acted without his consent and caused him distress. However, yelling might be seen as an overreaction, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The key points are consent and the physical harm caused. The wife's intention was to help, but the method was wrong. The husband's anger is a response to her breach of trust. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry; the fault lies with the wife for her secret action. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
