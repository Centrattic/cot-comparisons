More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly putting laxatives in his protein shake. So the situation is that he was on a keto diet and had constipation issues. He told his wife about it, and then he ended up with violent diarrhea. When he checked the fiber supplements he was taking, there were no warnings about that. His wife confessed she added too much laxative powder to his shake.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out who's at fault here. The wife did something without his consent. Even if her intention was to help, she acted without his permission, which is a big deal. Adding laxatives to someone's food or drink is a serious violation of trust and autonomy. So the wife is definitely wrong there. \n\nThen the author got angry and yelled at her. He might be justified in feeling upset because someone manipulated his health without his knowledge. But the question is whether he was in the wrong for yelling. Yelling is a form of expressing anger, which can be inappropriate if it's excessive or harmful, but given the situation, it's understandable. However, the key point is that the wife did something wrong first. \n\nThe author's reaction might be considered a natural emotional response to being deceived and possibly harmed. However, it's possible that he overreacted. But in terms of moral wrongdoing, the primary fault lies with the wife for acting secretly. The author's anger, while perhaps intense, is a reaction to her actions. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), because the wife acted without consent, and his reaction, while maybe intense, is understandable given the violation.\n"
