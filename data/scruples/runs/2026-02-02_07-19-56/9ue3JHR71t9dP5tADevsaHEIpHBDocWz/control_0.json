More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The scenario is that he was on a keto diet, had constipation, took fiber supplements, ended up with violent diarrhea. When he checked, his wife admitted she put too much laxative powder in his protein shake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife did something without his consent. Even if her intention was to help, giving someone a laxative without their knowledge is a privacy violation. The husband got very angry and yelled, which led to conflict.\n\nIs the husband overreacting? Well, the situation caused physical discomfort and distress. The wife's action was sneaky and could have been harmful. The husband's anger might be justified because of the invasion of privacy and the physical harm caused. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction. But then again, if someone secretly harms you, getting upset is a natural response.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have handled it calmly. But given the sudden and severe reaction, it's understandable he was angry. The wife's defense that she was trying to help doesn't excuse her actions without consent. So the author's anger might be justified, but his method of confronting her (yelling) could be considered wrong because it's aggressive. However, if the wife was aware of the problem and still did it, maybe the husband's reaction is a valid expression of being wronged.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether his anger and yelling are justified. Since the wife acted without consent, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong. But yelling might be seen as his fault. But maybe the core issue is the wife's actions, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B, No.\n"
