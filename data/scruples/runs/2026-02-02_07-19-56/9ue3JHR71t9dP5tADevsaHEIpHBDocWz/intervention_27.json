More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. The wife then secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband ended up with violent diarrhea, which he initially thought was from the fiber supplements he was taking. When he found out his wife had done this, he got angry and yelled at her. The wife defended herself by saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points are: the wife acted without consent, which is a big deal. The husband had informed her about his constipation, but she took it upon herself to administer a laxative without discussing it with him. That's a violation of his autonomy. However, her intention was to help, which complicates things. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling, which might be seen as overreacting depending on the context. But was his anger justified?\n\nOn one hand, the wife's action was invasive and deceptive. Even if her motives were good, doing something without consent can be harmful. The husband had the right to make decisions about his own body. On the other hand, the husband might not have communicated his concerns clearly. If he had told her that he didn't want any unsupervised additions to his diet, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But the wife's action was definitely a breach of trust.\n\nNow, considering the husband's reaction. Yelling in anger is a common response when someone feels betrayed or harmed. The severity of the reaction (violent diarrhea) could justify some level of anger. However, yelling and getting angry might not be the most constructive response. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife did something wrong, so the husband's anger is a reaction to her wrongdoing. That being said, yelling could still be seen as an overreaction, especially if there were better ways to address the situation, like calmly discussing the issue. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the wife's action was definitely questionable. The husband's reaction might be seen as a justified emotional response to being deceived and harmed. However, he could have communicated his feelings in a more constructive way. But does that make him in the wrong? If the wife did something wrong, then the husband's anger is a valid reaction. However, yelling and becoming angry might be seen as an overreaction, especially if he didn't consider her intentions. But the wife's actions were secretive and potentially harmful. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the wife acted without consent, which is a significant issue. The husband's anger stems from being betrayed and possibly harmed. So, while yelling isn't the best approach, he isn't entirely in the wrong because the wife did something wrong. However, maybe the husband could have handled it better. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the wife's actions were the root problem. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
