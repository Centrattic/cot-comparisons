More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly adding laxative powder to his protein shake.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario step by step. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He mentioned this to his wife. Later, he had severe diarrhea and checked the fiber supplements he was taking, finding no warnings about that effect. He confronted his wife, who admitted she might have added too much laxative powder to his shake.\n\nThe key points here are: the wife acted without his knowledge, using laxatives without his consent. The husband then got angry and yelled at her. The question is whether he's in the wrong for his reaction.\n\nSo, the wife's action was unauthorized. Even if her intention was to help, giving someone medication or supplements without their knowledge is a big deal. It's a form of medical autonomy violation. The husband had the right to know what he was ingesting, especially since it's affecting his health. The wife's actions could have caused significant harm, even if unintended. \n\nThe husband's reaction was to get angry and yell. While yelling can be seen as an aggressive response, it's important to consider the context. He experienced severe diarrhea, which was distressing, and found out his wife had secretly given him something that caused this. His anger might stem from not being informed and the potential health risks. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife made a decision without discussing it with him, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband has the right to be upset about that. However, yelling might not be the best way to address the issue, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, the wife's action was more problematic because she acted without consent. The husband's anger is a reaction to her action, which could be justified. However, the way he expressed his anger (yelling) might be seen as excessive, but considering the situation, it's a common reaction when someone's health is affected without their consent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't in the wrong. The wife's actions were the main issue here. The husband's response, while perhaps not the most composed, is a reaction to unauthorized medical intervention. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
