More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for giving him laxatives without telling him. \n\nFirst, the situation: He's on a keto diet and was constipated. He told his wife about it. She secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake, which resulted in severe diarrhea. He got angry and yelled at her, and she defended herself by saying she was trying to help. The question is whether the author is overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here. The wife did something without his consent, which is generally a big no-no. Even if her intentions were good, she didn't communicate with him about it. He had a negative reaction, which was violent diarrhea. That's not just a minor inconvenience\u2014it's a serious physical reaction that can be alarming and painful. \n\nHe found out the cause himself by checking the product, which shows he was trying to figure out what was wrong. When he confronted his wife, she laughed, which might have escalated his anger. Her laughter could be seen as dismissive of his genuine distress. Then, when he asked why she did it, she admitted to possibly overdoing it. \n\nNow, the question is about whether he overreacted by yelling. If someone does something to you without your consent that causes you harm, even if they mean well, that's a problem. The husband's anger is a reaction to being manipulated and potentially harmed. Yelling might be an inappropriate expression of that anger, but the underlying action (secretly giving him laxatives) is definitely wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled it without yelling. But given the situation\u2014being physically harmed without consent\u2014his anger is understandable. The line between being right and wrong here is in how he expressed his anger versus the act of her doing it without permission. \n\nSo, the wife's actions are definitely in the wrong for not consulting him. The husband's yelling might be a valid reaction to being wronged, but maybe he could have communicated better. However, the main issue is her unauthorized action, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
