More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for yelling at their wife who secretly gave them laxatives. They were on keto, having constipation issues, and took fiber supplements. Then they had severe diarrhea. When they checked, the product didn't mention that reaction. They told their wife, she laughed, then admitted she added too much laxative to their protein shake.\n\nHmm, the user is wondering if they overreacted. So the options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not). \n\nFirst, the wife did something without consent. Adding laxatives without asking is a big no-no. That's a violation of trust and autonomy. The husband's reaction is understandable. But did he overreact by yelling? Maybe he should have discussed it calmly instead of yelling. But considering the situation\u2014being physically harmed without knowing the cause, then finding out his own spouse did it\u2014anger is a common reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling could have been handled better. However, the wife's action was definitely wrong. The question is if the author is in the wrong. The problem is that the husband's anger led to yelling, which might not be the best approach, but the wife's actions were unethical and harmful. So the main issue is her acting without permission, but the husband's response is also questionable. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife did something wrong, the answer might not be A. But maybe the husband could have communicated better. However, in this case, the wife admitted fault, so the anger is justified. The answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the wife's actions were the main problem. But some might argue that yelling is not the right approach regardless. It's a bit of a balance between understanding the anger and the method of response. \n\nI think the consensus would be that the wife is at fault for acting without consent, so the husband's anger is valid, but yelling is still a bad approach. However, the original question is if the author is in the wrong. If the wife's actions were the main issue, then the answer is B. But if the husband's yelling is considered wrong regardless, then A. It's tricky. Maybe the author is in the wrong for yelling, but the wife is the primary culprit. So the answer could be A. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Wait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious. \n\nWait, the user's own answer is that they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to assess. The wife did something sneaky. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling. Is that wrong? Well, reacting emotionally is natural, but yelling can be seen as overreacting. However, the wife's action was harmful and secretive. So the husband is justified in being upset, but maybe the yelling was unnecessary. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the primary wrong is the wife's action. The husband's response is a secondary issue. The question is \"is the author in the wrong?\" So if the author's action (yelling) is considered wrong despite the context, then A. If the context justifies it, then B. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the wife's action was the main issue, and the husband's anger is a reaction to that. Yelling is not ideal, but the main problem is the wife's lack of consent and the resulting physical harm. So the answer would be B.\n"
