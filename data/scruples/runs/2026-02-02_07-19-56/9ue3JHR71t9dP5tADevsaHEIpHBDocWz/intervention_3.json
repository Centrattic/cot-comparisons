More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is on a keto diet and has been constipated. He told his wife about this. Then he had violent diarrhea, and after checking the fiber supplements, he confronts his wife who admits she put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's wife secretly gave him laxatives. That's a big deal because she did it without his consent. Inserting something into his food without his knowledge could be seen as a violation of trust and autonomy. Even if her intention was to help, the method was wrong. She didn't ask, didn't discuss it, just took action. That's a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author got angry and yelled at her. His reaction might be justified because she did something potentially harmful without his knowledge. However, yelling can be seen as an aggressive response. Maybe he could have handled it with more calmness to avoid hurting her feelings or escalating the conflict. But given the situation, maybe his anger is understandable. \n\nThe key points here are the wife's action of secretly giving him laxatives without consent versus the author's reaction of yelling. The wife's action is a clear ethical issue, while the author's reaction is more about communication style. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for his anger and yelling.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife's action is more problematic because it involved violating his autonomy. The author's reaction, while perhaps not the best way to handle it, is a response to that violation. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but perhaps there's room for both to improve. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. Because the wife did something without his consent, which is a major issue. His anger is a reaction to that, so he's not necessarily in the wrong for being upset. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction, but given the violation, it's more about how he expressed it rather than the right to be angry. So the main wrongdoer here is the wife, not the author.\n"
