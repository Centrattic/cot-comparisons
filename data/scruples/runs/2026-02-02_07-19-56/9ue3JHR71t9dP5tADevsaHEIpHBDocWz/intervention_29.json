More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the husband getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea, which he initially blamed on fiber supplements. After checking, he found out his wife had added too much laxative to his protein shake, thinking she was helping him. The husband got angry and yelled at her, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong but wants to confirm. So, why would the husband be in the wrong? Well, the wife did try to help him, albeit in a secretive way. Maybe she didn't realize the dosage was too high. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling. Even if her actions were inappropriate, his response could be seen as over the top. However, the wife's action of secretly adding laxatives without consent is a problem. She violated his autonomy and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband had a valid reason to be upset because he was made to suffer without knowing the cause. His anger might be justified because he was manipulated without his knowledge. But yelling and being angry might not be the best way to handle it. The key here is whether the husband's reaction was proportionate. He was in a lot of pain and frustration, which could explain his outburst. \n\nBut the wife's actions were unethical and could be harmful. She shouldn't have taken it upon herself to adjust his medication or diet without consulting him. However, the husband's response of yelling could have been hurtful and counterproductive. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for his reaction. \n\nIn some perspectives, the wife's action is worse because it's a breach of trust. In others, the husband's reaction is a natural response to being betrayed and physically harmed. The user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, maybe because the wife's action was wrong, but maybe the husband overreacted. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband had a right to be upset about being deceived and harmed. However, responding with anger and yelling might not address the issue constructively. But the wife's action is indeed questionable. \n\nSo, is the author (husband) in the wrong? If the question is whether he is in the wrong for his anger and yelling, then maybe yes because he could have handled it better. But if the focus is on the wife's actions, then maybe he's not wrong. The user is asking specifically about the husband's response. The answer depends on whether his anger is justified. Given that his wife secretly harmed him, his anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it might be wrong. So the answer could be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he should have communicated better, or B (no) because his reaction is understandable. \n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is wrong. Maybe they consider that the wife's action is worse, so the husband's anger is justified. But the user is unsure. I need to decide based on the question. The question is: Is the author in the wrong for getting angry and yelling? If the answer is A, then the husband is wrong. If B, then he's not. \n\nGiven that the wife acted unethically, the husband's anger is a reaction to that. So maybe he's not wrong. But the way he expressed it (yelling) could be unhelpful. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which could be moral or legal. Since the wife broke his trust, the husband's anger might be justified. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But the user thinks A, so I need to check again.\n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know. So maybe the user thinks the husband overreacted. If I consider that the wife's intention was to help, even if she did it wrong, the husband's yelling is disproportionate. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit torn. The wife's action is wrong, but the husband's reaction might be a consequence. So perhaps the husband is not wrong for being angry, but the way he expressed it is. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. So if the husband's anger is justified, then he's not in the wrong. If his yelling is an overreaction, then he is. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (No), because the husband's reaction is understandable given the betrayal, even if yelling wasn't the best approach. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
