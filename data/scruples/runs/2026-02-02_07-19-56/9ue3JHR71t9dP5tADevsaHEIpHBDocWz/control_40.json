More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after discovering she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the wife added laxative powder to his protein shake without his consent. That's a big deal because it's a violation of autonomy. People have the right to know what's being put into their bodies, especially since laxatives can have side effects like the violent diarrhea he experienced. So, the wife's action is questionable and potentially harmful.\n\nThe husband got angry and yelled at her. His reaction is understandable given the situation. He was in physical distress, and finding out someone else intentionally caused that could make anyone upset. However, yelling might not be the best way to handle it. While he's justified in being upset, the manner in which he expressed his anger could be seen as over the top. Communication is key here; maybe he should have calmed down and discussed it more calmly to understand her intentions and express his feelings without escalating the conflict.\n\nThe wife's defense that she was \"just trying to help\" doesn't excuse her actions. Even with good intentions, acting without consent is a problem. She should have discussed any health interventions with him first. But his yelling might have been a reaction to both the unexpected laxatives and her laughing at his discomfort, which adds to the tension.\n\nIn terms of fault, the primary issue is the wife's action. The husband's reaction is a response to that. While he's not entirely wrong to be angry, his response could be considered an overreaction if it was yelling without giving her a chance to explain or if it was aggressive. However, given the context of physical harm and betrayal, his anger is somewhat justified. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the husband's anger is a reasonable response. Since the wife acted without permission, leading to his physical suffering, the husband isn't in the wrong for being angry. However, how he expressed that anger (yelling) might not be the best approach, but it doesn't make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
