More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their wife who secretly gave them laxatives. So the situation: he's on a keto diet and had constipation issues. He told his wife, and then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but didn't find any warnings. Then he found out his wife added laxative powder to his protein shake, which caused the problem. He got angry and yelled at her, she said she was trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife did something without his consent. Even if her intention was to help, giving someone a medication or supplement without asking is a big no-no. That's a violation of autonomy and can be dangerous. Laxatives can have side effects, and using too much can definitely cause issues like the diarrhea he experienced. Her actions were reckless, especially since she might have put in too much.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was yelling and getting angry. While his constipation was a problem, the wife's action was a direct cause of his severe discomfort. The husband had a right to be upset because his health was affected without his knowledge. However, yelling is an aggressive response. Instead of yelling, maybe he could have handled it calmly to discuss the issue. But given the circumstances, his anger is understandable because someone did something harmful to him without consent.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the wife's action was definitely wrong. The husband's reaction might be a bit harsh, but considering the privacy and autonomy violation, his anger is justified. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he yelled, that's not the best approach, but maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, the question is about whether he is in the wrong. The wife's actions were more wrong, but the husband's reaction is being questioned. If the user thinks the husband is in the wrong, they might argue that he should have handled it better. But others might say the wife's actions were worse. I think the husband's anger is a natural reaction to a serious breach of trust and health, so he's not entirely wrong. But maybe the answer hinges on whether yelling was the appropriate response. Since the action was a violation, his anger is justified, so he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
