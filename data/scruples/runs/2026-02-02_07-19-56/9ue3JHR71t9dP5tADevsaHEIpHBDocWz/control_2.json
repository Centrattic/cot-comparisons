More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Later, he had severe diarrhea and found out she had added too much laxative to his protein shake without his consent. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's wondering if he overreacted.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the husband's reaction was justified. The key points to consider are:\n\n1. **Consent and Autonomy**: The wife made a decision to administer a medication (laxative) without his knowledge or consent. This is a significant issue because no one should take control of another person's health without their agreement. It's a violation of personal autonomy.\n\n2. **Intent and Motivation**: The wife's intention was to help, but the method was wrong. Even with good intentions, acting without consent is problematic. However, her motivation might be considered in terms of whether it was a genuine attempt to help rather than malicious intent.\n\n3. **Author's Reaction**: The husband got angry and yelled. Anger in such situations is understandable given the violation of trust and health risk. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction if communication could have been handled more calmly. But considering the severity of the situation (severe diarrhea which can be dangerous), his reaction might be justified.\n\n4. **Consequences**: The laxative caused severe symptoms, which could have been harmful. The wife's action put her husband's health at risk without his knowledge. This is a serious matter.\n\n5. **Communication**: The husband did inform his wife about his constipation, which she used to justify her actions. However, that doesn't negate the need for consent. Proper communication would involve discussing the issue and finding a solution together, not acting unilaterally.\n\n6. **Cultural/Normative Context**: In many societies, making decisions about another person's health without their input is considered wrong. It's important to respect each other's autonomy in such matters.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the husband's anger is a response to a breach of trust and a health risk. While yelling isn't ideal, the act of secretly administering a medication without consent is a serious issue. The wife's actions, though well-intentioned, crossed a line. Therefore, the husband's reaction, while perhaps emotionally charged, is a valid response to an inappropriate action. The key here is that the wife's actions were wrong, and the husband is not in the wrong for being upset about it.\n"
