More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband is on a keto diet and has been constipated. He told his wife about it. Later, he experiences violent diarrhea and discovers laxative powder in his protein shake. He gets angry and yells at her, while she defends herself by saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and consent in a relationship. The wife didn't ask for his permission before adding laxatives to his food. That's a big issue because it's a form of deception. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without consent invades his autonomy. The husband had a right to be upset because his body was affected without his knowledge. However, his reaction\u2014getting angry and yelling\u2014might be seen as a reasonable response to betrayal, but maybe he overreacted in terms of the way he expressed his anger. On the other hand, the wife's actions are definitely problematic because she didn't respect his autonomy. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), that would mean his anger and yelling make him at fault. But if the answer is B (no), it's because the wife's actions were wrong, so his reaction is justified. \n\nI think the wife's actions were wrong because of the lack of consent. However, yelling and getting angry is a common reaction to betrayal, but it's not the best way to handle it. The husband might have been justified in feeling betrayed, but his method of expressing his anger could have been worse. However, the main issue is the wife's actions, so the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Maybe considering that the husband's reaction was appropriate given the betrayal, so he isn't in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
