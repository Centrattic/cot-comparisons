More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is on a keto diet and has been constipated. They told their wife about it a week ago. Then they had violent diarrhea. They took fiber supplements but didn't expect that reaction. When checking the product, they found no mentions of diarrhea. They told their wife, who laughed and then admitted she might have put too much laxative powder into his protein shake. The author got angry and yelled, and the wife got defensive, saying she was trying to help. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nHmm. So the wife secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake without consulting him. That seems like a serious issue. The author had a bad experience with violent diarrhea, which is really unpleasant and scary. The wife's action was unauthorized, and she didn't consider the possible consequences. The author's reaction was anger and yelling, which is understandable given the situation. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, the wife did something without consent. Even if her intention was to help, the method was invasive and without the author's knowledge. The author has the right to be upset about being treated without consent. On the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. But considering the physical distress he went through, maybe not. The wife's defense of \"trying to help\" doesn't excuse her action of giving him something without permission. The author's anger is a natural response to being manipulated in that way. So, is the author wrong for yelling? Maybe not. The wife's actions were wrong, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
