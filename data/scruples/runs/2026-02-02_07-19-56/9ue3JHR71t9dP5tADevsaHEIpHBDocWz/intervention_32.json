More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (AITA: Am I the Asshole?) is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. Then he had violent diarrhea after taking fiber supplements. He checked the product online but found no warnings. When he confronted his wife, she admitted to adding too much laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband got angry and yelled, but the wife said she was trying to help. The user thinks the author is at fault but wants to know my take.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong here? Let's consider both sides. The wife did something without his consent, which is a big deal. Manipulating someone's food or supplements without their knowledge is a clear boundary violation. That's a serious issue because it can lead to health risks. The husband had the right to know what was being put into his system, especially since he was already on a diet and dealing with health issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was yelling and getting angry. While his anger is understandable given the situation, reacting with yelling might be seen as over the top, especially if the wife was trying to help. But the initial act of the wife was the problem. She acted without permission, which is a significant breach of trust. \n\nThe key points here are consent and health safety. The wife's actions were non-consensual and could have caused harm. The husband's anger is a response to that violation, which is a valid reaction. However, yelling might be an unhealthy way to handle it. But the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since the wife's action was the initial wrongdoing, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. However, his reaction could be seen as excessive, depending on context. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whose actions were more in the wrong. The wife's action was a clear breach, so the husband's anger is justified. The husband isn't in the wrong for being angry because the wife acted without his consent. The main issue is her actions, not his reaction. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the husband not being in the wrong, even if his reaction could be improved. But sometimes AITA responses consider the emotional response as well. However, the core issue is the wife's secret action. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
