More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, the wife added laxative powder to his protein shake without his knowledge. The author didn't know about this and ended up experiencing violent diarrhea, which he later discovered might be due to the laxative. He confronts his wife, who laughs and then admits she might have put too much. The author reacts by getting angry and yelling, and she gets defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nNow, considering the situation: the wife acted without consent, altering his food/drink without his knowledge. That's a serious breach of trust and autonomy. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without consent can lead to harmful consequences. The author's reaction is understandable because his body was affected, and his trust was violated. However, yelling and getting angry might be seen as an overreaction depending on the context of their relationship and communication style.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions were indeed problematic. She made a decision that directly impacted her husband's health without his permission. The fact that she laughed and then admitted to it could make the author feel disrespected or dismissed, which might justify his anger.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife did something wrong, then the author's anger is a response to her actions. However, the way he reacted\u2014yelling and getting angry\u2014might not be justified if there's a history of poor communication or if there's a way to address issues calmly. The key points here are consent and the method of conflict resolution.\n\nIn many relationships, discussing health-related issues without consent is a big no-no. The wife's action was ethically wrong regardless of her intent. The author's anger stems from being manipulated and possibly feeling that his health was endangered. However, responding with yelling could escalate the conflict. The appropriate response might be to express distress and discuss boundaries, but yelling is a common reaction when someone feels betrayed.\n\nSo, considering the wife's actions were the root cause, the author's anger is a reaction to her wrongdoing. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on whether his reaction is justified, then maybe he isn't in the wrong because her action was wrong. However, if the focus is on his reaction being too harsh, then he might be in the wrong. But given that the wife acted without consent, the author's anger is understandable, so the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's more nuance.\n"
