More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, I need to recap the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and has been constipated. He told his wife about this. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but didn't find any mentions of diarrhea. When he told his wife, she laughed and then admitted she might have put too much laxative powder in his shake. He got angry and yelled. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the wife did something without his consent. Administering laxatives without permission is a big deal. It's a form of deception because she didn't ask him first. Even if her intention was to help, he has the right to make decisions about his own body. But the husband did mention his constipation issue to her, so maybe she thought she was helping. However, the method was wrong. \n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and yelling. Is that overreacting? Well, he was in a lot of pain and then found out his wife did this without asking. People might react strongly in that situation. But is it justified? He could have had a medical reaction, and she didn't consult him. So his anger might be understandable, but yelling and being confrontational could have been handled better. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife was the one who acted without consent, which is a problem. The husband's anger is a reaction to her unauthorized action. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, yelling and getting angry might be seen as an overreaction depending on the context. But given the circumstances, maybe not. \n\nAlternatively, the wife's actions were wrong, and the husband's anger is a valid response to her betrayal of trust. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife did something without consent, he's justified in being upset. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). \n\nBut some might argue that he should have been more understanding of her intentions, even if the method was wrong. However, the line between helping and violating autonomy is important. So I think the author isn't in the wrong here because the wife acted without permission, and the husband's reaction, while intense, is understandable given the violation.\n"
