More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for giving him laxatives without his consent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and was experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it, and later had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements he was taking and found no warnings about diarrhea. Then he confronted his wife, and she admitted to adding laxative powder to his protein shake, possibly too much.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife secretly added laxatives to his shake without his knowledge. The husband then had a severe reaction, which led to him getting angry and yelling. The question is whether he's at fault for his reaction.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, giving someone a medication or supplement without their consent is a big deal. Even if the intention was good (trying to help with constipation), it's a violation of autonomy and trust. The husband was clearly upset because he wasn't in control of what he was consuming, which led to a negative experience. His anger could be justified because his wife acted without his permission, which can be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, maybe some might argue that the husband overreacted because the wife's intention was to help, but the severity of the diarrhea and the shock of discovering it without consent might make his reaction understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling is a form of losing control, which could be seen as an overreaction regardless of the situation. But considering the context of being physically affected without consent, it's a complex situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife definitely acted inappropriately by adding laxatives without his knowledge. The husband's anger is a natural response to being deceived and physically harmed, even if his reaction (yelling) was not ideal. So, he's not entirely in the wrong because he had a reason to be upset. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
