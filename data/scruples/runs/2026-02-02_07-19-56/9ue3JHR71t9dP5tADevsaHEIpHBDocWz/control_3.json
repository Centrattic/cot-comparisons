More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives while he's on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and has been dealing with constipation. He mentioned this to his wife, who then secretly put laxative powder into his protein shake. This caused him to have violent diarrhea, which was unpleasant. When he found out, he yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo the main points here are: The wife acted without the husband's consent, which is a key issue. Even if her intention was to help, doing something without permission can be problematic. The husband had a negative reaction, both physically and emotionally, and his anger is a response to being manipulated without his knowledge.\n\nNow, considering if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The question is whether his anger and yelling were justified. From a typical perspective, people value autonomy and consent. The wife's action was a breach of trust because she didn't ask him. Even though her motivation was good, the method was questionable. The husband's reaction could be seen as understandable because he was harmed by her action, and he had the right to be upset about being deceived. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance where he could have handled it calmly. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The wife's actions were unethical and possibly harmful, so his anger is a valid reaction. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
