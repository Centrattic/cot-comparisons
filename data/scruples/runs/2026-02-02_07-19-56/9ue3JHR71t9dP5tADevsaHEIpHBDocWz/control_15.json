More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives. \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is on a keto diet and had been experiencing constipation. He mentioned this to his wife. Later, he had violent diarrhea and found out his wife had put too much laxative powder into his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she was defensive, saying she was trying to help. The question is whether he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the wife took it upon herself to add laxatives without his consent. That's a big deal because it's a health issue. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without permission can be seen as violating trust. The husband's reaction is anger and yelling, which might be strong, but the act of someone secretly altering his food or supplements could cause legitimate distress. \n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? Well, yelling is a form of reacting, but it's not necessarily justified just because the wife did something. The key points are consent and the wife's actions. If she didn't ask him and just decided to do it, that's a problem. However, maybe she thought she was helping. The husband's right to autonomy is important here. People might argue that his reaction is understandable because it's his body and he wasn't consulted. Others might say he overreacted because she was trying to help, even if it was a mistake. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife did something without his knowledge, he's not in the wrong for being upset. However, yelling could be seen as an excessive response. But given the health implications and the fact that someone is messing with his food, it's a valid concern. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because his wife acted without consent, and his reaction, while strong, is a response to her unauthorized action. The fact that she laughed and was dismissive might also contribute to his anger. So, B makes sense here.\n"
