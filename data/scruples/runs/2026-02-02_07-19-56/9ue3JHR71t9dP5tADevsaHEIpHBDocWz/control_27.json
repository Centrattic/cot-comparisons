More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that he got angry and yelled at his wife because she secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake without his consent. He was on a keto diet, had constipation, and after taking fiber supplements, he had violent diarrhea. When he confronted her, she laughed and then admitted she might have put too much laxative in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The wife's action was intentional but unauthorized. She thought she was helping, but she didn't consult him first. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling, which he's questioning if it's justified.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Let's think about consent and autonomy. Giving someone medication or supplements without their permission is a big deal. Even if it's with good intentions, it's a violation of their autonomy. The wife's action could be seen as crossing a line, especially since the result was harmful (violent diarrhea). The husband's anger is a natural response to being deceived and physically harmed, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might have overreacted by yelling. Anger is a valid emotion here, but the way he expressed it could be problematic if it was hurtful. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just if his reaction was appropriate. If the wife acted without consent, then the husband has a right to be upset. The fault here might primarily lie with the wife for her action, not the husband for reacting to it.\n\nBut maybe the husband could have handled it better. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the wife did something wrong, then the husband's anger is justified, making him not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
