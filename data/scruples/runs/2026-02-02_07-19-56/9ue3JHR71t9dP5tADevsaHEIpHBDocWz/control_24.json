More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe husband was on a keto diet and having constipation issues. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but didn't find any warnings. When he confronted his wife, she admitted to putting too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife did something without his consent, which could be seen as a violation of trust. Introducing a substance into someone's food or drink without their knowledge is generally considered a serious issue because it can lead to health risks. Even if her intention was to help, the method was secretive and potentially harmful.\n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and yelling. While his reaction might be strong, it's understandable given that someone tampered with his food without permission, leading to a severe physical reaction. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction if the wife's intention was genuinely to help, but the secrecy and potential health risks are significant factors.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife's action was definitely a problem. She didn't consult him about using laxatives, which could have had unintended side effects. The husband has the right to be upset about being given something without his consent. However, his response of yelling might not be appropriate, but considering the situation, it's a reaction to a breach of trust and a health scare.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Probably not. The main wrongdoer here is the wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The husband's anger is a reaction to her actions, not the cause of the problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
