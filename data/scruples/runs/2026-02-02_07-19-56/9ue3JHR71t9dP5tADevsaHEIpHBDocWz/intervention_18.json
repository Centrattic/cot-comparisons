More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband who got angry because his wife secretly gave him laxatives. They were on a keto diet, and the husband was having constipation issues. He told his wife about it, and she added laxative powder to his protein shake without telling him. When he had a bad reaction, he got angry and yelled at her.\n\nFirst, the wife did something without his consent. That's a big issue. People generally have the right to know what's going into their body, especially something like laxatives. Even with good intentions, it's a violation of autonomy. So the wife definitely made a mistake here.\n\nBut the question is about the husband's reaction. He got angry and yelled. Is that justified? Well, being in a situation where someone is given medication without their knowledge can be really upsetting. He was in a lot of discomfort, which adds to the stress. His reaction might be seen as a natural response to betrayal and the physical pain he experienced. However, yelling and getting angry isn't the healthiest way to handle the situation. Maybe he could have expressed his anger without yelling, but the content of his anger is about the wife's actions, not the reaction itself.\n\nThe wife's defense was that she was trying to help. But even with good intentions, acting without consent is wrong. The husband's right to make his own medical decisions is important. So while the wife is definitely at fault, the husband's anger is a response to her actions. The key here is whether the husband's response was over the top. Getting angry in this context is understandable, but yelling and getting into a defensive argument might not be the best approach. However, given the circumstances, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The main question is whether he overreacted. The wife's actions were unethical and possibly harmful, so the husband's anger is a justified reaction. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
