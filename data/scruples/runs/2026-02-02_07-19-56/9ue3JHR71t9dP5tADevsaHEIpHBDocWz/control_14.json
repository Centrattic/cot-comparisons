More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's on a keto diet and has been constipated. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea after taking fiber supplements. He checked the product online and found no warnings about that. Then he confronted his wife, and she admitted she might have put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife secretly added laxatives without his consent. That's a big deal because people have a right to know what's in their food, especially if it's a medical issue. The husband was upset because he experienced severe symptoms, which can be really uncomfortable and distressing. His reaction of anger and yelling is understandable given the situation. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's action was a breach of trust and could have been harmful. Even if she thought she was helping, doing so without his permission is a violation. The husband's anger might be seen as a justified reaction to being deceived and experiencing physical harm. However, yelling might be considered an overreaction even if the situation warranted emotional response. \n\nBut in this case, the wife's action was the root cause. She took initiative without his knowledge, which could have been dangerous. So the husband's anger is in response to her actions. While yelling isn't the healthiest way to handle it, the core issue is her unauthorized intervention. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. The problem is more on the wife's side for not getting his consent. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
