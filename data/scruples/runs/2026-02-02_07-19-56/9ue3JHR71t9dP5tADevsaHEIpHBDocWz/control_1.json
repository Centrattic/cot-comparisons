More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. Later, he has violent diarrhea and finds out his wife added too much laxative powder to his protein shake without telling him.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and intent. The wife's action was meant to help, but she did it without his knowledge. The husband felt betrayed and got angry as a result. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. Yelling is a strong reaction. But the wife's action was unauthorized. The husband has the right to be upset about someone messing with his food without permission, even if it was with good intentions. However, the husband's reaction (yelling) might be excessive, but the initial act of the wife was definitely wrong. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he has the right to be angry about being given something without his consent. The wife's action was a violation, so the husband's anger is justified, even if the way he expressed it could be improved. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
