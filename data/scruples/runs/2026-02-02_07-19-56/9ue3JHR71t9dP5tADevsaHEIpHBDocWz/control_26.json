More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for yelling at their wife for secretly giving them laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and was experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Later, he had violent diarrhea and found out his wife had put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's asking if he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife acted without his consent, using laxatives without his knowledge. That's a serious issue because she's making a medical decision for him without his input. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without consent is a problem. \n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and yelling. Is this justified? Well, having your spouse tamper with your food to administer medication without your knowledge is a significant breach of trust. It's not just about the laxatives causing discomfort; it's about the lack of communication and consent. His anger could stem from feeling violated or worried about the health implications of being given something without his knowledge. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might have thought she was helping, but that doesn't excuse her actions. The husband has the right to control what goes into his body. The fact that she laughed at his reaction might have added to his frustration, making him feel disrespected or not taken seriously.\n\nHowever, the husband's response was yelling. While the wife's action was wrong, yelling might not be the best way to address it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether his reaction is the most appropriate. The focus is on whether he was justified in being angry. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the wife's actions were a violation of his autonomy. The husband's anger is a reasonable emotional response to being manipulated in this way. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for feeling that way. The answer would be B (No) because the wife's actions were wrong, and his anger is a justified reaction, even if yelling wasn't the best approach.\n"
