More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives. \n\nFirst, the situation: the husband was on a keto diet and had constipation issues. He told his wife about it. The wife, without consulting him, added laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband ended up with violent diarrhea and got angry when he found out.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong for yelling? Let's consider the key points. The wife acted without his consent, which is a big deal. Medications or supplements, even for health reasons, should be taken with the person's knowledge and agreement. The wife's action was a violation of his autonomy. The husband had a valid reason to be upset\u2014his health was affected, and he felt betrayed. Yelling is an emotional reaction, but whether it's justified depends on the context. The wife's intent was to help, but her method was wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband could have handled it without yelling. But anger is a natural response when someone manipulates your health without consent. The wife's defense that she was trying to help doesn't excuse the lack of communication. The author isn't in the wrong because he had the right to be angry about being drugged without his knowledge. The answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
