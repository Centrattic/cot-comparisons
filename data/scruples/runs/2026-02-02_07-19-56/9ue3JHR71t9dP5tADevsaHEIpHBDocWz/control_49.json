More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after discovering she gave him laxatives secretly.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. The wife, without his knowledge, added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband then suffered violent diarrhea, which was very unpleasant. He got angry, yelled at her, and now he's wondering if he overreacted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the wife act in a way that justifies the husband's anger? And is the husband's reaction (yelling) appropriate?\n\nThe wife's action was to secretly add laxatives. Even though her intention was to help, doing so without consent is a problem. She didn't consult him or get his permission first. That's a breach of trust. However, she might have thought she was helping, but the method was wrong.\n\nThe husband was in physical distress because of her action. The experience of violent diarrhea is not something to be taken lightly. His anger and frustration are understandable. But the way he responded\u2014yelling\u2014could be seen as a valid reaction to being betrayed and physically harmed, even if it was well-intentioned.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, but given the context, it's a reaction to being manipulated without consent. The wife's actions were deceptive and potentially harmful. The husband has a right to be upset. However, yelling might have been an overreaction if there was a better way to express his feelings without escalating the situation. But given the severity of the physical reaction he experienced, his anger is justified.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the wife's actions were the main issue. She acted without consent, which is a violation of autonomy. The husband's reaction, while intense, is a response to that violation. So, in this scenario, the author (the husband) isn't in the wrong. The blame lies more with the wife for her actions. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
