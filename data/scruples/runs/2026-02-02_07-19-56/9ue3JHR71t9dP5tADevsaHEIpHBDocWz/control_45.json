More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the context: he's on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. She then secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake. He ended up with violent diarrhea, got upset, and yelled at her when she laughed and confessed. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the wife tried to help without consulting him. Maybe she thought she was doing the right thing. But adding something to his food without his knowledge is a big deal. It's a violation of his autonomy and trust. He had a legitimate reason to be upset because she acted without his consent, leading to a bad experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the man reacted with anger and yelling. His reaction was intense, but was it justified? He was physically harmed, even if unintentionally. The wife's action, while well-intentioned, was reckless. The husband's anger comes from being manipulated and feeling betrayed, which is understandable.\n\nBut is yelling the right response? Maybe he overreacted in the way he expressed his anger, but the underlying issue is serious. The wife's action is a red flag regardless of his reaction. The question is about whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Since he was the one who was harmed and the wife acted without consent, he's not in the wrong for being angry. The answer is B.\n"
