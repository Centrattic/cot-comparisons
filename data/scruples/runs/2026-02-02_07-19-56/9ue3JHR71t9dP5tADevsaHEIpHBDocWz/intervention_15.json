More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The scenario is that the husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it, then had severe diarrhea. Upon checking, he found laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and now the question is whether he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he went through something very unpleasant, unexpected, and potentially harmful. His wife didn't consult him before adding laxatives, which could be seen as a violation of trust and autonomy. Meddling with someone's food or supplements without consent is a big no-no. So he's justified in feeling upset about that.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's intention was to help, even if her method was wrong. But intentions don't always excuse actions. She took it upon herself to alter his drink without asking, which could have serious consequences. If the laxative dosage was excessive, it could have led to health issues beyond just diarrhea. The husband's anger might stem from both betrayal and the physical distress he experienced.\n\nNow, the key points: Did he overreact? Yelling is a strong reaction, but given the context\u2014physical harm, lack of consent\u2014it's not entirely unreasonable. However, yelling might have escalated the situation. The right approach would be to express his frustration calmly, discuss boundaries, and address the issue without aggression. So while his anger is understandable, the way he expressed it (yelling) might be considered over the top, especially since the wife was defensive and trying to explain her actions as helpful.\n\nBut the core issue is the wife's action. Secretly adding medication to someone's food is a serious breach of trust. The husband has the right to be upset. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction if the wife's intent was genuinely to help, though the method was wrong. Alternatively, if the laxative caused harm, his anger is justified. The line here is between a justified reaction to the action versus the expression of that reaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife made a poor decision, but the husband's response (yelling) might have been an overreaction. So while the wife is primarily at fault for her actions, the husband isn't entirely without fault in his response. However, the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes, he's in the wrong), that would mean his yelling is unjustified. If B (no), then it's understandable given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering that the wife's action was wrong, but the husband's response was yelling, which could be seen as disproportionate, there's a balance. Some might argue the husband's reaction is a justified expression of his anger towards her unauthorized action. Others might think he should have handled it more calmly. But in situations where someone's actions lead to someone else's physical harm and loss of autonomy, strong emotional reactions are expected.\n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe both are at fault. But the question is specifically about the author. If the answer is A, then he's wrong for yelling. If B, he's not. Given that the wife's action was wrong, and the husband's reaction, while perhaps not the best, is a response to that wrongdoing, maybe B is correct. But if the yelling was excessive, then A. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, in the context of the story, he was in a lot of pain and discovered that his wife intentionally added something without consent. His anger is directed at her for that. So even though yelling isn't ideal, he's not necessarily in the wrong because the action she took was wrong. Therefore, B.\n"
