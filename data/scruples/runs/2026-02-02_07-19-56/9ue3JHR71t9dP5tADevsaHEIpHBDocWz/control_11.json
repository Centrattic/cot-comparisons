More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the context: He's on a keto diet and dealing with constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he experienced violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements he was taking but found no warnings about diarrhea. When he confronted his wife, she admitted she might have put too much laxative powder in his protein shake, thinking she was helping him. He got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the wife did something without his consent. Even if her intention was good\u2014trying to help with constipation\u2014adding laxative powder to his shake without telling him was a violation of his autonomy. People generally expect that their bodies and what they consume are their own choice. Secretly altering someone's food or drink, even with good intentions, can be seen as a serious breach of trust. The husband has a right to be upset about that. His anger might be strong, but the act of secretly giving someone something without their knowledge is a big deal, especially when it's a medication or supplement. The consequences were severe, causing him physical distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was yelling and getting angry. While his wife's action was wrong, his response might have been disproportionate. Anger is a natural reaction, but yelling could be seen as aggressive. However, given the situation\u2014his wife meddled with his health without consent\u2014the anger is understandable. The key here is that the wife's action was the root of the problem. \n\nAnother angle: Was the wife's action reckless? Laxatives can have side effects, and giving too much could be dangerous. If she didn't consult him or a healthcare professional, that's a problem. He trusted her, and her action led to his suffering. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people usually expect that they control what goes into their bodies. The wife overstepped her boundaries here. The husband's anger is a response to a breach of trust and autonomy. Even if he could have handled it calmly, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he had a legitimate reason to be upset, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
