More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a husband getting angry because his wife secretly gave him laxatives. He was on a keto diet and had constipation issues. He told his wife about it, and she decided to add laxative powder to his protein shake without his consent. When he ended up with violent diarrhea, he got angry and yelled at her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the wife did something without asking. That's a big no-no. People generally don't like it when others make decisions about their health without permission. Even if her intention was to help, the method was wrong. So the wife definitely made a mistake here.\n\nNow, the husband's reaction: he got angry and yelled. Emotionally, that's understandable. He was in a lot of discomfort, and the fact that his spouse did this without telling him could lead to frustration. But is yelling the right response? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he has the right to be upset about being manipulated about his health. On the other hand, yelling could be seen as overreacting if he didn't give her a chance to explain or if he was aggressive.\n\nBut wait, the wife was defensive and said she was trying to help. So maybe there's a communication issue here. The husband's anger might stem from feeling betrayed. The fact that she laughed at his reaction adds insult to injury. However, yelling in anger is a common reaction to betrayal or violation of trust. So while the husband's reaction isn't ideal, maybe it's not entirely his fault.\n\nThe user said they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The wife's actions were wrong, but the husband's response could be seen as a justified reaction to being drugged without his knowledge. So is he overreacting? Maybe not entirely. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife was at fault, then the husband isn't in the wrong for being angry. However, yelling might not be the most constructive way to handle it. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B, not in the wrong.\n"
