More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but found no warnings. He confronted his wife, who admitted to adding too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled, and she got defensive, saying she was trying to help. The question is if the husband is overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife acted without his consent, which is a big issue. She's his spouse, but that doesn't mean she can make medical decisions for him. Secretly adding something to his food or drink is a breach of trust and autonomy. His reaction was anger and yelling, which the user is questioning if it's justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's intention was to help, which might mitigate some blame. But the method of secretly administering a laxative without his knowledge or consent is problematic. Medical decisions, even if well-intentioned, require consent. The husband has the right to know what's being put into his body, especially something that could have significant physical effects.\n\nThe husband's anger is a reaction to being deceived and potentially harmed. His wife's laughter and defensiveness might have escalated the situation. Yelling in the moment of anger is understandable, but perhaps he could have handled it more calmly. However, the core issue is the unauthorized action by his wife.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the wife's actions were wrong because she didn't get consent. The husband's reaction might be seen as a justified anger given the violation. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe some would argue that he overreacted, but the main issue is the wife's unauthorized action. So, B is the correct answer.\n"
