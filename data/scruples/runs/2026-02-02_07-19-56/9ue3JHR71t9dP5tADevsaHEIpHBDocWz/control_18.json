More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and had been constipated. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements he was taking but found no warnings about that. When he confronted his wife, she laughed and then admitted she put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help.\n\nSo the key points here are: the wife acted without his consent, secretly adding a substance (laxative) into his food. The husband found out, got angry, and yelled. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the wife's action is concerning. Deliberately adding a medication or supplement without the person's knowledge is a big deal. Even if it was with good intentions, it's a violation of trust and autonomy. People have the right to know what's in their food and to make their own decisions about their health. The wife might have thought she was helping, but her method was wrong. \n\nAs for the husband's reaction, getting angry and yelling might be a natural response to discovering someone has done something like that. However, yelling can be seen as an overreaction, especially if it's intense or hurtful. But considering the context\u2014his wife secretly altered his health regimen without his consent\u2014his anger is somewhat justified. The question is whether his reaction was proportionate. \n\nIn many cases, people might consider that while yelling isn't ideal, the underlying action (secretly adding a laxative) is worse. However, the husband could have handled it with more calmness to resolve the issue without escalating it. On the other hand, if he felt betrayed or that his health was compromised, his anger is understandable.\n\nThe wife's defense that she was trying to help doesn't absolve her of responsibility. Intentions matter, but actions have consequences. The husband's right to autonomy and informed consent is important here. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the wife's actions are definitely questionable. The husband's reaction, while perhaps not the most composed, is a response to her actions. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. Since he didn't do anything to warrant being yelled at, and his reaction is a result of her actions, the primary fault lies with the wife. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset, even if his method of expressing it could be criticized.\n"
