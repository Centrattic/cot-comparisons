More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. So the situation is that the husband was on a keto diet and was constipated. He told his wife about it, and then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but didn't find any warnings. When he confronted his wife, she admitted to putting too much laxative in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she said she was just trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether his reaction was justified. Let's break it down.\n\nThe wife did something without his consent. Administering laxatives without his knowledge is a big deal. Even if her intention was to help, doing it secretly crosses a line. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling. Is that overreacting?\n\nOn one hand, the wife's action was a violation of trust. She didn't ask him, which is a problem. She could have discussed her concerns and offered to help in a way that includes his consent. Her justification of \"trying to help\" doesn't negate the fact that she acted without permission.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's response was yelling. While understandable, yelling can be seen as an overreaction depending on the context. However, given that someone tampered with his food and caused him significant physical distress, his anger might be justified. People have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable, but the act of secretly adding medication (even if it's over-the-counter) without consent is a serious issue.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the potential harm caused. The wife's actions could have had unintended consequences, like causing severe diarrhea, which the husband experienced. Even if her intention was good, the method was wrong. The husband has the right to be upset about being manipulated without his knowledge.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. His reaction is a valid response to a breach of trust and unauthorized medical intervention. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
