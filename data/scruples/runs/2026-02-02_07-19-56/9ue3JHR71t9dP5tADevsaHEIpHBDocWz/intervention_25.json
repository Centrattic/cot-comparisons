More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was on a keto diet and had constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had severe diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but didn't see warnings. He confronts his wife, who laughs and then admits she added too much laxative powder to his shake.\n\nSo, the key points here: The wife acted without his consent, which is a big deal. She was trying to help, but doing so without his knowledge. The author was upset because of the physical discomfort and the deception. He yelled at her, and she got defensive.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, he had a legitimate reason to be upset. His wife gave him something without his consent, which led to a severe reaction. However, reacting with anger and yelling might be seen as over the top, even if his feelings are justified. \n\nBut wait, the wife's actions were invasive and could be considered harmful. She didn't consult him, and the result was a bad experience. The author's anger could be a reaction to both the physical discomfort and the breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, yelling is a strong reaction. Maybe he should have handled it calmly to discuss the issue instead of yelling. But the situation is pretty intense. The wife's actions were a serious privacy violation. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's reaction is justified. If the wife did something without consent that caused harm, then the author is not in the wrong for being upset. However, yelling might not be the best approach. But in terms of being \"in the wrong\" for his reaction, maybe there's a balance here. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think that even though the wife did something wrong, the author's response was too harsh. Alternatively, they might believe that both parties have some responsibility here. \n\nI need to consider the ethics of both sides. The wife's secret action was definitely a problem. The author's reaction, while possibly intense, is a response to being deceived and physically harmed. So, is yelling at her overreacting? It might depend on the context. If he's usually calm and this was an exception, maybe not. But if he's being aggressive, that's another issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, his method of expressing that anger (yelling) could be considered problematic. But the question is whether he's in the wrong overall. Since the wife did something wrong, the author's reaction, while perhaps not the best way to handle it, might not place the blame on him. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's actions were the primary issue. The author's anger is a reaction to her wrongdoing. However, the user might argue that he should have handled it differently, but technically, he's not in the wrong for being upset. But maybe there's a nuance where both are at fault. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. So they might be considering that the wife's actions were wrong, but the author's response was also wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife acted wrongly, then the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. So the answer is B.\n"
