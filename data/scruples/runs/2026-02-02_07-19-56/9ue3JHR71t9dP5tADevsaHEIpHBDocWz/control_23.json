More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experienced constipation. He told his wife about this. Then he had violent diarrhea after taking fiber supplements. He checked the product online but found no mention of that side effect. When he talked to his wife, she laughed and then admitted she had put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled, and she got defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife added laxatives without his knowledge. That's a big issue because it's a violation of trust and autonomy. She's making a medical decision for him without his consent. Even if her intention was to help, doing so secretly can be harmful. The husband had a severe reaction, which could have been dangerous. His anger and yelling are reactions to being deceived and potentially harmed. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, he did yell at her. Yelling can be a problem because it's aggressive and might escalate conflict. However, the context is important. He was in pain, felt betrayed, and discovered that his wife had secretly altered his food with medication. His reaction, while perhaps intense, might be understandable given the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, his wife's actions were questionable. She didn't consult him, didn't check the dosage, and potentially caused harm. Her defensive response (\"I was just trying to help\") doesn't mitigate the fact that she acted without his permission. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In AITA scenarios, the focus is on whose actions are more at fault. The wife's actions were the initial problem\u2014adding laxatives secretly. The husband's reaction was to her actions. While yelling isn't ideal, the wife's behavior is arguably more problematic. However, the husband could have handled it without yelling. But considering the situation, his anger is a response to her actions. \n\nIn many AITA cases, secret actions that affect someone else's health are seen as significant. So the wife's actions are a major issue. The husband's yelling is a reaction, but the primary wrongdoer is the wife. Therefore, the husband might not be in the wrong for reacting, even if his reaction was not perfectly measured. \n\nBut maybe the question is whether he's in the wrong for yelling. If so, then while his yelling is not ideal, the wife's actions are the root cause. So the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the wife's actions were more at fault.\n"
