More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at their wife for secretly giving them laxatives. The scenario is that the husband was on a keto diet and having constipation. He told his wife about it, then had violent diarrhea. Later, he found out his wife had added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's wondering if he overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife did something without his consent\u2014adding laxatives to his shake. That's a big deal because it's a health-related decision and involves medical intervention without his knowledge. Even if her intention was to help, doing it secretly could be seen as a breach of trust or autonomy. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling. Is that an overreaction? Well, being given something without consent, especially something that caused severe discomfort, might justify some level of anger. However, yelling and getting angry can be seen as aggressive, and perhaps he could have handled it with more calmness.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might have thought she was helping, but the method was wrong. She should have discussed it with him first. The husband's right to make decisions about his own body is important. The fact that the laxative caused violent diarrhea adds to the severity. The husband's anger is understandable because it's not just about a minor issue; it's about someone tampering with his health without permission.\n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's accurate. The key points: the wife acted without consent, the husband had a justified reason for anger. However, his response was yelling and getting angry. Is that appropriate? In some contexts, strong emotions are expected when someone interferes with your health. However, yelling can escalate the situation and might not be the best way to address it. But given the circumstances, is it unreasonable? Maybe not. People can have different thresholds, but in this case, the wife did something that directly affected his well-being without asking. The husband's anger is a reaction to being manipulated and experiencing physical harm. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he could have handled it better, but the question is about being in the wrong. If the wife is at fault for her actions, then the husband's reaction, while perhaps not ideal, isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. If the husband overreacted beyond what's reasonable, then he could be at fault. However, the situation is serious. So I think the answer is B.\n"
