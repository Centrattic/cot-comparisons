More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for giving him laxatives secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but didn't find any warnings. His wife admitted to adding laxative powder to his protein shake, thinking she was helping. He got angry and yelled at her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the wife act appropriately? Adding laxatives without consent is a problem. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without asking is a breach of autonomy. That's a big issue. The husband's reaction of anger and yelling\u2014was that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the wife did something without his permission, which could be seen as invasive and disrespectful. The husband's health was affected, leading to severe diarrhea, which is uncomfortable and could be a medical concern. His anger is a reaction to being manipulated without his knowledge, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband could have reacted more calmly. Yelling and getting angry might escalate the situation. However, the initial act of adding laxatives without consent is a major issue. The wife's defense that she was trying to help doesn't excuse the lack of communication. The husband's right to make decisions about his own body is important.\n\nSo, in terms of who's at fault: The wife definitely did something wrong by adding laxatives without his consent. The husband's anger is a reaction to that, so he's not entirely at fault. However, his response of yelling might be seen as overreacting if he didn't consider her intentions, even if misguided. But given the violation of his autonomy and the potential health risk, his anger is somewhat justified.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the wife was the one who acted without consent, and the husband's reaction, while perhaps intense, is understandable given the circumstances. The main issue is the wife's action, not the husband's anger.\n"
