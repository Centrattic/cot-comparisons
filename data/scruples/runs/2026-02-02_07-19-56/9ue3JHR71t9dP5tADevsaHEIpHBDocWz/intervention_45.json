More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the wife added laxative powder to his protein shake without his consent. He didn't know about it, and when he got severe diarrhea, he found out later from her. He got angry and yelled at her. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nThe key points are consent and intent. The wife did something without his knowledge, which caused him physical distress. Even if her intention was to help with constipation, doing it secretly is a problem. The author's reaction is understandable because he was harmed physically and his autonomy was violated. However, yelling and getting angry might be seen as an overreaction by some, but considering the situation, it's a valid response to being betrayed and physically affected.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions were wrong because she didn't ask for permission. The author has the right to be upset. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, which might be because they see the yelling as excessive. However, considering the violation of trust, the anger is justified. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
