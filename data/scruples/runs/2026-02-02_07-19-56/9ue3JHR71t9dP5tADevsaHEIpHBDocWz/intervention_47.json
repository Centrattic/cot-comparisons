More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a husband who got angry at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. He was on a keto diet and had constipation issues. He asked his wife about it, then later had violent diarrhea. When he checked the fiber supplement, he realized it wasn't the cause, and his wife admitted she added too much laxative to his protein shake.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants opinions. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the wife did something without his consent. She added laxatives without telling him. That's a serious issue because it's a medical intervention without his knowledge. She might have thought she was helping, but that's not an excuse. People have a right to know what's being put into their bodies, especially medications or supplements.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband reacted by yelling and getting angry. He might feel betrayed or violated. His reaction is understandable because of the health risk. Laxatives can be dangerous in high doses. So his anger is a valid response to a breach of trust and potential harm.\n\nBut was his reaction appropriate? Yelling and getting angry can escalate the situation. Maybe he should have tried to communicate calmly first. However, if someone secretly gives you something that could hurt you, even with good intentions, that's a big deal. So while his anger is justified, maybe the way he expressed it wasn't the best approach.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The key is whether his reaction was unreasonably harsh. The wife's action was a significant breach, so his anger isn't unwarranted. However, yelling could be seen as overreacting in the way he expressed his feelings. But considering the context, maybe his reaction is understandable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have communicated his anger in a calmer manner instead of yelling. So perhaps the author is partially at fault for his reaction, but the wife is primarily at fault for her secret action.\n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife did something wrong, and the husband's reaction is a natural consequence of that, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, yelling is a poor way to handle it. So there's a balance here. The answer depends on whether the reaction is proportionate to the action.\n\nIn many cases, people might say that while both parties have some responsibility, the wife's action was unethical and the husband's anger is justified but his yelling isn't the best approach. However, if the question is strictly whether the author is in the wrong, it's possible that he's not entirely wrong because he has a right to be upset. But maybe he is partially wrong for how he expressed it.\n\nBut the options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no). Given that the wife did something that could harm him without consent, his anger is understandable. However, yelling could be seen as overreacting. But the initial act by the wife is the main wrong here. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's justified in being angry about the unauthorized action, even if his expression of it was harsh.\n"
