More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for yelling at their wife after she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the wife did something without his consent. She added laxative powder to his protein shake, which led to violent diarrhea. The author was upset and angry about this. Now, the question is whether the author is overreacting or in the wrong for yelling.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, giving someone medication or supplements without their consent is a serious issue. It's a violation of their autonomy and can be seen as a form of manipulation. The wife's action, while possibly well-intentioned (trying to help with constipation), was done without asking and could have been harmful. The author had a legitimate reason to be upset\u2014his body reacted badly, and he was in pain. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction was yelling. Yelling can be seen as an overreaction depending on the context. The wife did it with good intentions, even if it was wrong. The author could have expressed his anger more calmly. But considering the violation of trust and the physical distress caused, his anger is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife should have discussed it with him first. Her action was the initial problem. The author's reaction might be justified because his body was affected without his choice. So, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the yell was proportionate. Since the wife's action was a serious breach of trust and caused harm, the author's anger isn't entirely misplaced. But yelling could have been handled better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The main wrongdoer here is the wife for not getting consent. The author's anger is a reaction to her action. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, even if his method of expressing it wasn't ideal. But does that make him wrong? The answer hinges on whether the yell is considered wrong. If the action (yelling) was wrong, then maybe the answer is A. But if the action was a justified reaction to her wrongdoing, then B. \n\nI think the wife is at fault for the initial wrongdoing, but the author's reaction might be seen as a justified expression of anger, even if it was yelling. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
