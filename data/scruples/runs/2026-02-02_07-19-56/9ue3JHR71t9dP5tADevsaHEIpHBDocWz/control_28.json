More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The scenario is that he's on a keto diet and experienced severe diarrhea after taking fiber supplements. He checked the product but found no warnings about that, so he confronted his wife, who laughed and then admitted she might have put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled, and she was defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wife secretly added laxative powder to his shake without his consent. The husband ended up with violent diarrhea, which was very uncomfortable and possibly distressing. He then yells at her, and she claims she was trying to help. The user is asking if the husband is overreacting, so the question is about whether his anger is justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are: unauthorized medication, the severity of the reaction (violent diarrhea), and the emotional response of anger and yelling. \n\nFrom a general perspective, giving someone a medication or supplement without their consent is a big deal. Even if the intention was to help, doing so without discussing it first can be seen as a violation of autonomy. The husband was clearly upset by the unexpected and severe reaction, which might be reasonable. However, the way he reacted (yelling) could be considered over the top, depending on the context. People often act out of anger when they feel betrayed or misled, which is a common reaction. But the question is not about the reaction's intensity per se, but whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIs the husband at fault for getting angry? Well, if the wife did something without his consent, leading to a health issue, his anger is a natural response. But maybe he overreacted by yelling. On the other hand, the wife's actions were invasive and could have had more serious consequences. The severity of the diarrhea suggests that the laxative amount was excessive, which might be a sign of negligence. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the wife is clearly in the wrong by administering something without permission. The husband's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to her unauthorized action causing him harm. However, yelling might not be the best way to handle it, but it's not necessarily making him the one at fault. The core issue is the wife's actions. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong. So, the answer hinges on whether his anger and yelling were justified given the circumstances. Since the wife did something that directly caused his health problem without his consent, the husband's anger is understandable. Yelling might be a poor reaction, but the situation is a breach of trust and potential harm, which can justify strong emotions. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset, even if his response could be improved. The wife is the one who acted unilaterally, so the author (husband) isn't in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
