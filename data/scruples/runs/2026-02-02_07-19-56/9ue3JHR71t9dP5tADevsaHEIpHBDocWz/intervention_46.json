More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband got angry and yelled at his wife after she secretly put laxative powder in his protein shake. The husband was on a keto diet and had been constipated, so he had mentioned it to his wife. She then added laxatives without telling him, leading to severe diarrhea. When he confronted her, she laughed and admitted to putting too much, which made him yell.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The key points here are consent, intent, and the reaction. The wife did something without his knowledge, which is a big deal because it's about his health. Even if her intention was good, not consulting him is a problem. On the other hand, the husband's reaction was yelling, which might be considered over the top. \n\nBut let's break it down. The wife's action was a violation of his autonomy. People have a right to know what's being put into their body, even if it's with good intentions. Her motivation was to help, but the method was wrong. She should have discussed it with him first. \n\nNow, the husband's reaction: he got angry and yelled. Anger is a normal response to being drugged without consent, but yelling might be seen as excessive. However, given that the situation could have serious health implications (like dehydration from violent diarrhea), his anger is somewhat justified. That said, yelling is a poor way to handle the situation. He should have tried to communicate calmly.\n\nSo, who is at fault more? The wife definitely did something wrong by acting without consent. The husband's reaction is problematic but perhaps less so. The question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If the user thinks he is in the wrong, then answer A. Otherwise, B.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the assistant needs to decide. In AITA scenarios, the balance is usually between intentional harm. The wife intended to help but violated his autonomy. The husband's reaction was a result of that violation. So, the primary fault is with the wife, but the husband's overreaction adds to it. However, the main issue here is the wife's actions. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because the wife's actions were the primary issue. But maybe the husband's yelling is also a problem. \n\nBut in AITA terms, the question is whether the husband is the asshole. If the wife acted without consent, even with good intentions, she's the one at fault. The husband's anger is a reaction to her action. So the husband isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
