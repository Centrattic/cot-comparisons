More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is on a keto diet and has been experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. Then he had violent diarrhea. He took fiber supplements but thought that might not be the cause. He checked the product online and found no mentions of diarrhea. Then he confronted his wife, who laughed, and she confessed to adding too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she was defensive. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The wife secretly gave him laxatives without his consent. That's a big issue. He found out and reacted by yelling. The question is whether he's in the wrong for getting angry and yelling.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the wife's action is definitely wrong. She took a medication without her husband's knowledge, which can have serious health consequences. That's a violation of trust and autonomy. However, the author's reaction is anger and yelling. Is that over the line?\n\nThe author's perspective: He was in a lot of discomfort from the diarrhea, which he initially thought was due to the fiber supplements. When he discovered his wife's secret action, he was upset. His anger might stem from a combination of physical pain, betrayal, and the fact that his wife acted without his consent. Yelling is an emotional response, but is it justified?\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Yelling can be seen as an aggressive response, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. However, is yelling inappropriate here? If someone does something harmful to you without consent, it's natural to be angry. But yelling might not be the best way to address it. The wife's action is the main issue here, but the author's reaction\u2014while perhaps understandable\u2014could be problematic if it's disproportionate.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife's act is clearly wrong. The author's anger is a reaction to that. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. Yelling is a reaction, but is the author at fault here? It depends on whether the response was reasonable. In some cases, yelling can be seen as inconsiderate or aggressive, but given the violation of trust and physical harm caused by the laxative, his anger could be justified.\n\nSo, if the wife is clearly in the wrong for her actions, then the author's anger might be a valid response. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry and yelling. However, maybe he could have handled it better without yelling. But the question is if he's in the wrong, not if there's a better way. The wife's actions are the main problem here.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author overreacted. But considering the context\u2014someone secretly giving him a medication that caused severe physical distress\u2014it's hard to say he's wrong for being upset. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
