More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for giving him laxatives without telling him. The situation is that he was on a keto diet and was constipated, so he mentioned it to his wife. She then secretly put too much laxative powder in his protein shake, leading to violent diarrhea. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife knew about his constipation and wanted to help, so she took matters into her own hands without his consent. That's a big issue because she didn't ask him. Even if her intention was good, she violated his autonomy. He had the right to make decisions about his own body and what he puts into it. Her actions were a form of medical decision-making without his knowledge, which is a serious breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction was anger and yelling. That's a valid emotional response when someone does something to you without permission, especially when it causes physical harm. But was he overreacting? Well, the wife's action was a serious privacy issue. People might react strongly to someone manipulating their food without consent. However, yelling and getting angry could have been handled differently. Maybe he could have expressed his anger without yelling, but the initial violation is on the wife's side.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife acted without consent, which is a big no-no. The author's anger is a reaction to that violation. So, is the author at fault for getting angry? In many cases, people might say that while yelling isn't ideal, the root cause is the wife's breach of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about something being done to him without permission. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The wife's actions are the main issue here.\n"
