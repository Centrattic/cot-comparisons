More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, the situation: the husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. The wife, without his knowledge, added laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband then had severe diarrhea, which led to him confronting her and yelling. The wife's defense was that she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the wife act inappropriately by adding laxatives without consent? If so, the husband's reaction might be justified. If not, maybe he overreacted.\n\nThe wife's action is a form of medical intervention without the husband's consent. Even if her intention was to help, administering medication without consent can be considered a violation of autonomy. People have the right to control what goes into their bodies. Even if she thought she was helping, she didn't ask, which is a problem. \n\nThen there's the husband's reaction. He got angry and yelled. Anger is a natural response when someone does something to you without consent, especially if it caused harm. However, yelling might be seen as an overreaction, depending on the context. But considering the situation\u2014someone messing with his health without asking\u2014it's understandable. \n\nThe wife laughed at his reaction, which adds to the frustration. Her defensiveness when confronted also doesn't help. But the main issue is her action. If she was wrong, then the husband's anger is justified. If she was right in her intent, maybe he overreacted. But the line between help and violation is crossed when consent is absent. \n\nSo, the husband is not in the wrong for being upset. The wife's action was the root cause, so the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). However, maybe the husband could have handled it better without yelling, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best way to handle it. If the wife's action was wrong, then his anger is justified.\n"
