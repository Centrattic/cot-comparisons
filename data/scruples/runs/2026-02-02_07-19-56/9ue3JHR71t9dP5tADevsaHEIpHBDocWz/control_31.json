More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The situation involves the husband on a keto diet experiencing constipation, the wife adding laxative powder to his protein shake without his knowledge, leading to severe diarrhea. He then gets angry when he finds out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of both sides. The wife's action of adding laxatives without his consent is a big issue. Even if her intention was to help with constipation, doing so without his knowledge or consent is a violation of his autonomy. People have the right to control what goes into their bodies, especially medications. That's a key point here.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction is anger and yelling. While his feelings are understandable given the unexpected and unpleasant experience, the question is whether his reaction is justified. The wife's actions were secretive and potentially harmful without his knowledge. However, the husband's response of yelling might be seen as excessive, but maybe it's a reaction to the violation of trust rather than the situation itself.\n\nBut the main issue is the wife's actions. She didn't ask, she overstepped, and that's a major breach of trust. The husband's anger is a reaction to her actions, not just the physical effects. The key here is the lack of consent. In relationships, even well-meaning actions without consent can be problematic. The husband isn't wrong for being upset because his autonomy was disregarded. The wife's defense that she was trying to help doesn't excuse the lack of communication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author (the husband) isn't in the wrong for being angry. The wrong here is more on the wife for her secretive actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
