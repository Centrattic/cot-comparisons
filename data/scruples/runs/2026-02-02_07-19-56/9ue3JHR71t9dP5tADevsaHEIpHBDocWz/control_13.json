More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. Then he gets violent diarrhea. He checks the fiber supplements but finds no warnings. He confronts his wife, who admits she added too much laxative to his protein shake. He yells at her, and she's defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nNow, the key points here. The wife did something without his consent\u2014adding laxatives to his shake. That's a big deal because it involves his health and autonomy. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without permission is a violation of trust and personal boundaries. The husband had a legitimate reason to be upset because the laxative caused severe effects, leading to distress. His anger is a reaction to the fact that someone manipulated his food/drink without his knowledge, which could be dangerous. \n\nIs he overreacting? Well, the situation involved unauthorized medical intervention, which can be dangerous. People have the right to control what goes into their bodies. The wife's action was a breach of that right, regardless of her intentions. The husband's reaction is understandable given the potential risks. However, yelling and getting angry is a common emotional response, but maybe he could have handled it calmly. But the core issue here is the wife's action, not the husband's anger. \n\nSo, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since he's reacting to his wife's unauthorized action, he's not in the wrong for being angry. The fault lies with the wife for her actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
