More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The situation is that the man was on a keto diet, experiencing constipation, and his wife added laxative powder to his protein shake without his knowledge. When he had a bad reaction, he got angry and yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he was trying to manage his health, told his wife about his constipation, and she decided to take matters into her own hands without consulting him. She added a laxative, which caused severe diarrhea. He felt betrayed and was in pain, so his anger is understandable. However, yelling and getting angry could be seen as an overreaction if he didn't communicate his feelings calmly.\n\nOn the wife's side, she claims she was trying to help. Maybe she didn't realize the laxative was too strong or that it could cause such a severe reaction. But giving someone a medication without their consent is a big issue. Even with good intentions, she crossed a boundary. She should have discussed possible solutions with him instead of acting unilaterally.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and communication. The wife's action of adding a laxative without his knowledge is a violation of his autonomy. Even if she meant well, the act of administering something without permission is problematic. The husband's reaction is justified because he was harmed physically and his trust was broken. However, his response of yelling might not be the best way to handle it. Anger is a natural reaction, but yelling can escalate the situation. So, while the husband is not in the wrong for being upset, his method of expressing that anger could be considered overreacting, but maybe not entirely his fault.\n\nWait, the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But maybe I need to weigh the actions. The wife's action was a serious privacy and health issue. The husband's anger stems from being manipulated without his consent. So, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. But when he got angry and yelled, he might have overreacted in terms of how he expressed his anger, even if the situation was bad. So perhaps the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the root issue is the wife's action, but the husband's response is understandable given the circumstances. Alternatively, if the yelling was disproportionate to the situation, then maybe A (Yes). But given the severe reaction from the laxative, the husband's anger is justified. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong because the wife's action was the main issue, and his anger is a reaction to being harmed without consent.\n"
