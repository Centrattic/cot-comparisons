More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but found no warnings. When he told his wife, she laughed and confessed she might have added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was trying to help. The user (AITA) is asking if he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here: the wife added laxative without his knowledge. The husband got upset because of the unexpected and unpleasant experience. The wife's action was meant to help but went too far. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling.\n\nNow, I need to assess who is in the wrong. The wife's action violates the husband's autonomy and trust. Secretly adding something to someone's food or drink is a serious privacy breach. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without consent is problematic. The husband's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to being betrayed in a personal way. However, yelling might be seen as excessive, but the context is that he was in a lot of physical discomfort and felt betrayed.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's defense that she was trying to help could be a mitigating factor. But the act of doing it without consent is a major issue. The husband has a right to control what goes into his body. The wife's action, while well-intentioned, was a breach of trust. The husband's anger is a legitimate response to that breach. However, yelling might have been an overreaction in terms of how he communicated his anger, even if the situation itself is understandable.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The wife did something wrong by secretly adding laxatives, which is the root cause. The husband's reaction is a result of that action. So, is the husband in the wrong for yelling? It depends on whether the response is proportionate. If the wife's action is clearly wrong, then the husband's anger is justified, but yelling could be seen as an overreaction. However, sometimes in moments of high stress and betrayal, people react strongly. The key is whether the husband's reaction is reasonable given the violation.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the wife is at fault for her actions. The husband's reaction is a consequence. However, the question is about the husband being in the wrong. If yelling is an acceptable expression of justified anger, then maybe not. But if the husband could have handled it more calmly, then maybe he's partially at fault. But the situation is that the wife's action was a serious breach, so the husband's anger is understandable. The problem is that the wife did something wrong without consent. The husband's yelling is a reaction, but does that make him wrong? Or is the wife the one in the wrong for her actions?\n\nI think the wife is in the wrong for adding the laxatives without permission. The husband's anger is a reaction to that. While yelling may not be the best way to handle it, the root problem is the wife's action. Therefore, the husband's anger is justified, and he's not in the wrong for feeling betrayed. So the answer would be B (No, author is not in the wrong).\n"
