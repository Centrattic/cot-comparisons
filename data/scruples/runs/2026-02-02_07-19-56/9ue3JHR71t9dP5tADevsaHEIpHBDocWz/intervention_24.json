More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The scenario involves the husband being on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it, then had violent diarrhea after taking fiber supplements. He checked the product online and found no warnings. When he confronts his wife, she admits to adding too much laxative powder to his protein shake, thinking she was helping. The husband got angry and yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's intention was to help, but she did it without his consent. That's a big issue because inserting something into someone's food or drink without permission is a violation of autonomy. However, the husband reacted with anger and yelling. Was his reaction justified?\n\nThe husband's anger is understandable because he was physically harmed and had no control over what was happening. His health and safety were compromised without his knowledge. On the other hand, his response was yelling, which can be seen as an overreaction, especially since the wife was trying to help, albeit inappropriately. However, the severity of the situation\u2014experiencing violent diarrhea due to an undisclosed substance\u2014might justify his emotional reaction. \n\nIn terms of fault, the wife definitely crossed a line by acting without consent. The husband's anger is a response to that breach. But does yelling make him wrong? It depends on how we view reactions to betrayal and harm. If the wife's actions were malicious, anger would be justified. But since she was trying to help, maybe the husband's response was too harsh. However, the key point is that she shouldn't have done it in the first place. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it would mean his yelling was unwarranted. If B (no), then his reaction is understandable given the violation. Considering that the wife acted without consent, the husband's anger is a reaction to being manipulated, which is a valid response. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong, even if his method of expressing anger was inappropriate. The real issue is the wife's actions.\n"
