More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had severe diarrhea and found out his wife added laxative powder to his protein shake without telling him. He got angry and yelled at her, and she was defensive, saying she was trying to help. The question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the wife's actions: she secretly added laxatives. That's a big deal because it's a health issue. People don't usually like having substances added to their food or drinks without consent, especially medications. Even if her intention was to help, doing it without discussion is a problem. It's a violation of trust and autonomy.\n\nThe husband's reaction: he got angry and yelled. Anger in such situations is understandable because of the deception. However, yelling might be seen as an overreaction depending on the context. But considering the situation\u2014his wife tampered with his health without his knowledge\u2014it's not entirely unreasonable. He had a severe physical reaction, which could be dangerous. \n\nThe key points are consent and health safety. The wife's action was a breach of trust, and the husband's anger is a reaction to that betrayal. While yelling isn't ideal, the underlying issue (unauthorized medication) is serious. The husband isn't in the wrong for being upset about his wife's secret action that endangered his health. The wife made the mistake, so the author (husband) is not in the wrong here.\n"
