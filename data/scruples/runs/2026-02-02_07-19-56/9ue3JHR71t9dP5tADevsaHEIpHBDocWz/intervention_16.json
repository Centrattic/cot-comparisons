More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is on the keto diet, which has been going well except for regular constipation. He mentioned this to his wife a week ago. Then he had violent diarrhea. He took fiber supplements but didn't expect that reaction. When he checked the product, there were no mentions of causing diarrhea. He confronted his wife, who laughed and then admitted she might have put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled, and she defended herself by saying she was just trying to help. The question is whether the author is overreacting or in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The wife tried to help by adding a laxative, but she did it secretly. That seems like a problem because it's a medical action without consent. The author was unaware and ended up in a lot of discomfort. Yelling is a strong reaction, but maybe he has a right to be upset because his wife made a decision that affected his health without his knowledge. On the other hand, the wife's intention was to help, which might mitigate some blame, but the method was wrong. \n\nHowever, the author's reaction is yelling, which is aggressive. Even if he's justified in being upset, yelling could be seen as overreacting. Maybe he should have addressed the situation calmly first. But the key point is that his wife did something without his permission, which is a significant breach of trust. \n\nThe author's anger might be valid because it's about his health and autonomy. People usually expect to have control over what they ingest, especially medications. The wife's action, while well-meaning, was a violation of that. So, the author's reaction, though intense, could be a response to that violation. \n\nBut I need to evaluate if yelling is an appropriate response. Some might say that even if the wife was wrong, the author shouldn't have yelled. Others might argue that in a situation where someone is made to feel unwell through deception, anger is understandable. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife's action was the main issue, then the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. However, his method of responding (yelling) might be considered overreacting, even if the cause is valid. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at both the problem and the reaction. The wife's secret action is a problem, but the author's yelling could be seen as the \"asshole\" move. But maybe the primary issue is the wife's actions, making the author not the asshole. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The wife did something wrong by not consulting him. The author's yelling is a strong reaction, but maybe he's justified given the circumstances. So, the answer might depend on whether the wife's actions are worse than the author's reaction. \n\nIn many cases, deceptive actions to help someone are considered problematic. The husband has the right to be upset, but yelling might not be the best approach. However, the initial act of giving laxative without consent is worse. So the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer could be B (No), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for overreacting, which would be A. \n\nI think the main issue is the wife's secret action. The author's reaction is a response to that, so he's not necessarily in the wrong. The appropriate action is to be upset, but the way he expressed it (yelling) might be the problem. However, the question is about being in the wrong in the situation, not just the reaction. \n\nSince the wife did something without permission, the author's anger is understandable. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
