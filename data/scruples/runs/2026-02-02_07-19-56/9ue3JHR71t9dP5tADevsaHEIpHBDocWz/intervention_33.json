More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this issue. A week later, he has violent diarrhea. He checks the fiber supplements but finds no warnings. Then he confronts his wife, who admits she added too much laxative powder to his protein shake.\n\nThe husband got angry and yelled at her, and the wife was defensive, saying she was trying to help. The user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. They want a choice between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nSo, why might the husband be in the wrong? Well, his wife did try to help, albeit without his consent. Introducing a substance into his food without permission is definitely wrong, but maybe the husband overreacted. Secretly adding laxatives is a form of non-consensual medical action, which is a big no-no. However, the wife's intention was to help, but her method was wrong. \n\nBut the husband's reaction was anger and yelling. Was that over the top? Maybe. He could have been upset that she didn't consult him, but yelling might have escalated the situation. On the other hand, being drugged without consent is a serious issue. However, the laxative was in his own protein shake, and it caused severe diarrhea. So there's a balance between his right to autonomy and her attempt to help. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The wife shouldn't have done it without asking, and the husband's reaction could have been more measured. But the question is specifically whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since he chose to yell and not communicate calmly, that's a valid issue. His anger is justified due to the unauthorized action, but his response might be excessive. \n\nHowever, depending on cultural norms, some might see his reaction as appropriate given the violation of autonomy. But usually, in such scenarios, the person who did the unauthorized act is at fault. The husband's yelling is a reaction to that, so maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. The key is whether his reaction was justified. If the wife's action was a breach of trust, then his anger is understandable, but yelling might be considered overreacting compared to calmly discussing it. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's reaction is proportionate. Since the wife did something without consent, the husband's anger is reasonable, but yelling could be seen as harsh. However, the wife's action is clearly wrong, so the husband isn't entirely in the wrong. Therefore, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, given that the wife acted without consent, the husband's anger is justified, so he's not in the wrong. So Answer: B.\n"
