More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband got angry and yelled at his wife for secretly putting laxatives in his protein shake. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The husband is on a keto diet and mentioned being constipated. The wife, without his knowledge, added laxative powder to his shake. He then experienced violent diarrhea, which he didn't expect from fiber supplements. He got angry and yelled at her, and she was defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife acted without consent, the husband was upset about the unexpected reaction, and he responded with anger and yelling. The user is suggesting the husband is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe wife's action: She put laxatives in his shake without asking. That's a violation of his autonomy and trust. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without his permission is a big deal. People have the right to know what's in their food and body. Secretly drugging someone is a serious issue regardless of intent.\n\nThe husband's reaction: He got angry and yelled. Is that justified? Well, being drugged without consent is a significant breach of trust. If he felt that his wife was manipulating his health without his knowledge, his anger might be a reaction to that violation. But does yelling make him the asshole? Maybe if the response was overly aggressive or if there's a history of such behavior. However, if this was a one-time incident where he felt betrayed, it's understandable. The problem is that yelling can be seen as an overreaction, especially if she was trying to help. But the act of secretly adding laxatives is still the main issue.\n\nSo, the wife's actions are a major problem. Even if she meant well, she didn't ask. The husband's reaction is in response to her actions. The question is whether he overreacted. The line between justified anger and overreaction can be thin. Yelling might be a valid reaction to betrayal, but it's also important to consider the context. If she had discussed it with him first, even if he had refused, that would be different. Since she didn't, her actions are more concerning. The husband's anger is a reaction to her decision to act behind his back. The community might look at the wife's secret action as the main problem, but the husband's yelling could be seen as overreacting if he didn't handle it calmly. However, given that she was laughing and defensive, maybe his anger was a result of her lack of concern. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on who did the wrong. The wife did the wrong by adding laxatives without consent. The husband's reaction is a consequence of her actions. While yelling isn't ideal, the primary wrongdoing is the wife's. The husband isn't in the wrong for being upset about it. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I think the wife's actions are the main problem here. The husband's anger is a response to being manipulated and not informed, which is understandable. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
