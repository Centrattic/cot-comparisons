More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nSo the situation is, the husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements and found no warnings about that. He confronted his wife, who admitted she put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled. The wife says she was trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions of both parties. The wife did something without his consent, which is a big issue. She added laxatives without his knowledge, which could be seen as a violation of trust. However, her intention was to help, but the method was wrong. The husband was in distress because of the unexpected and severe reaction, which is understandable. He got angry and yelled. \n\nThe question is whether he's overreacting. Anger in such a situation is normal because someone is manipulating his food without permission, leading to a painful experience. However, yelling could be seen as an inappropriate response, especially if it's aggressive. But given the context, maybe he's justified in being upset about the lack of consent and the harm caused.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's actions were harmful and invasive. She didn't consult him before adding laxatives, which is a red flag. The husband's reaction might be a valid expression of his frustration over being treated without consent. However, yelling might not be the best way to handle it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife's action was unethical and harmful, maybe the husband isn't wrong to be angry. But if he overreacted by yelling, that could be his fault. However, given that she did something so invasive, maybe his anger is justified. I'm a bit torn here. The key points are consent and the severity of the reaction. The husband didn't consent to having laxatives added to his food. The wife's action was a breach of trust. The husband's anger is a response to that breach. While yelling is not ideal, the root issue is the wife's unauthorized action. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong here. But I need to weigh the moral fault. The wife's action is clearly wrong, so the husband's reaction, while perhaps intense, is in response to her wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
