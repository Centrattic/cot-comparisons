More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The scenario is that the husband was on a keto diet and had constipation issues. He told his wife, and then had violent diarrhea. He found out she put too much laxative in his shake.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The wife acted without his consent, which is a big deal. Even if her intention was to help, doing something behind his back could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband had a bad physical reaction, which is understandable to be upset about. His anger might be because of the physical discomfort and the betrayal of trust. \n\nBut then, is his reaction justified? Yelling and getting angry might be a natural response when someone does something harmful without permission. However, the wife did say she was trying to help, so maybe the husband could have reacted in a calmer way to address the issue. But given that she acted without his knowledge, leading to a painful experience, his anger isn't entirely unfounded. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the physical harm caused. Since the wife didn't consult him and he ended up with severe diarrhea, her action was reckless. The husband's reaction could be seen as a response to both the physical suffering and the lack of respect for his autonomy. However, yelling might not be the best way to handle it, but it doesn't necessarily make him in the wrong. \n\nConsidering these factors, the wife's actions were the mistake. The husband's anger is a reaction to her actions, not the root of the problem. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
