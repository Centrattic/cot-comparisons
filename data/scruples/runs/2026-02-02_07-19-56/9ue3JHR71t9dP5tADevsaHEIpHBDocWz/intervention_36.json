More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The situation is that he was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it, and she secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake. He found out later, got angry, and yelled at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife's intention was to help him with his constipation, but without his consent. She took matters into her own hands, which could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the husband had already mentioned his issue with constipation, so maybe she thought she was helping in a way he wouldn't mind. However, giving someone medication or supplements without their knowledge is generally a big deal. It's a violation of autonomy and could lead to health risks, even if the intention was good.\n\nThe husband found out and reacted with anger. Is that justified? Well, he had the right to make decisions about his own body. His wife's action was a secret, which could be seen as manipulative. The husband was upset because he wasn't consulted, and the laxative caused severe diarrhea, which was unexpected. His anger might be a reaction to the lack of consent and the health scare.\n\nBut is the husband overreacting? Maybe he should have communicated better. However, the act of secretly adding something to his food is a serious issue. People might have different thresholds for what they consider a betrayal, but in most cases, this would be a breach of trust. The husband's anger could be seen as a reasonable response to being manipulated and risking his health.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have approached the situation calmer. Yelling might not have been the best reaction, but the act itself was wrong. The key points are the lack of consent and the health impact. The wife's actions were wrong, so the husband's anger isn't entirely unfounded. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But I need to check again. If the husband is in the wrong, maybe because he overreacted. But the initial act was by the wife. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
