More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea and discovered his wife added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's wondering if he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and trust. The wife, without the husband's knowledge, added a laxative to his shake. That's a big deal because it's a medical intervention without consent. Even if her intention was to help, it's a violation of autonomy. The husband had a legitimate reason to be upset because someone tampered with his food, leading to a severe and unpleasant reaction. \n\nHowever, the husband's reaction was to yell and get angry. While his anger is understandable given the situation, the question is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Yelling can be seen as an overreaction, especially if it's aggressive or hurtful. But considering the circumstances\u2014his wife secretly altered his food which caused significant discomfort\u2014his anger might be justified. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? The wife's actions were definitely wrong because she didn't seek permission. However, the husband's response of yelling might be seen as inconsiderate or harsh. The right approach would have been to express his anger calmly, maybe confront her without yelling. But if he felt betrayed and hurt, his emotional reaction is somewhat expected. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both parties. The wife made a poor decision, but the husband's reaction isn't necessarily the worst here. However, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because he overreacted. If B (no), then his reaction is understandable given the wife's actions. \n\nI think the husband's anger is a reaction to being manipulated and harmed without his consent. Yelling might be a bad way to handle it, but it's not entirely his fault. The wife's actions were more clearly in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
