More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband was on a keto diet and was having constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea, which he initially thought was from the fiber supplements he was taking. Later, he found out that his wife had secretly put too much laxative powder into his protein shake.\n\nHe got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was just trying to help. The question is whether he's overreacting. The options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's think about the wife's actions. She didn't ask for permission, just decided to add laxatives to his shake. That's a bit of a big deal because it's a health-related decision involving medication. Even if her intention was to help, doing it without discussion is a problem. People might have allergic reactions or other issues, and it's a matter of autonomy. So she's definitely at fault here.\n\nNow, the husband's reaction: he got angry and yelled. Is that justified? Well, she did something without his consent that could have had serious side effects. Violent diarrhea is uncomfortable and could lead to dehydration or other issues. He was in physical distress, and when he found out she was the cause, getting upset makes sense. Anger in response to being manipulated or having someone do something invasive without consent is a normal reaction. However, yelling might be seen as a harsh response. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe, but given the circumstances, his anger isn't entirely unwarranted.\n\nBut does that make him in the wrong? The question is about whether he's at fault. The main issue here is the wife's breach of trust and autonomy. The husband's anger is a reaction to that. While yelling might be an overreaction in terms of how he expressed his anger, the root cause is her actions. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because he had a legitimate reason to be upset. However, if someone overreacts in their expression, even if the underlying issue is valid, there could be criticism. But in the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the question is whether he's the asshole, which is about being disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nThe wife did something wrong, which is the main factor here. The husband's reaction is more about being angry at her for acting without consent. So the primary wrongdoing is hers. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for being angry. Answer B.\n"
