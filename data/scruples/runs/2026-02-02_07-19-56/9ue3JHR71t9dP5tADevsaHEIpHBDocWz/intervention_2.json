More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife secretly added laxatives to his protein shake, causing him to have violent diarrhea. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's wondering if he overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The wife knew about his constipation from the keto diet and tried to help by adding laxative powder to his shake. But she didn't consult him, which is a problem. The husband found out by himself after experiencing severe diarrhea, then confronted her and yelled. She was defensive, saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the wife's actions and the husband's reaction. The wife made a decision without his knowledge, which is a breach of trust. People have the right to know what's being added to their food or drinks, especially something that affects their health. Even if her intention was good, acting without consent is a red flag.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was to yell and get angry. While the wife's actions were wrong, his response might be excessive. Anger is a natural reaction, but yelling can escalate the situation and could be seen as overreacting, especially if he didn't address the issue calmly first. However, considering the wife's breach of trust, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong for being upset. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is. I need to consider if his yelling was justified. The wife's action was a serious privacy and trust violation. The husband had a right to be upset, but how he expressed it could be problematic. In relationships, communication is key. Instead of yelling, a calmer discussion might have been better. However, the initial act of adding laxatives without consent is the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the author (husband) is not in the wrong because the wife acted without permission, which is the primary issue. The husband's anger stems from being betrayed and tricked. While yelling isn't ideal, the context of the situation (severe health effects from an unauthorized action) might justify his strong reaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. However, I need to be cautious because sometimes in AITA situations, both sides have some fault. But in this case, the wife's actions were clearly wrong, and the husband's reaction, while intense, is a response to that. So the main wrongdoer is the wife, not the author.\n"
