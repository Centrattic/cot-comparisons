More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and was constipated. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but found no warnings about that. When he told his wife, she laughed and then admitted she put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled, and she defended herself by saying she was just trying to help.\n\nSo, what's the issue here? The key points are: the wife did something without his consent. Even if her intention was to help, administering something without permission can be a big deal. The husband felt betrayed or violated because she made a decision about his health without his input. The reaction was anger and yelling, which the author is questioning if he's overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects: consent is a major factor. When someone takes control of another person's health without their agreement, that's generally not acceptable. The wife's actions were invasive, even if well-intentioned. The husband's anger could be justified because his autonomy was compromised. However, his response was yelling, which might be seen as excessive depending on the context. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, which is a separate issue from whether his reaction is appropriate.\n\nThe wife's defense of \"trying to help\" doesn't negate the lack of consent. People can have good intentions but still cross boundaries. The husband has the right to be upset about his health being managed without his knowledge. So, in terms of right and wrong, the wife's action is the problematic one. The husband's anger is a reaction to her actions, so he's not in the wrong for being upset. However, the yelling might be a separate issue, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether his reaction is the best possible. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the wife acted without consent, and the husband has a right to be angry about that. The question is about fault, and the fault lies with the wife, not the husband.\n"
