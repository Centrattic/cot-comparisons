More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their wife after discovering she put laxatives in his protein shake. \n\nFirst, the context: The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. The wife, without consulting him, added laxative powder to his shake. The man ended up with severe diarrhea and got angry when he found out.\n\nSo, the key points here. The wife's action was unauthorized. She didn't ask him if she could do that, even though he was dealing with a medical issue. The laxatives could have serious side effects, especially without knowing the correct dosage. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling. \n\nNow, considering the situation, the wife's actions were underhanded. She didn't discuss it with him, which is a problem because it's his body and health they're talking about. Her intention was to help, but the method was secretive and potentially harmful. The husband's anger is understandable because he was harmed by her actions without his consent. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, yelling is a strong reaction. Maybe he could have handled it calmly. However, the situation was stressful\u2014he was in physical pain and discovered that his wife had done something without telling him. His anger isn't unwarranted. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife should have communicated her plan. Her defense that she was trying to help doesn't excuse the lack of consent. The husband's right to autonomy over his own body is violated here. \n\nIn terms of blame, the main fault lies with the wife for acting without consent. The husband's reaction is intense but might stem from valid reasons. So, the answer is probably that the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance where both could have handled it better. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife's action was the root cause, the answer is B (No).\n"
