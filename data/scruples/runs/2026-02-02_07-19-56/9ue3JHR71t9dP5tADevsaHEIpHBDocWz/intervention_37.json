More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at their wife for secretly giving them laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. The wife adds laxative powder to his protein shake without telling him. He then gets severe diarrhea, which is unexpected. He yells at her when he finds out, and she says she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife didn't consult him before adding the laxative, which led to a bad reaction. The husband was upset about being kept in the dark and the physical discomfort. Now, the question is about whether his anger and yelling make him at fault.\n\nIn terms of ethics, acting without consent can be a big issue. The wife tried to help but without his knowledge, which could be seen as a violation of his autonomy. However, her intention was to help with a problem he mentioned. On the other hand, the husband's reaction\u2014yelling\u2014might be seen as overreacting, especially since she meant well. But if he feels that his autonomy was respected and he was informed, then her action is wrong. \n\nLegal perspective isn't really applicable here, but morally, consent is important. If someone is altering another person's food or supplements without their knowledge, even with good intentions, it's a breach of trust. The husband has a right to know what's being added to his food. However, his response (yelling) might be seen as a justified reaction to the lack of communication, but maybe he overreacted in terms of the emotion. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author yelled, that's a negative action. But the root cause is the wife's secrecy. So, is the husband wrong for his reaction? It depends on cultural norms and how much weight we give to intent vs. action. The wife's action was wrong, but his reaction might be a consequence. However, yelling could be seen as an unjustified response if he's the one who's upset about her unauthorized action. \n\nAlternatively, if someone acts without consent, they're in the wrong. The husband's anger is a reaction to that, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But the way he expressed his anger (yelling) could be considered a wrong action itself. \n\nHmm. So, the author is in the wrong if his anger and yelling are considered an overreaction. But if the wife's actions were the main issue, then maybe he's not. It's a bit of a balance. The wife's action was unethical, but the husband's response might be seen as a justified upset reaction. However, yelling is a negative action, so maybe he's partially at fault. \n\nBut the user says they think the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, author wrong) or B (no). The user wants to know if their initial thought is correct. \n\nI think the key here is that the wife's action was the main issue. The husband's reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to her unauthorized action. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the yelling was unwarranted given her intentions, then he could be. But since the wife didn't ask, her action is the problem. So, the husband's anger is a reaction to her action, so he's not wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Wait, but maybe the husband's response is wrong because he yelled. So maybe he is wrong. \n\nThis is tricky. If the wife's action is the main issue, then the husband's anger is justified, but yelling could be considered an overreaction. So, maybe he is partially at fault. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the main issue is the wife's action, then the husband's reaction is a consequence. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
