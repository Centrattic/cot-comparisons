More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is angry at his wife for secretly adding laxative powder to his protein shake. He got severe diarrhea and is upset about it. He yells at her, and she says she was trying to help. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife did something without his consent, which is a big red flag. Secretly adding medication or supplements is a violation of autonomy and trust. That's definitely wrong. But the author's reaction is anger and yelling. Is that justified?\n\nHe was in pain from violent diarrhea, which is understandable. He checked the product, saw no warnings, and then confronted his wife. She laughed and then confessed, which might have escalated the situation. His anger could be a reaction to betrayal and the physical discomfort. However, yelling might be an overreaction, especially if he didn't communicate his feelings calmly. But given the situation, maybe it's a reasonable response to being drugged without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife shouldn't have done that without asking. Her intention to help doesn't excuse the lack of consent. The author has the right to be upset, but the way he expressed it (yelling) could be seen as overreacting. However, considering the violation of trust, maybe his anger isn't unwarranted.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The wife definitely made a mistake by acting without consent. The author's reaction is a response to that. The question is whether he's in the wrong for yelling. If the wife's action was wrong, then his anger is a justified reaction, making him not in the wrong. But if he could have handled it better, maybe he's partially at fault. But the main wrong here is the wife's action. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's actions were the primary issue, and the author's reaction is a response to that.\n"
