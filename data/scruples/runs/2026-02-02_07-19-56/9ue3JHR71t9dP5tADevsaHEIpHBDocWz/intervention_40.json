More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife after finding out she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband is on a keto diet and having constipation issues. He told his wife about this. The wife, thinking she's helping, added too much laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband ends up with violent diarrhea, which is a severe reaction he didn't expect. He gets angry, yells at her, and she defends herself by saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife's action was meant to help but had unintended and harmful consequences. The husband's reaction is anger and yelling. The question is whether he's in the wrong for that reaction.\n\nI think about consent and autonomy here. The wife acted without his knowledge or consent, which is a big deal. Even if her intention was good, she overstepped by secretly giving him something that could have serious side effects. On the other hand, the husband's reaction was yelling, which might be excessive. But considering the situation\u2014severe physical distress and finding out his wife did this behind his back\u2014his anger is understandable. \n\nBut the user initially thought the author (husband) is in the wrong. Maybe they think he should have handled it calmly. However, the wife's action was a breach of trust, which could justify his anger. So where's the balance? Yelling is a strong reaction, but the context matters. If the wife's action was a one-time mistake and the husband's response was just anger without lasting harm, maybe neither is entirely wrong. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the wife made a mistake by acting without consent, but the husband's yelling might be a result of being betrayed and physically harmed. However, yelling could be seen as an overreaction. Alternatively, if the wife's action was reckless (using too much laxative), then the husband's anger is justified. \n\nThe key factors are intent and proportionality. The wife intended to help but caused harm. The husband's reaction, while angry, stems from the harm done without his consent. In terms of wrongdoing, both have some responsibility. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the wife's action was the initial problem, then the husband's anger is a reaction to her wrongdoing. However, responding with yelling instead of calmly discussing might not be the best approach, but it's not necessarily being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, I might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong. The wife's action was the main issue, and his anger is a response to that. But maybe the user thinks the husband overreacted. It's a bit of a toss-up. But I need to go with the analysis. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's unauthorized action caused harm, and the husband's anger is a reasonable reaction to being physically affected and betrayed.\n"
