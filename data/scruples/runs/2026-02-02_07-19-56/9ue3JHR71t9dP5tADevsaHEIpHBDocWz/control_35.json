More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he's angry because his wife secretly put laxative powder in his protein shake, leading to violent diarrhea. He's asking if he's at fault for yelling at her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife did something without his consent\u2014adding laxatives. That's a big deal because it goes against his autonomy. She said she was trying to help, maybe because he was constipated from keto. But even if her intention was good, doing it without asking is a problem. People have boundaries, and messing with someone's food or drinks without their knowledge crosses a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband reacted with anger and yelling. That's a valid emotional response to being deceived and physically harmed. But is his reaction excessive? Well, she did something that could be harmful. Yelling might be justified as an immediate reaction to betrayal and the physical discomfort he experienced. However, yelling can escalate conflicts, so maybe there's a better way to handle it, but does that make him in the wrong? Not necessarily. The core issue is her action without consent, which is a bigger problem.\n\nThe key here is consent. She shouldn't have done that regardless of the intention. His anger is a reaction to her violation of trust and autonomy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for getting angry. The wife's actions are the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
