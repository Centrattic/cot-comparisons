More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is on a keto diet and has been experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. Then, he had a really bad case of diarrhea. When he checked the fiber supplements he was taking, he couldn't find any warnings about that. Then he confronted his wife, and she admitted she might have put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was just trying to help. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The wife secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake, which led to severe diarrhea. The author was upset because he wasn't informed and ended up in a lot of discomfort. He reacted with anger and yelling. Now, the issue is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the wife did something without consent. Adding medication or supplements without the other person's knowledge is a big deal. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without permission is a violation of autonomy. People have the right to know what's going into their body, especially when it's something that could have significant health effects. So, the wife's actions could be considered wrong or at least a breach of trust.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction is also a factor. Getting angry and yelling might be an overreaction, depending on the context. If he was in a lot of pain from the diarrhea, his frustration is understandable. But yelling and being aggressive could be seen as disproportionate, especially if his wife was trying to help, albeit in a wrong way. The wife's defense was that she was trying to help, which might be a mitigating factor. So, while her actions were wrong, the author's response might also be excessive.\n\nIs there a middle ground where both parties are partially at fault? The wife acted without consent, which is a problem. The author reacted with anger, which might not be the most constructive response. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife's actions were clearly wrong and she was being defensive, maybe the author's anger is justified. However, yelling might not be the right way to handle it. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not whether there's a better way to handle it.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's anger stems from being deceived and physically harmed. His reaction, while perhaps intense, could be seen as a natural response to betrayal and physical suffering. However, the way he expressed his anger (yelling) might be considered over the top. But the core issue is the wife's actions. The author is not in the wrong for being upset by her unauthorized action. The wife is in the wrong for adding the laxative without consent. The author's yelling is a reaction to her wrongdoing, so maybe he's not in the wrong for feeling that way.\n\nAlternatively, if the question is about whether the author's reaction is justified, it's more of a gray area. But the question specifically is whether he's in the wrong. Since he was the victim of an unauthorized action that caused him harm, his anger is a reasonable emotional response. So, he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
