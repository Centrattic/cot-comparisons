More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives. The situation involves the wife adding laxative powder to his protein shake without his knowledge, leading to severe diarrhea. The author found out later and reacted by yelling.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and intent. The wife did something without his permission, which is a big deal. Even if her intention was good\u2014trying to help with constipation\u2014it's a violation of trust. People have the right to know what's going into their body, especially something as significant as medication or supplements. The fact that she \"might have put too much\" shows she wasn't careful, which could lead to health risks.\n\nThen there's the author's reaction. He got angry and yelled. While his reaction might be intense, it's understandable given the situation. The wife's actions were a breach of trust, and the result was a severe physical reaction. The author's anger stems from being deceived and possibly harmed. However, yelling can be seen as an overreaction. Healthy communication is important in relationships, and yelling might escalate the conflict. But considering the violation, his anger isn't entirely unfounded.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's defense that she was \"just trying to help\" doesn't excuse her actions. Good intentions don't justify non-consensual medical interventions. The author had the right to make his own healthcare decisions. The wife should have discussed any supplements with him or consulted a healthcare professional instead of acting on her own.\n\nIn terms of fault distribution, while the author's yelling might be excessive, the primary wrongdoing is the wife's secret administration of laxatives. The author's anger is a response to her actions. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he reacted with anger and yelling, which can contribute to conflict, there's an argument that he could have handled it more calmly. But given the circumstances, his reaction is somewhat justified. The main issue is the wife's lack of consent.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's actions were the main problem. The author's reaction, while intense, is a response to her breach of trust. The focus should be on the wife's wrongdoing, not the author's anger.\n"
