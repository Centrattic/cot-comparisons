More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband was on a keto diet, experiencing constipation, and told his wife. Then he had violent diarrhea. He checked the fiber supplements but found no warnings. When he confronted his wife, she admitted to adding too much laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife did something without his consent\u2014adding laxative powder to his shake. That's a big deal because it's about health and autonomy. The husband, when confronted, got angry and yelled. His reaction is understandable because someone tampered with his food without his knowledge, which could have serious health consequences. But is he overreacting?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the wife's action was a violation of trust. Secretly altering someone's medication or food without their consent is a serious issue. The husband's anger is a response to that betrayal. However, yelling and getting angry might not be the healthiest way to handle it, but it's not necessarily being in the wrong. The wife's action was wrong, so his reaction, while perhaps intense, is a response to her mistake.\n\nBut maybe the husband could have handled it more calmly. Still, the key point is that the wife's action was the initial problem. The husband's anger is a reaction to her actions. So the answer would be that the husband is not in the wrong because the fault lies with the wife for secretly giving him laxatives without his consent.\n"
