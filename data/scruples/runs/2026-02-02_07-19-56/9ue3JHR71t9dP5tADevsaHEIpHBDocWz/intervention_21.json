More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for getting angry and yelling at his wife after discovering she put laxative powder in his protein shake without his consent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He mentioned this to his wife. Later, he had violent diarrhea and found out his wife had added too much laxative to his shake. He got angry and yelled at her, while she got defensive, saying she was trying to help him.\n\nSo, the key points here: The wife acted without his consent, which is a big issue. She took it upon herself to alter his protein shake with a laxative, which could have serious health consequences if he wasn't aware. The husband then reacted with anger and yelling. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The wife's actions were unauthorized and potentially dangerous. Even if her intention was to help, doing so without consent is a breach of trust and could be seen as manipulative or harmful. The husband was right to be upset about her interference, especially since it caused him physical distress.\n\nHowever, his reaction was to yell and get angry, which is a valid emotional response given the circumstances. But is he in the wrong for that? If the wife's actions were wrong or harmful, then his anger is justified. The question is whether his reaction is proportional. Yelling in anger is a common reaction when someone feels betrayed or harmed, especially in a personal relationship. \n\nBut maybe the husband could have handled it differently, like expressing his feelings without yelling. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether he could have done better. Since his wife's actions were problematic, his anger is a reasonable reaction, so he might not be in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the wife's intention was genuinely to help and she made a mistake in dosage, maybe the husband's yelling was too harsh. But the problem is the unauthorized action itself. Even if her intention was good, acting without consent is a boundary issue. \n\nIn this case, the wife's actions are likely the main issue. The husband's reaction is a response to her breach of trust. So, based on the information, the husband is not in the wrong for being angry. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
