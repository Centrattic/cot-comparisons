More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. Then he had violent diarrhea. When checking the fiber supplements he was taking, he found out that his wife had secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake, thinking she was helping. He got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband was in the wrong for his reaction. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not wrong).\n\nLet me break it down. The wife acted without his consent. That's a big point. He didn't know she was adding something to his food, which is a violation of his autonomy. Even if her intention was good, doing something without asking can be problematic. The husband had a legitimate reason to be upset because he experienced severe diarrhea, which is a harmful side effect. His anger is understandable because she manipulated his food without his knowledge.\n\nHowever, his reaction was yelling and getting angry. Whether that's justified depends on the context. He had a physical reaction that was severe, and he discovered she was the cause. His anger stems from being deceived and experiencing discomfort. On the other hand, the wife could have communicated her intention first. But the husband's reaction might be seen as overreacting if it was aggressive without considering her intent to help.\n\nBut in this case, the act of secretly adding a medication (even if it's a laxative) without consent is a breach of trust. The husband's anger is a reaction to being manipulated, which is a valid concern. The wife's defense of \"trying to help\" doesn't negate the fact that she acted without permission. Therefore, the husband's anger isn't unwarranted. However, yelling might not be the best way to handle it, but the question is about being in the wrong, not the best communication method.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't in the wrong. The wife's actions were the root issue. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
