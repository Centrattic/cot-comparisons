More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife who secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He mentioned this to his wife. Later, he had severe diarrhea and found out his wife had put too much laxative powder in his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her because she was trying to help but went about it secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife did something without his consent, which caused him significant discomfort. The husband reacted with anger, yelling, and the wife was defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The wife's action was a breach of trust and autonomy. Even with good intentions, she didn't ask him before adding something to his food. That's a violation of his right to control what goes into his body. The husband's anger might be understandable given the severe reaction he had. However, yelling might be an excessive reaction. But considering the violation of trust and the harm caused, maybe his anger isn't entirely over the top. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife should have discussed any interventions with him. Secretly adding laxatives is a big no-no. But the husband's response of yelling could be seen as not handling the situation calmly. However, the severity of the diarrhea and the betrayal might justify his anger. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife is clearly at fault for acting without consent. The husband's anger is a reaction, but yelling is a poor way to handle it. However, the initial wrong was on the wife. But the question is about the husband's reaction. If he's in the wrong for yelling, maybe because he overreacted, but if the wife is the one who did something unethical, maybe he's not entirely wrong. \n\nIt's tricky. The wife's action is worse, but the husband's reaction might still be in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe both are at fault. But the question is specifically about the author (the husband). If the answer is A (yes, he's wrong) because yelling is inappropriate, even if he's upset. Or B (no, he's not wrong) because the wife's actions were worse. \n\nI think the consensus in AITA threads often considers the severity of the initial action. Since the wife did something unethical, the husband's anger is more understandable. But yelling might still be in the wrong. However, in some cases, people's reactions are excused if the other person was clearly in the wrong. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because the wife did something wrong first. But maybe the husband should have handled it calmly. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the wife's actions were worse, maybe the answer is B. However, if the husband's reaction is considered over the top regardless of the wife's actions, then A. I'm leaning towards B because the wife's action was worse, so his anger is a justified reaction even if the yelling was not the best approach. But some might argue that yelling is in the wrong regardless. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the person who did the secret action is more at fault. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong here for being angry. So B. But others might say he should have stayed calm. But given the context, maybe B is correct.\n"
