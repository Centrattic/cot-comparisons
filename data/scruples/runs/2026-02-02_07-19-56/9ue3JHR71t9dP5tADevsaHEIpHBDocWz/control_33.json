More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for yelling at his wife after she secretly gave him laxatives.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about it. She, without his knowledge, added laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband then had severe diarrhea, which he found out was because of the laxatives. He got angry and yelled at her, and she defended herself by saying she was trying to help.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, acting without consent, even if well-intentioned, can be a problem. His wife did something without asking him, which is a breach of trust. He had the right to make his own healthcare decisions. But maybe the husband overreacted by yelling, which could be seen as a poor response. However, the act of secretly administering medication without consent is a significant issue. The wife's action, while meant to help, was invasive and could have serious consequences. The husband's anger might be justified because his autonomy was violated. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband could have handled the situation with more calmness. Yelling can escalate things, and maybe he should have discussed it without raising his voice. But the core issue is that the wife overstepped by not getting his permission. So the author's anger is a reaction to a breach of trust, not the severity of the situation per se. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry and yelling, given the context. The real fault lies with the wife for acting without consent. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
