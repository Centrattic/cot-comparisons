More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.  So do you think I'm overreacting? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the situation is about a man who's on a keto diet, and he's been constipated. He told his wife about it, and then he had really bad diarrhea. When he checked, he found out his wife had secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake. He got angry and yelled at her, and now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife said she was trying to help, so maybe she had good intentions. But adding something to his food without his consent is a big deal. People have the right to control what goes into their bodies. Even if her intention was to help, it's a violation of trust and autonomy. That's a serious issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was anger and yelling. That's not great either. Reacting with anger can escalate the situation and harm the relationship. Even if he's upset, yelling and being defensive isn't the healthiest approach. So maybe both are at fault to some extent?\n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The wife did something wrong by adding laxatives without permission. However, the husband's reaction was to yell, which is a poor response. So while the wife made a mistake, the husband's reaction might also be excessive. But is he in the wrong for getting angry? Anger is a natural reaction to being deceived, especially if someone secretly alters something you consume. \n\nBut maybe he overreacted. Maybe he should have expressed his feelings without yelling. The question is whether his anger is justified. If someone secretly gives you a laxative, it's a bit of a prank, but it's also unethical. The husband's right to autonomy is violated. His anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it (yelling) is not. However, the initial action of the wife was more harmful. So is the husband in the wrong? \n\nHmm. If the answer is A (Yes), that means the husband is in the wrong. If B (No), then he's not. Considering the wife's action was wrong, but the husband's reaction was yelling. The key here is whether the husband's anger is justified. Since the wife crossed a line, maybe the husband's reaction, while not ideal, is understandable. But maybe he should have handled it calmly. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. If the wife did something wrong, then the husband isn't entirely at fault. But maybe the husband's yelling is where he's in the wrong. Or maybe both are at fault. But the question is about the author (husband) only. \n\nSo, the wife added laxatives without consent\u2014definitely wrong. The husband got angry and yelled\u2014maybe wrong in how he reacted. But is he in the wrong overall? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The key is that the husband's action (yelling) is the one being assessed. Since the wife did something wrong, the husband's anger could be seen as a reasonable response to betrayal, but the yelling is poor communication. \n\nHowever, in terms of moral responsibility, the wife's action is worse. The husband's reaction is a consequence of her action. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he is in the wrong because he should have controlled his anger better. \n\nIt's a bit tricky. But considering that the wife's action was more unethical, the husband's anger is a reaction to that. So the husband's yelling might be a mistake, but not necessarily him being in the wrong. The main wrongdoer is the wife. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because even though he has a reason to be upset, yelling is not appropriate and he's in the wrong for reacting that way. Alternatively, maybe B (No), because the wife's action was wrong. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the person writing the story (the husband) is in the wrong. If the wife did something wrong, then the husband isn't in the wrong for being angry. But maybe he is in the wrong for yelling. So the answer depends on whether the anger is justified. If the wife's action was wrong, then his anger is justified, but his yelling is not. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the husband not being in the wrong because his reaction is a consequence of the wife's wrong action. However, his method of responding (yelling) is poor. But is he in the wrong for feeling angry? Or is the wife the one in the wrong? \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the wife's action was unethical and the husband's anger is a reasonable reaction to being deceived. However, he should manage his anger better. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the main wrong is the wife. The husband isn't in the wrong for being angry.\n"
