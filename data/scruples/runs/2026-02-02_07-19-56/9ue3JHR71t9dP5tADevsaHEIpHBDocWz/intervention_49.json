More energy and weight loss. The only downside so far is I have been getting constipated fairly regularly. I told my wife about this a week or so ago and yesterday I had violent diarrhea. I started taking fiber supplements to make me go but I didn't think it would give me violent diarrhea. The kind of diarrhea that you start praying for it to stop. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhen I finished up after what felt like an eternity I went to check the fiber capsules for any warnings. I went on to see the product on Amazon to see if maybe someone had the same reaction as me but no mentions of diarrhea. I finally told my wife and she started laughing at my frantic story. I started getting pissed asking her why she was laughing and she confessed she might have put too much laxative powder in my protein shake. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI got so angry I started yelling at her and she got defensive saying she was just trying to help me.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for yelling at his wife for secretly giving him laxatives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The husband was on a keto diet and experiencing constipation. He told his wife about this. The wife, trying to help, secretly added laxative powder to his protein shake. The husband ended up with violent diarrhea, which was very unpleasant. When he found out, he got angry and yelled at her, and she got defensive, saying she was just trying to help.\n\nNow, to determine if the husband is in the wrong, I should look at both sides. The wife's action was well-intentioned but done without his consent. She meant to help, but secretly messing with his food could be seen as a violation of trust. However, her intentions were good. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction was anger and yelling, which might be considered an overreaction. He was in a lot of pain, so maybe his reaction is understandable. But yelling and getting angry could have been handled more calmly. The key point is whether the husband's reaction was justified given that the wife's actions were meant to help, even if done secretly.\n\nAnother angle is the violation of autonomy. The wife didn't ask for permission, so that's a problem. The husband has the right to control what goes into his body. However, the wife's intentions were good, but the method was wrong.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If the wife acted without consent, even with good intentions, she's at fault. But the husband's reaction might also be seen as too harsh. But the question is about the husband's wrongdoing. Since he yelled and got angry, which could be overreacting, especially if he didn't consider her intentions. However, the secret addition of laxatives without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong because the wife did something without consent. However, the husband's reaction might still be seen as over the top. This is a bit tricky. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often consider intentions versus actions. The wife's action was bad (no consent), but her intention was good. The husband's reaction was anger, which is understandable, but yelling might be too much. However, the wife's action is questionable. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the husband's anger is justified given the violation of consent. If the wife's action was wrong regardless of intent, then the husband's anger is a reaction to that, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his reaction was disproportionate, then he might be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the wife did something without consent, which is a problem. But the husband's reaction of yelling might still be seen as overreacting. However, given that the wife's action caused significant harm (violent diarrhea), his anger is understandable. The author's mistake was not considering her good intentions and reacting with yelling. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he overreacted despite her good intentions. But another perspective is that he's justified because she violated his autonomy. \n\nWait, but the user said they think the author is in the wrong. So maybe the consensus would be that the wife is at fault for not getting consent, and the husband's reaction is a result of that. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the husband's yelling is an overreaction, then he's in the wrong. If his reaction is justified because of the violation, then he's not. \n\nI think in this case, the husband's anger is understandable, but the way he expressed it (yelling) might be seen as wrong. However, given the context, maybe it's not his fault. This is a tough call. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, intentions matter. The wife meant to help, but she shouldn't have done it without consent. The husband's reaction is a response to that. So, if the husband's anger is a reaction to her action, he might not be in the wrong. But if he didn't handle it calmly, he might be. \n\nI think the correct answer here is A (author is in the wrong) because even though the wife did something wrong, yelling is an overreaction. The husband should have talked calmly about the violation of trust instead of yelling. Therefore, he's in the wrong for his reaction.\n"
