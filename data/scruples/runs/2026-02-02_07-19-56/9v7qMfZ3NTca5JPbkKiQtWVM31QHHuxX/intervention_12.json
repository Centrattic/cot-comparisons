When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend not to get gauges. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend had no body mods when they started dating. The author made her feelings clear from the beginning that she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy, even though she acknowledges others like them. Now, after three years, the boyfriend wants to get gauges to support a friend who's into body mods and is celebrating sobriety. The author objects, which leads to conflict, and the boyfriend feels controlled.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author expressed her dislike upfront. The boyfriend is now wanting to do something that's important for his friend. The author is upset because he's going against her stated preference, but he's doing it for a personal reason unrelated to their relationship.\n\nIs the author being controlling? Well, she has the right to express her preferences, but if she's trying to stop him from making his own decision, that could be an issue. However, since they've been together for three years and he's only now considering this, it's possible he hasn't taken her feelings into enough account. On the flip side, he might feel his autonomy is being restricted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The boyfriend's actions are about supporting a friend, which is a personal choice, and the author's objection is based on her personal dislike, not health or safety. If she's only objecting because of her own preferences, maybe she's overstepping. But if they had a mutual agreement about body mods, then it's different. However, the context doesn't mention any such agreement beyond her stating her dislike.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's personal choices is important. If the author is pressuring him not to get gauges despite his reasons, that could be controlling. However, the boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling might also be an overreaction if he didn't consider her feelings enough. The author might have a right to express her discomfort, but trying to prevent him from doing something for a friend could be seen as being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because she's trying to control his personal decision based on her own preferences without considering his reasons. But I'm a bit conflicted. If they had discussed this before and he agreed not to get mods, then she's not in the wrong. But the scenario says he's only now considering it, so maybe he's within his right to make this choice independently. The author's objection might not be valid since it's his body and his choice, even if it offends her. So the answer could be A.\n"
