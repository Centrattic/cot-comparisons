When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 25-year-old woman, has a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating for three years, and neither of them has any body modifications. When they first met, the author made it clear that she doesn't like body modifications because she thinks they're trashy. She acknowledges that others might like them, but it's just her personal opinion.\n\nNow, the boyfriend wants to get small gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity for his friend who's a body mod enthusiast and has recently become sober. The author objects, saying she hates it because it reminds her of the scumbag types her sister used to date. The boyfriend gets angry and calls her controlling, which makes the author question if she wants to continue the relationship.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Hmm. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did communicate her dislike for body mods early on. However, the boyfriend is now making a personal choice that's meaningful to him, even if it goes against her preferences. The author is upset because she feels her boundaries are being crossed, but the boyfriend feels she's being controlling. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being controlling. The author's objection is based on personal taste and associations, not on health or safety. The boyfriend's action is a personal choice that doesn't directly harm her, though it might affect her emotionally. In relationships, partners often have to respect each other's autonomy unless there's a mutual agreement on certain boundaries. Since the author didn't ask him to not get body mods in the past but only now is objecting to gauges specifically, maybe she's overstepping. However, she did mention her dislike early on, so he should have considered her feelings. But he's also making a personal decision for a friend's milestone. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she has the right to her preferences. On the other, he's asserting his own autonomy. If the author is now using this as a reason to reconsider the relationship, that might indicate deeper issues. But the core issue is whether her asking him not to get gauges is controlling. Since body modification is a personal choice and she didn't agree to mutually exclude such mods from the start, her stance might be seen as controlling. Alternatively, if she made her feelings known and he chose to proceed despite that, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's objection is reasonable. If she's making a general dislike known and he's choosing to do something that goes against that, it's a conflict of values. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy unless there's a mutual agreement. Since she didn't set a boundary that he agreed to, he's within his rights to make his own choice, even if it upsets her. So maybe the author is in the wrong because she's trying to control his personal decision based on her preferences without mutual agreement. But if he had agreed to not get body mods in the past and now is going back, that would be different. Since the initial communication was about her dislike but not an explicit boundary, he's acting on his own choice. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for being controlling. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if she's communicated her dislike strongly and he's ignoring it, maybe he's not respecting her feelings. \n\nThis is tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether the author's objection is a boundary that the boyfriend agreed to. Since she mentioned it when they met but there were no mods before, and now he's choosing to do something new, perhaps she's overreacting. However, if she felt strongly enough about it to bring it up early, it's part of the relationship dynamics. Maybe the boyfriend should have considered how it might affect her when making this decision, even if it's a personal choice. So it's a bit of a both-fault situation, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is AITA, the typical resolution is to say who is in the wrong. Given that, I think the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her feelings early, and the boyfriend is making a choice that disregards her feelings, which could be seen as not respecting her. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I'm conflicted. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is overstepping by trying to control her boyfriend's body modification choices, which are his personal decision. So the answer would be A (she's in the wrong). But I'm not sure. The line between expressing a preference and being controlling can be thin. Since she didn't set a mutual boundary but just expressed dislike, and he's choosing to proceed, maybe he's not wrong. But if she's now using this as a reason to end the relationship because he didn't comply, maybe that's the issue. But the question is whether she is in the wrong for asking him not to get gauges. \n\nIn most cases, people are allowed to have preferences about their partner's appearance, but if it's not a mutual agreement, it's the partner's choice. So the author might not be in the wrong for expressing her dislike, but if she's demanding he not do it, that's where it could be controlling. The key is whether she's enforcing a rule that wasn't agreed upon. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend is choosing to proceed despite that, which is his right. However, if she's making it a deal-breaker for the relationship, that's another issue. But the main question is about the AITA for asking him not to get gauges. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because she had communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend is choosing to proceed, which is his right. But the boyfriend might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
