When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (25F) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend (26M) not to get gauges. They've been dating three years, and she made it clear she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. Now he wants to get gauges for a friend's sobriety, but she's against it. He got mad, called her controlling, and she's considering breaking up.\n\nHmm. So the main points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. She had previously expressed her dislike for body mods. He knew this but still wants to proceed. Is she being controlling, or is she respecting her boundaries?\n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries unless those boundaries are harmful. She's not trying to control his body or force him to do something, but she's expressing her discomfort. However, he's choosing to do something that makes her uncomfortable despite knowing her feelings. That could indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries.\n\nBut wait, he's doing it for a friend's sobriety. Maybe he sees it as important. However, he should have considered her feelings before making the decision. The key here is whether she's overstepping by asking him not to do it. Since it's his body, he has the right to modify it as he chooses. But she's expressing her personal dislike, not forbidding him. \n\nBut she's not forbidding him; she's stating her dislike and that she's uncomfortable. However, if he proceeds and it causes tension, that's on him for not prioritizing her feelings. But she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings. Relationships require compromise. If she respects his decision, even if it goes against her preferences, maybe that's expected. But if he's aware and still goes through with it, that's disrespectful.\n\nWait, but can he be blamed for wanting to do something meaningful for his friend? Or is she justified in feeling hurt because he's disregarding her feelings? It's a bit of a toss-up. However, in terms of who is in the wrong, she's not being controlling if she's just expressing her opinion. The wrong would be on him for not respecting her feelings and pushing through anyway. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's just expressing her feelings and not forcing him to do anything, she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B, No.\n"
