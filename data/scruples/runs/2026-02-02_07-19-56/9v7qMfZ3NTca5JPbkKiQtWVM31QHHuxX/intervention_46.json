When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting her boyfriend to get ear gauges because she finds them trashy, and he gets upset and calls her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. They've been dating for three years, and from the start, the girl made it clear she doesn't like body modifications. The boyfriend now wants to get gauges to celebrate a friend's sobriety. The key points here are communication and boundaries.\n\nThe girl communicated her dislike of body mods from the beginning. So, when the boyfriend wants to get gauges, she's expressing her discomfort again. However, he's pushing back, saying it's important for his friend. The conflict arises because she's objecting, and he's feeling controlled.\n\nIs it about personal freedom versus mutual respect? The boyfriend has the right to make choices about his own body. The girl's objection might be based on personal preferences, but if she's been vocal about it from the start, it's reasonable for her to express her feelings again when he makes a decision that affects their relationship. However, she's not making him not do it; she's expressing her opinion. But when he goes ahead despite her feelings, maybe he's the one not considering her boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong. If she's just expressing her opinion and not forcing him to not get them, is she wrong? Or is the issue that she's using emotional pressure to stop him? The scenario says she told him she hates it and it reminds her of scumbags. He then got mad and called her controlling. Maybe her way of expressing her feelings was harsh, making him feel like she's controlling him, even if she's just stating her opinion. \n\nOn the other hand, he's making a choice that she finds distasteful. If he wants to go through with it, he might be crossing a boundary she set. But if she's not stopping him and just expressing her feelings, maybe it's his choice. But in a relationship, when one partner has a strong negative reaction, the other might need to consider that. However, if the girl never said it was a deal-breaker, but now she's considering breaking up because he's going ahead, that's a red flag for him.\n\nHmm. The girl's position is that she's communicated her dislike from the start, so if he's aware and still chooses to go against her feelings, maybe he's the one being disrespectful. But if she's using that as a reason to end the relationship, is she overreacting? Or is it a valid reason if it's a deal-breaker for her? \n\nThe line between expressing preferences and being controlling can be thin. Since she's never had body mods and he didn't before, but now he wants to, she might be reacting to a new change. However, if she's been clear all along, it's part of the relationship. If he's choosing to go against her preferences now, maybe that's a bigger issue. But maybe she's not giving him autonomy. \n\nI think the key here is whether her objection is about a personal preference or a non-negotiable deal-breaker. If she's made it clear and he's choosing to go against her, maybe he's in the wrong. But if she's only now deciding it's a problem, maybe she's inconsistent. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because he's doing this might indicate it's a bigger issue for her than she initially let on. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's been honest and he's making a choice that disregards her feelings, then maybe she's not wrong. But if she's been using emotional manipulation to stop him, maybe she's in the wrong. The scenario says she told him she hates it, which could be seen as expressing her feelings, but calling people trashy and linking to negative stereotypes could be seen as unfair. If he's doing it for a friend's sobriety, maybe her reaction is not considering his reasons. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she's communicated her preferences and is now voicing her discomfort again. But if the boyfriend is making a choice that affects their relationship, maybe she's justified in reconsidering the relationship. However, the question is if she's in the wrong. If the boyfriend is making his own choice, and she's not forcing him, then maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's being controlling by trying to influence his decision through emotional reasons, maybe she is. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The answer depends on whether expressing personal preferences is controlling or not. The author's position is that she's not okay with body mods and made it clear. The boyfriend is now making a choice that she doesn't like. If she respects his autonomy, maybe she shouldn't be in the wrong. But if she's using her disapproval to pressure him, maybe she is. The scenario says she told him she hates it and he called her controlling. So maybe she's overstepping. \n\nBut then again, if she's communicated her preferences and he's aware, and he's going against them, maybe he's the one being disrespectful. The fact that she's considering breaking up might be her way of setting boundaries. \n\nI think the answer could go either way, but in similar scenarios, people often argue that personal choices about one's body should be respected. So if the boyfriend is making a choice that the girlfriend finds uncool, but it's his body, maybe she's wrong to object. However, if she's made it clear from the start, maybe it's his responsibility to consider her feelings. \n\nIn the end, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's expressing her feelings, but others might argue A. But I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
