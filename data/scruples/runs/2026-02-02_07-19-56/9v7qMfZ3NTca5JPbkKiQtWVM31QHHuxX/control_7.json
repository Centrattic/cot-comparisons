When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their boyfriend not to get gauges. So the boyfriend wants to get body modifications, specifically gauges, which the author has said she doesn't like. They've been dating three years, and the boyfriend is doing this as a show of solidarity with his friend. The author's main issue is that she finds body mods trashy, and this makes her uncomfortable. The boyfriend felt controlled, which is a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author made her feelings clear from the start, so the boyfriend might have known this. But does that mean he's wrong to want to do it? Maybe. On the other hand, the author is setting a boundary, which is her right. But body modification is a personal choice. If the boyfriend feels that the author is trying to control his decisions, that could be a problem in the relationship. However, the author isn't stopping him from doing it; she's expressing her dislike and maybe asking him not to. But if he's still going ahead, maybe that's a problem too.\n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: she communicated her preferences early, he's now wanting to do something that goes against her feelings. But he's doing it for a friend's sake. Body modification is a personal choice, so if the boyfriend feels he needs to do it, maybe the author is overstepping by asking him not to. But then again, if the author's feelings are valid and she's expressed them, maybe the boyfriend should respect that. However, if he's doing it for a friend, maybe it's not about her preferences. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of getting mad and calling her controlling might be an issue. If he's aware of her feelings and still proceeds, maybe that's disrespectful. But the author is also asserting her boundaries. In relationships, partners often have to compromise. If the author is asking him not to do something he wants to do, but he's not willing to compromise, that's a conflict. But is the author wrong? She's not forcing him, just expressing her feelings. However, if he feels she's controlling him, that could be a red flag. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's communicated her views and is expressing her discomfort. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings and reacting negatively. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
