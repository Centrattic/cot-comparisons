When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend (25F) doesn't like body modifications, especially gauges. She made that clear when they met, and they've been dating for three years. Now the boyfriend (26M) wants to get gauges to support a friend who's sober, but the girlfriend is upset and thinks he's being uncooperative. He got mad and called her controlling, and she's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made her stance on body mods clear from the start. The boyfriend knew this but went ahead anyway. He has a reason related to a friend, but the girlfriend feels it's against her values. The question is whether she's being controlling or if he's respecting her boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author communicated her dislike early on, which is important. The boyfriend, however, is choosing to go against her expressed preferences. The reason he gives is for a friend's sobriety, which might be valid, but does that outweigh her feelings? It's a personal choice, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. On the other hand, she's asking him not to get gauges, which could be seen as controlling if she's imposing her preferences without considering his autonomy. But since she made it clear from the beginning, it's part of the relationship dynamic. The boyfriend's anger for not respecting her boundary might be an issue. The author's perspective is that she's standing by her values, but if he's willing to go against her wishes, that could affect the relationship's compatibility. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stating her preferences, but maybe she should've discussed the situation more to understand his motives. However, the boyfriend's reaction and decision to proceed might be the bigger issue here. Relationships require mutual respect. If he knew her stance and still chose to do it, that's a problem. So, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Like, if he's making a personal statement or supporting a friend, but she's uncomfortable. It's a tough call. But since she communicated her feelings upfront and he's choosing to go against them, it's possible he's the one in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
