When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the author expressing disapproval.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made her feelings clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating three years, and nothing changed until now. The boyfriend wants to get gauges for a friend's sobriety celebration. The author objects, and he gets angry, calling her controlling. She's considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes despite knowing her stance.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's stance is based on personal dislike and past associations. She communicated her feelings early on. The boyfriend, on the other hand, wants to support a friend, which is a personal choice. However, the conflict arises because he's making a decision that affects their relationship dynamics. \n\nIs the author being controlling? Body modifications are personal choices. If she's okay with other body piercings but not gauges, maybe there's a line she's not respecting. If she's against any body mods, then maybe she's being too restrictive. But she's not forcing him to do anything; she's expressing her dislike. However, the boyfriend might feel that her disapproval is controlling his choice, especially since they've been together three years. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on personal taste, not safety or health. Relationships require compromise. If the boyfriend's choice is within his right and the author's disapproval is causing conflict without valid reasons, maybe she's overstepping. On the other hand, if they had mutual agreements about body mods earlier, then the boyfriend breaking that might be the issue.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend getting angry and calling her controlling could be a red flag about his reaction. But the core issue is whether the author has the right to influence her partner's body modification decisions. Since body modifications are personal and not inherently harmful, the author's disapproval might not be a valid reason to be upset. She should respect his autonomy unless there's a valid concern. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his choice, even though she communicated her feelings. The boyfriend should consider her feelings but also have the right to make his own decisions. The answer might be A (author is wrong) because she's being controlling over a personal choice.\n"
