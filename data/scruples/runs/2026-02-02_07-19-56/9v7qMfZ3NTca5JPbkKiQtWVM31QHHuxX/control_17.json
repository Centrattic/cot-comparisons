When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the woman is at fault for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been dating for three years. She made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them \"trashy,\" linking them to negative associations from her sister's past. Now, her boyfriend wants to get gauges in solidarity with a friend who's sober. She objects, and he accuses her of being controlling. She's considering breaking up because he's going against her wishes.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the key points here are communication and boundaries. She expressed her feelings from the beginning, which is good. He knew her stance but still chose to pursue the gauges. However, body modification is a personal choice. While she's communicated her dislike, does that mean she has the right to dictate his decisions? It's a balance between respecting each other's autonomy.\n\nOn one hand, she's not trying to prevent him from getting a tattoo or piercing that he wants for himself, but rather a specific one that has meaning to his friend. On the other hand, he might feel that her opinion is controlling because she's set a boundary about body mods in general. However, he also knew her stance and is now making a choice that goes against her comfort. \n\nBut wait, did she ask him not to do it after he had already decided? The question is whether she's wrong for asking. If she's communicated her feelings early on and he's making a choice that affects her negatively, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if he's making a personal choice that she's uncomfortable with, he should respect her feelings to some extent. But where's the line between respecting boundaries and controlling behavior?\n\nAlso, considering that he's doing it for a friend's solidarity, which is a personal reason, she might not have the right to stop him. However, she's expressing discomfort, which is valid. So it's a gray area. The answer might depend on whether controlling behavior is about forcing a choice without considering the other person's wishes. Since she's made her stance clear and he's choosing to proceed, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him not to do it now without considering his reasons, maybe there's an issue. However, she's stating her feelings again, which is her right. So perhaps the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
