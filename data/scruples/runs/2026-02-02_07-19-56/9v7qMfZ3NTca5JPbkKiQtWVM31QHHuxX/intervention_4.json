When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend asking her boyfriend not to get gauges, which he wants to do as a show of solidarity with his friend who's a body mod enthusiast and recently got sober. The boyfriend got mad and accused her of being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The girlfriend made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body mods. The boyfriend knew this when they started dating three years ago. Now he wants to get gauges, not for fashion, but to support a friend. The girlfriend's reasoning is that they remind her of people she doesn't like, even though she acknowledges not everyone into mods is like that. The boyfriend feels she's being controlling, leading her to consider breaking up.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the girlfriend is being reasonable or overstepping. She's making a request based on her personal preferences, but he's making a decision that affects his own body. However, since they're in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual respect and consideration for each other's feelings. \n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend has the right to his own body modifications, especially if it's meaningful to him. On the other hand, the girlfriend has communicated her feelings, so there's a conflict here. The question is whether her request is reasonable given that he already knew her stance. The boyfriend's decision to go ahead might be seen as dismissive of her feelings, but then again, he's acting on his own autonomy.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. But maybe I should consider if her stance is based on valid reasons. She mentions it's not just about fashion but because it reminds her of people she associates with negative traits. However, she also acknowledges that not all people with mods are like that. The boyfriend's reason for getting the gauges is about supporting a friend, which could be seen as a legitimate personal choice.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend had a strong aversion, maybe she should have discussed it more openly and tried to reach a compromise. However, the boyfriend's decision to proceed without considering her feelings further might also be an issue. The key point is that he knew her dislike beforehand, yet went ahead, possibly disregarding her feelings. But he's also making a personal choice here.\n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between personal autonomy and respecting a partner's feelings. Since the boyfriend is making a decision that affects his own body and the girlfriend's aversion is based on personal preference (even if it's linked to past experiences), maybe the girlfriend isn't entirely in the wrong. However, the boyfriend might have a right to his choice. Alternatively, if the aversion is causing significant distress and the boyfriend is disregarding that, then maybe the girlfriend isn't at fault. But I'm a bit torn here. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario. The boyfriend's action might be seen as a boundary violation if he knew her feelings and went against them. But he's also acting on his own autonomy. It's a tough call. Maybe the right answer is B (not in the wrong) because the boyfriend is making a personal choice despite the girlfriend's feelings, but the girlfriend's request is based on her own preferences. However, the boyfriend's actions might be seen as not respecting her feelings. Hmm. Alternatively, the girlfriend's aversion is personal and not a deal-breaker unless they had a mutual agreement. Since they didn't have an agreement, maybe he's not wrong to proceed. But if the girlfriend feels it's a deal-breaker now, that's a different issue. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because she communicated her feelings and the boyfriend's decision to proceed without considering her could be his fault. Wait, but in the scenario, the boyfriend is doing it for a friend, which might add context. I think the answer is B, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the answer could be A if the author is being controlling. But I think the key is whether the boyfriend's action is a reasonable personal choice vs. the author's feelings. Since the author's aversion is personal and not something they agreed on, maybe the answer is B. So, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
