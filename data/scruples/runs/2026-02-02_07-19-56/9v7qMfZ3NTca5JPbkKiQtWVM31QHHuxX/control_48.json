When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong, labeled as AITA (Am I the Asshole). The question is to answer A or B.\n\nFirst, the scenario: A 25-year-old female has a 26-year-old boyfriend. They've been dating for three years. The woman made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. Now, the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges as a solidarity gesture for his friend who's into body mods and recently became sober. The woman objects, leading the boyfriend to get angry and call her controlling. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The woman communicated her feelings early on. The boyfriend is now wanting to do something that conflicts with her preferences. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting him to proceed despite her expressed discomfort.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The woman had set boundaries, so she has the right to her feelings. However, body modifications are personal choices, and the boyfriend might feel his autonomy is being restricted. But since she made her stance clear from the beginning, it's not necessarily controlling unless she's imposing it without his consent. However, the boyfriend is making a choice that matters to him, and the woman is opposing it, which could be a test of their relationship's compatibility.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If she made it clear and he's now choosing to go against that, maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. On the other hand, if she's using it as a deal-breaker, maybe they need to discuss whether this is a deal-breaker for both. The woman isn't forcing him; she's expressing her discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling might be the issue here. The woman isn't in the wrong for having her feelings, as long as she's not coercing him. It's about mutual respect. If he's okay with proceeding despite her opinion, that's his choice, but she's not wrong for not wanting to support it. So the answer might be B, meaning she's not in the wrong.\n"
