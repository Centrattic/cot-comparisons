When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author (25F) who told her boyfriend (26M) not to get gauges. They've been dating three years, and when they met, she was clear she doesn't like body modifications. Now the boyfriend wants to get gauges for a friend's sobriety, but the author is upset and thinks he's being controlling. She's considering breaking up because he's going against her wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The key points are communication and boundaries. The author made her stance clear from the start, so the boyfriend should have known. But he's choosing to go against her wishes now. However, body modifications are a personal choice, even if it's in a relationship. The boyfriend's reason (solidarity with a friend) isn't trivial, so is there a line between respecting boundaries and being controlling?\n\nThe author argues she finds body mods trashy and associates them with negative examples. The boyfriend feels controlled. The question is whether the author is being reasonable or overstepping. In relationships, partners have different values, and while communication is important, you can't control each other's personal choices unless there's a mutual agreement. The author set a boundary early on, but the boyfriend is now making a choice that the author dislikes. The problem is whether this is a deal-breaker. \n\nSome might say the author is in the wrong for pressuring her boyfriend not to express himself, especially since he's doing it for a friend's significant milestone. Others might say she's right to stick to her boundaries if she's uncomfortable with the change. However, the boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling suggests he might feel his autonomy is being violated. The author's issue isn't with the act itself but the association with certain types of people, which might not be a fair judgment.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. Even if she communicated her dislike, the boyfriend's decision to get gauges for a friend's sobriety is his personal choice. The author's reaction might be overstepping because body modifications are a personal expression, and she's imposing her preferences on him. Unless there was a prior agreement that neither would get body mods, it's his right to choose. The fact that she's considering breaking up because he's doing something she dislikes despite knowing her stance shows that her boundaries might be too rigid. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
