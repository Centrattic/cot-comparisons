When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she asked her boyfriend not to get gauges, and he's upset, saying she's being controlling. She's considering breaking up because he went ahead despite her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. They've been dating for three years. When they met, she told him she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. He had none before, and neither did she. Now he wants to get gauges as a gesture of solidarity with a friend who's sober. She's not okay with it because of her past associations, even though she acknowledges not all people with mods are \"trashy.\" He got angry and called her controlling. She's conflicted about staying in the relationship.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she made her feelings clear from the start. He knew her stance. Now he wants to do something that she finds unattractive or associated with negative traits. But he's doing it for a friend's sobriety, which is a personal choice. The question is about whether she has the right to ask him not to do it. \n\nOn one hand, in a relationship, respecting each other's preferences is important. If she's made her dislike known, and he decides to go against her wishes, that could be seen as dismissive. But he's also entitled to his own choices. The line between respecting boundaries and becoming controlling is tricky here. If she's not trying to control him but expressing her comfort level, maybe she's not wrong. However, if her opposition is based on stereotypes and she's trying to dictate his body choices, that could be controlling. But she's not forcing him; she's expressing her feelings. He's the one choosing to proceed despite her feelings. So maybe she's not in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The key is whether her objection is a legitimate part of her identity or if she's trying to control him. Since she made her stance clear early on, and he's now choosing to act against her wishes, maybe she's justified in her feelings. But the fact that he's getting it for a friend's support adds another layer. Maybe he's prioritizing his friend's needs over her feelings. But the question is about her wrongdoing. If she's asking him not to do it, but he's going anyway, perhaps she's not wrong. However, if her opposition is based on stereotypes (like linking mods to \"scumbag\" people), maybe that's where she's in the wrong. But she does acknowledge that not all are like that. So it's a personal preference. So in the end, the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong) because she expressed her feelings, and he's choosing to proceed. The problem is more about his reaction than her asking.\n"
