When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get gauges, but the girlfriend told him she doesn't like body mods. He's getting upset because he says it's for a friend's sobriety, and she's against it.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author made her stance clear from the start, so the boyfriend should have known her preferences. But now he's pushing for something she's uncomfortable with. Is it about control? Well, she's expressing her feelings, which is valid. However, the boyfriend's argument is about solidarity with a friend. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend's reason is important. If it's to celebrate a friend's sobriety, maybe it's a meaningful gesture. However, the girlfriend's feelings are also legitimate. The boyfriend got angry and called her controlling, which might be an overreaction. \n\nIs she being controlling? She's not forcing him to do anything, just expressing her dislike. The issue is whether her opposition is reasonable. Since she's upfront about her preferences, it's not about control but personal taste. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's decision affects their relationship. He might feel his autonomy is being restricted. But he should have considered her feelings before proceeding. Since they've been together three years, maybe he's aware of her stance. \n\nThe key points: She communicated her dislike early, he didn't take it into account, and he got angry. She's considering ending the relationship because he's ignoring her feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, mutual respect is crucial. She's not wrong for having her opinions. The boyfriend's reaction might be more at fault because he's dismissing her feelings and acting out of anger. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
