When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the woman) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation involves a three-year relationship where she previously communicated her dislike for body modifications. Now, the boyfriend wants to get gauges to support a friend who's sober, which upsets the author.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The woman had made her stance clear from the start. That's important because the boyfriend is aware of her feelings. However, the boyfriend is choosing to proceed, which the woman sees as dismissive. He argues it's for a friend's solidarity, which is a valid reason, but the woman feels it's a line crossed because of their prior discussions.\n\nThe question is about whether she's controlling. The boyfriend's anger and calling her controlling is a red flag. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she communicated her dislike clearly and he decides to act against her wishes, that could indicate a lack of respect for her feelings. On the other hand, if she's not open to any compromise or understanding his reasons, that might also be an issue. However, the main issue here seems to be that the boyfriend is not respecting her established boundaries. The woman is within her right to express her feelings and set boundaries, especially if it's something that's a deal-breaker for her. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he might be overreacting or not considering her feelings enough. So, I think the author is not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's actions and his reaction are more problematic.\n"
