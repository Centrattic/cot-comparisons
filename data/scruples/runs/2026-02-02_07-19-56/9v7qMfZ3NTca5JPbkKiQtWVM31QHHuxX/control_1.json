When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 25-year-old woman) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The boyfriend is 26, and they've been dating for three years. The key points here are about personal boundaries in a relationship and the impact of one person's preferences on the other.\n\nFirst, the author made her stance clear from the beginning: she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. She associates them with negative stereotypes, even though she acknowledges that not everyone into body mods is like that. Now, her boyfriend wants to get small gauges as a gesture of solidarity with his friend, who's a big into body modifications and has become sober. The boyfriend thinks this celebration is important, but the author is upset and feels her partner is being controlling. He's angry with her for trying to stop him, and she's considering ending the relationship because he's going ahead despite her objections.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author expressed her dislike of body mods early on. If she's uncomfortable with this, it's reasonable for her to express that again. However, three years into the relationship, is it fair for her to expect her partner not to get a body modification just because she doesn't like them? Maybe not if the partner feels it's important to him and their friend. On the other hand, the boyfriend knew her feelings when he agreed to the relationship, so isn't he also responsible for considering her feelings? He's choosing to do something that makes her uncomfortable, which could be seen as disregarding her boundaries. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nIt's a classic case of conflicting personal choices versus relationship boundaries. The boyfriend might see this as a personal choice that's important to him, while the author sees it as a violation of her comfort zone. The fact that the boyfriend got angry and called her controlling suggests a lack of compromise. The author's reaction is based on her personal feelings and associations, which are valid, but in a healthy relationship, there's room for negotiation. However, if the author is making a demand that her partner not participate in something he feels is meaningful, even after three years, that could be seen as controlling. But maybe not, if she's being honest about her feelings. The line between expressing a preference and being controlling can be blurry here.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have the autonomy to make certain personal choices unless there's a mutual agreement. The author's issue is that her partner isn't respecting her feelings, but if he's not willing to compromise, that's a problem. However, the author is also standing up for her own comfort, which is valid. But if she's making a demand that he can't or won't meet, leading to major conflict, maybe she's overstepping. The key factor is whether the author is in the wrong for expressing her dislike of something that's not inherently harmful but is a personal choice. Since the boyfriend didn't agree to this condition when he entered the relationship, is it fair for the author to now oppose it? Alternatively, maybe the author should have considered that her partner might want to explore this later. It's a tough call. The answer hinges on whether the author's stance is an unreasonable control over her partner's body versus a reasonable expression of her feelings. Given that body modifications are a personal choice and the author's issue is based on personal taste, not health or safety, the boyfriend's decision to proceed could be seen as a valid personal choice, making the author's objection more about control. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not allowing her partner to make this choice, especially after he knew her feelings from the start. But if he's ignoring her feelings, he might also be at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's expressing her feelings, even if they lead to conflict. But wait, maybe the boyfriend is the one overstepping by not considering her feelings after agreeing to be with someone who dislikes body mods. The answer could swing either way. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend knew her views and still wants to proceed without compromise, he's the one being controlling. The author is not in the wrong for expressing her discomfort. So the answer is B.\n"
