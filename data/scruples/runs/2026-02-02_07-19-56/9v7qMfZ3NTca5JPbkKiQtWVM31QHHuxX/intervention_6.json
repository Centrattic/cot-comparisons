When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. \n\nFirst, the author made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy, linking them to some negative associations from her sister's past relationships. When the boyfriend wants to get gauges now, she expresses her dislike again, and he feels it's controlling. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect in a relationship. The boyfriend is making a personal choice for a meaningful reason\u2014supporting a friend's sobriety. The author is trying to influence his decision based on her preferences. Even though she communicated her feelings beforehand, his decision to go ahead might be about asserting his own autonomy. \n\nBut does that make her controlling? It's important to consider if her request is reasonable. She's not forbidding him but expressing her discomfort. However, if he feels it's important for his friendship and personal expression, her objection might come off as controlling, especially if she's made it a deal-breaker. \n\nOn the flip side, he should have considered her feelings more, given her prior stance. Maybe open communication could have found a middle ground. But since he got angry and labeled her as controlling, it suggests a lack of empathy from his side too. \n\nSo, in a relationship, both partners need to balance personal freedom with respecting each other's boundaries. If she's not trying to control him but express her feelings, and he's making a choice that's important to him, maybe both have valid points. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not trying to control but express her feelings, and he's overreacting, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if her prior stance is a hard boundary he's ignoring, then maybe he's in the wrong. The answer isn't straightforward, but the user thinks she is in the wrong. I need to decide based on these factors.\n"
