When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get gauges, and the author (the girlfriend) is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications, which is her personal preference. They've been together three years, and nothing changed until now. The boyfriend wants to get small gauges as a gesture for his friend's sobriety. The girlfriend objects, calling it trashy and linking it to her sister's exes. The boyfriend is upset and accuses her of being controlling.\n\nSo, the author is asking if she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate. \n\nKey factors here: personal preferences vs. the boyfriend's autonomy. She expressed her dislike early on, so he knew her stance. But he's now making a personal choice, possibly for a friend's reason. Is it fair for her to expect him to conform to her preferences, or is he within his rights to make his own choice even if it upsets her?\n\nBody modifications are personal. Unless there's a mutual agreement about such things, it's his body. However, since they've been in a long-term relationship, maybe there's an unspoken boundary she expected him to respect. But when he knew her views and still chose to proceed, that could be seen as his right. \n\nThe girlfriend is using the relationship as a reason to pressure him, which might not be fair. He might feel that his autonomy is being dismissed. On the other hand, if she's made it clear and he goes against it, maybe she has a right to be upset, but it's not necessarily her fault. \n\nThe friend's sobriety is a personal reason for the boyfriend. It's his choice to support his friend in this way. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her personal dislike, not a moral or health issue. So, her objection is subjective. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's choices is important. If she can't accept his decision despite knowing her views, maybe there's a compatibility issue. But is she in the wrong for expressing her dislike? Not necessarily. However, if she's using the relationship to control his choices, that's different. \n\nThe boyfriend got mad and called her controlling. That's a strong accusation. If she's not trying to control but express her feelings, then the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top. But she's also saying she's considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes. That's a significant consequence. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's not forcing him but expressing her discomfort, she's not wrong. But if she's pressuring him or trying to control him, maybe. The question is whether her objection is valid. Since it's a personal preference and he's making his own choice, it's his body. She's not in the wrong for having the preference, but the boyfriend is within his rights to proceed. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author's personal feelings are valid, and the boyfriend should respect her by discussing it, but ultimately, the decision is his. The conflict arises from differing priorities in the relationship. The author isn't wrong for expressing her dislike, but the boyfriend's reaction of anger and calling her controlling suggests a deeper issue. However, the question is about who is in the wrong here. The author isn't wrong for having her preference, so B is the answer.\n"
