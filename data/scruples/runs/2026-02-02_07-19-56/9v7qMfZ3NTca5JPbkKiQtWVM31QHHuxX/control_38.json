When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author made her feelings clear from the start. She mentioned she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. That's her personal opinion, and she communicated it when they met. Now, after three years, her boyfriend wants to get gauges as a show of solidarity with a friend who's sober. He's doing it to support his friend, which seems like a positive reason.\n\nThe boyfriend got mad and called her controlling. Is that fair? She had expressed her dislike beforehand, so she's not suddenly opposing something she was okay with. But she's not saying he can't do it at all; she's expressing her personal dislike. However, in a relationship, you also have to respect each other's choices. Maybe she's overstepping by making a big deal about something he wants to do for a friend, especially since she acknowledged that others like mods. \n\nOn the other hand, he knew her feelings and still went ahead, which could be seen as dismissive. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. She's expressing her opinion, which is valid. But if she's using her disapproval to pressure or control him, that's different. The fact that he felt it was a big deal enough to consider breaking up over might indicate that she crossed a line, even if she's sharing her genuine feelings. \n\nAlternatively, he should be able to make his own decisions about his body, even if it goes against her preferences. The key here is whether she's being controlling or just expressing her opinion. Since she made her stance clear and he's going against it, maybe he's being unreasonable. But the argument is whether her opposition is controlling. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. However, since she's not forcing him to do anything and he's choosing to go against her preference for his own reasons, maybe she isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be overblown. So the answer could be B (No).\n"
