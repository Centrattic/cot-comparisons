When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting to get gauges, which the author doesn't like because she finds them trashy. She made her feelings clear from the start. Now, he wants to get them as a gesture for his friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author expressed her dislike from the beginning, which is important. She's not forcing him not to do it, but she's clearly communicating her personal opinion. On the other hand, the boyfriend is choosing to get the gauges despite her feelings, which he interprets as her being controlling. That's a conflict point.\n\nThe key factors here might be communication and mutual respect. The author communicated her stance early on, so the boyfriend should ideally respect that. However, he's making a personal choice that affects their relationship. The boyfriend's reaction of getting angry and calling her controlling suggests he might feel his autonomy is being challenged. \n\nBut the author isn't preventing him from getting the gauges; she's just expressing her dislike. So, is she in the wrong? Well, if he knew her feelings and still chose to go ahead, maybe he's not respecting her feelings. However, the author might be overstepping if she's trying to control his body. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for expressing her feelings.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reason is about solidarity with a friend, which could be a valid personal choice. The author's reasoning is based on her personal dislike, not something harmful. The boyfriend might need to consider if the gesture is worth the conflict. \n\nIn relationships, both people have to navigate each other's boundaries. The author made her feelings clear, so if the boyfriend proceeds, he's choosing to prioritize his friend's gesture over her feelings. That could be seen as disrespectful. But the author isn't stopping him, just voicing her opinion. So maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling might be the issue. If he's upset because she didn't force him but just expressed her opinion, maybe his reaction is disproportionate. However, the author is now considering ending the relationship, which indicates the issue is significant to her. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because she communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend is choosing to proceed, which is his right, but his reaction is problematic. The author isn't controlling; she's expressing her preferences. The boyfriend's decision to go ahead despite her feelings might be the issue here, but the author isn't wrong for having a different opinion.\n"
