When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when she told her boyfriend not to get gauges. The boyfriend got mad and called her controlling. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe key points here: They've been dating for three years. The author made it clear she doesn't like body modifications, considering them trashy. The boyfriend wants to get gauges to show solidarity with a friend who's sober. The author is upset because she thinks it's trashy and reminds her of her sister's exes. The boyfriend argues that she's being controlling.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Body modification is a personal choice. The boyfriend is using it as a way to support his friend, which is his own decision. The author had previously expressed her dislike, but the boyfriend is now making a personal choice that she doesn't agree with. The question is about whether she has the right to ask him not to do it.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy. Even if one partner has preferences, pushing the other to conform can be controlling. The author is asking him to avoid a choice he wants to make for himself, based on her personal feelings. However, she's not forcing him; she's expressing her dislike. But if he's making the choice regardless, she might be feeling disrespected, but maybe she shouldn't control his decisions about his own body.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction being anger and calling her controlling suggests he felt her request was an overreach. The author might not be in the wrong if she's just expressing her opinion and not forcing him. But if she's making it a deal-breaker without considering his reasons, that could be where the issue is. The fact that he's doing it for a friend's support and not for body modification itself might be a valid reason for him.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but the boyfriend's right to make his own choices about his body. However, depending on the context of their communication, if she's being overly controlling, maybe. But based on the info given, she's not forcing him, just sharing her dislike. He's choosing to go against her preference for his own reasons. She's within her rights to have her opinion, and the boyfriend is in his right to make that choice. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
