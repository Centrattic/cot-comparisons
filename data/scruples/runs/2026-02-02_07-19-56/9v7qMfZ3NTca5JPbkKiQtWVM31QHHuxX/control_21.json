When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that they've been dating for three years, and she made it clear she doesn't like body mods. Now he wants to get gauges for a friend's solidarity, and he's upset, calling her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author communicated her dislike for body mods from the start. That's important because boundaries are key in relationships. She's not asking him to change who he is, just this specific action. But he's now wanting to do something that goes against her feelings, even though he knew her stance beforehand.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend is also within his rights to want to express himself, especially for a friend's milestone. The conflict here is about personal choice versus respecting the partner's feelings. The author is not trying to control him, but her feelings are valid. On the other hand, him getting angry and labeling her as controlling might be an overreaction. \n\nThe key points: the author had communicated her preferences upfront, and the boyfriend is moving forward despite that. The author is not forcing him to do anything, just expressing her discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction might be the issue here\u2014disrespecting her feelings and using the controlling label could be where he's wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The boyfriend is the one acting against her wishes by proceeding with the gauges. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
