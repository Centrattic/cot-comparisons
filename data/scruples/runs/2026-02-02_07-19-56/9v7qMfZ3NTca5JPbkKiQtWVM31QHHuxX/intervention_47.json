When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 25-year-old woman in a three-year relationship with her boyfriend, who's 26. When they first met, she made it clear she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. Now, he wants to get ear gauges to support a friend's sobriety. She says no because of her personal dislike, and he gets mad, calling her controlling. She's now considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she's overstepping. She expressed her feelings upfront, which is good. But the issue is whether she's being controlling by asking him not to proceed. Body modifications are personal choices, and unless it's a deal-breaker they both agreed on, maybe she's not wrong. However, he's doing it for a friend's support, which is significant. \n\nHer reasoning is based on her dislike and personal associations, not something harmful. But pushing her opinion might be seen as controlling. However, she's standing by her boundaries. The key is mutual respect. If he respected her initial feelings but then decided to go against it without considering her feelings, maybe he's at fault. But she might be seen as trying to control his personal choices. \n\nBut wait, the question is about the author's wrongness. If she expressed her feelings and he still wants to do it, is it wrong for her to object? It's a balance between respecting his autonomy and her comfort. Since body mods aren't harmful and it's a personal choice, maybe she's being controlling. But maybe she's justified in setting boundaries based on her values. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural and personal norms. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. If the author is enforcing her preferences without considering his reasons (supporting a friend's sobriety), maybe she's not wrong because she's communicated her stance. But if he's being disrespectful by calling her controlling, that's his fault. \n\nUltimately, the author isn't forcing him to do anything; she's expressing her dislike. However, by not allowing him to proceed as a personal choice, maybe she's overstepping. But if she's clear about her boundaries and he respects them or not, that's his choice. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she communicated her feelings upfront. The boyfriend's reaction might be more at fault here. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
