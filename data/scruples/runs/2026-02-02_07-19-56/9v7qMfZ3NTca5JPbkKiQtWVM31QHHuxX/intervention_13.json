When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to get gauges. The boyfriend has no body mods and the author made it clear she doesn't like them. Now he wants to get gauges as a gesture for his friend's sobriety. The author is upset because it reminds her of her sister's exes and calls it trashy. The boyfriend got mad and accused her of being controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author communicated her dislike for body mods early on, which is fair. It's important to have boundaries in a relationship. But then the boyfriend decides to go against that boundary. He says it's for solidarity with his friend. Is that a valid reason? On one hand, supporting a friend's sobriety is a positive act. But on the other, respecting the partner's established boundaries is also important.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author had made her stance clear from the beginning, so the boyfriend should have considered her feelings. However, he might feel that his friend's milestones are important and that the author is overstepping. The issue arises when one partner doesn't respect the other's boundaries. The author isn't controlling if she's been clear and the boyfriend is making a choice that affects their relationship. But the boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling suggests he feels his autonomy is being restricted.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to find a balance between their individual desires and the relationship's health. If the author has consistently communicated her dislike and the boyfriend is still pushing for this, it might indicate a lack of respect for her feelings. The author's concern about the gauges making her think of \"scumbag\" types is a personal feeling, but it's valid for her to express. However, the boyfriend's autonomy is also a factor here. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong if she's been honest from the start, but the boyfriend's decision to proceed despite her feelings shows a lack of consideration. The main issue is whether respecting personal boundaries outweighs individual autonomy. Since the author has communicated her stance and the boyfriend is choosing to disregard it, it's more about his response than her being controlling. So, the author is not in the wrong, making the answer B.\n"
