When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating three years, and he's never done anything like this before. Now, he wants to get gauges to celebrate his friend's sobriety, but she's against it, which leads to conflict.\n\nThe author argues that she's communicated her dislike of body mods from the beginning. She's not trying to control him, just expressing her personal opinion. The boyfriend, however, feels she's being controlling, which is causing him to get angry. He's using the reason of supporting his friend's sobriety, which might be a personal and meaningful choice for him.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, she's stating her boundaries and preferences. In a relationship, it's normal to have discussions about personal choices that affect both partners. However, the boyfriend might feel that his autonomy is being restricted. The issue here is whether her disapproval is a valid reason for him to feel controlled. \n\nShe didn't ask him to stop having friends or not support his friend's decision. She just expressed her dislike of body mods. But he's choosing to get gauges specifically because of his friend's sobriety, which he finds meaningful. If he feels that his meaningful choice is being dismissed, he might see it as controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing him to do anything; she's just expressing her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top if he didn't consider her perspective. But if he feels that his autonomy is being violated by her disapproval, that's a problem. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's values and boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for having her own preferences. However, the boyfriend's decision to get gauges might be a personal choice that he feels is important, and if she's uncomfortable with that, it's a conflict they need to resolve together. \n\nBut the question is whether she is in the wrong. Since she made her stance clear from the start and he's now choosing to go against that, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if he feels her disapproval is controlling, that's a valid concern. It's a bit of a gray area. But given that she communicated her feelings and he's now making a choice that she dislikes, maybe she's not the one at fault here. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's expressing her preferences that she's had from the start. The boyfriend's reaction could be his own overstepping, expecting her to accept something she's never been okay with. However, if she's trying to influence his decision beyond her own comfort, that's where it could tip into controlling behavior. But since she's just expressing her dislike without forcing him to not do it, she's probably not in the wrong.\n"
