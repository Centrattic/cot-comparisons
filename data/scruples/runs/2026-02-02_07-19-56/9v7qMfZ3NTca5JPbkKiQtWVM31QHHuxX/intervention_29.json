When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that she's been clear for three years that she doesn't like body modifications, considering them trashy. Now her boyfriend wants to get small gauges to celebrate his friend's sobriety. He got mad, called her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes even though he knew her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author made her preferences known early on. That's important because in a relationship, communication is key. He knew she didn't like body mods, yet he wants to do something that goes against that. But he's doing it for a friend's sobriety, which is a positive intention. However, she feels it's trashy and it reminds her of negative associations from her sister's past. \n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's expressing her discomfort and has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. On the other, maybe her reaction is over the top if she's being controlling. But wait, he's the one wanting to do something she's against. So she asked him not to, which is her boundary. He got mad and called her controlling, which might be his own issue with her boundaries. \n\nBut the key point is whether her asking him not to get gauges is controlling. If he's aware of her feelings and still chooses to go ahead, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. However, he's also entitled to his choices unless they directly harm her. But in this case, it's his body, so he has autonomy. The conflict arises because her feelings are hurt, but does that make her right to demand he not do it?\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is essential. If he's willing to go against her wishes despite knowing her feelings, maybe that's a problem. But if he's standing by his decision, she might need to accept that. However, if she's consistently communicated her dislike and feels it affects their relationship, then maybe she's justified in her feelings. The fact that he's getting it for a friend's solidarity adds another layer. She might be overreacting if it's not a big deal, but if it's a dealbreaker for her, then she's in a tough spot.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her request is reasonable. If she's not physically or emotionally harming him, but just expressing her dislike, then he might be overreacting by calling her controlling. However, he has the right to his own body modifications. But if she's using her disapproval to manipulate or pressure him, that's different. Here, she's stating her feelings without forcing him into a situation. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's trying to control his choices, then she is. The line between expressing preferences and controlling behavior is thin here.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong because she communicated her feelings and is setting boundaries. Her boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling might be an overreaction. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
