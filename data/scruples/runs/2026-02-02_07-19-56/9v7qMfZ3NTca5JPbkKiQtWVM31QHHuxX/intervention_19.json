When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a woman) is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to get gauges. The boyfriend wants to get them as a show of solidarity for his friend who's sober. The boyfriend got angry and called her controlling. The author is confused and considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author made her dislike for body modifications clear from the start. She thinks they're trashy and associate them with negative people from her sister's past. The boyfriend, on the other hand, wants to do it for his friend's sobriety, which is a positive reason. He argues that she's being controlling. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author communicated her feelings upfront, which is good. The boyfriend, however, went ahead despite her objection. That's where the conflict lies. But is it about control or differing values? The boyfriend might feel his autonomy is being restricted, while the author feels her boundaries aren't respected. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The author might not have considered alternative ways for the boyfriend to support his friend without getting gauges. Maybe there's a middle ground. But the boyfriend's reaction was anger, which is unhealthy. However, the author's stance is based on her personal feelings, which are valid. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she communicated her feelings and the boyfriend still chose to proceed, that's a breach of mutual respect. But if she's not being flexible, maybe she's being too rigid. However, the boyfriend's reaction being anger is a red flag. It's a balance between respecting each other's boundaries and finding solutions that work for both. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but maybe she could explore compromises. Still, the boyfriend's actions and reaction might indicate deeper issues. \n\nHmm, I think the answer hinges on whether the boyfriend had a valid reason and if the author's opposition was absolute. Since the boyfriend's reason is positive (supporting a friend's sobriety), but the author's feelings are personal, maybe the author isn't in the wrong but could benefit from discussing alternatives. However, since the boyfriend went against her wishes and got angry, the issue might be more about his behavior than her stance. But the question is about her being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend's reaction was inappropriate. The problem is more about his lack of respect for her boundaries than her stance on gauges.\n"
