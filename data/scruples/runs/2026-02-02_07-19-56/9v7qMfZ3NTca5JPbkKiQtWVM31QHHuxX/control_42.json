When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend wants to get gauges, which the girl doesn't like because she finds them trashy and associates them with scumbag types. They've been dating three years and she made her feelings clear from the start. Now he wants to get them for a friend's solidarity, but she says no, and he gets mad, calling her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. The girl mentioned her dislike of body mods when they first met, so the boyfriend should have been aware of her stance. However, he's still going ahead with the gauges, which might be a problem. But why now? The reason he gives is solidarity with a friend who's sober. It's a personal choice for him, but does that override the partner's feelings?\n\nOn one hand, expressing personal preferences is valid. If she made it clear she doesn't like it, the boyfriend should respect that. If he goes against her wishes, maybe he's being inconsiderate. But on the other hand, he's making a decision about his own body. Shouldn't he have the right to do that even if it upsets her? \n\nThe girl's reaction is about her feelings. She's not forbidding him from doing it physically, but she's expressing her dislike. The boyfriend taking it as controlling might be an overreaction. If he really values the relationship, he might need to find a compromise. However, the girl is now considering ending the relationship over this, which could be too harsh if he's just following through with a choice he felt was important for himself.\n\nSo, who's at fault? The girl had her feelings communicated, but maybe she shouldn't be so rigid. The boyfriend, while having a reason, might not have considered her feelings enough. But since she already made her stance clear, he should have known the potential issue. However, he's also within his rights to make his own decisions. Maybe both have some responsibility here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is being unreasonable by not respecting her feelings, then she's not wrong. But if his choice is his own and she's being too controlling, then she might be. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the key is that she communicated her feelings, and he chose to go against them despite knowing. That could mean she's not in the wrong because she expressed her stance, and he's not respecting her boundaries. But maybe the boyfriend is just asserting his autonomy. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she's standing by her preferences that she communicated early on, and the boyfriend is now acting out of those preferences after three years. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
