When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that she made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications, and now her boyfriend wants to get gauges as a gesture for his friend. He's upset and called her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman communicated her dislike of body mods early on, and the boyfriend knew this. He's now going against her wishes, which she sees as a betrayal. On the other hand, the boyfriend is making a personal choice to support his friend, which he feels is important.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. If she communicated her boundaries and he still proceeds, that might be a problem. However, his choice is also a personal one. But she's upset because he's disregarding her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling might be an overreaction. \n\nBut depending on the context, if she's not forcing him to not get them, just expressing her dislike, then maybe she's not wrong. However, she also mentions that she might not want to be in the relationship anymore because of this. That suggests a breakdown in communication or compromise.\n\nBut the main issue is whether she is in the wrong. If the boyfriend knew her stance and chose to ignore it, maybe she's not wrong. However, if the boyfriend is entitled to his own choices despite her feelings, perhaps the issue is about how she's reacting. However, the key is that she made her feelings clear, and he's choosing to go against that. In a healthy relationship, both should respect each other's boundaries. If he's not respecting her feelings, that's a problem. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to check if there's a point where personal freedom vs. partner's preferences. Body modifications are a personal choice, and unless it's something that affects the relationship directly (like in a polyamorous context), it's a personal decision. However, if she's expressing her discomfort and he's choosing to proceed, it's a conflict. The question is whether she has the right to ask him not to do it. Since she's not forcing him, but expressing her feelings, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend is making his choice despite her feelings, so he might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
