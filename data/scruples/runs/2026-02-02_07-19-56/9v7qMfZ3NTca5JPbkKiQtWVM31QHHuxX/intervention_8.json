When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get gauges in his ears. The author, a woman, made it clear when they met that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. Now, after three years, the boyfriend wants to get gauges for a friend's sobriety celebration. She objects, and he gets mad, calling her controlling. She's unsure about continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author communicated her feelings early on about body mods. The boyfriend knew this when they started dating. But he's now moving forward with a decision that she's clearly against, even if it's for a friend. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that he should have the freedom to make his own choices, especially since the author made her stance known a long time ago, and he might feel that his friend's celebration is important to him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author made her preferences known, which is her right. However, the boyfriend might argue that he's entitled to his own choices, even if they conflict with her preferences. The argument here is about boundaries in a relationship. If the boyfriend agreed to the terms set by the author when they started dating, does he overstep by pursuing something she dislikes? Or is it about his autonomy?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that body mods remind her of people she dislikes, but she acknowledges it's a personal feeling. The boyfriend might feel that his decision to get gauges is his own, even if it's something the author finds unappealing. However, he's also using a friend's sobriety as a reason, which could be a valid personal motivation. The conflict arises because the author is now objecting after a long period where it wasn't an issue before. Maybe the boyfriend felt that after three years, his personal freedom takes precedence over her initial reservations.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was clear from the start, the boyfriend should have considered that. But relationships involve compromise. If the author is now changing her stance or the situation has evolved, the boyfriend might feel it's time to assert his own preferences. The fact that he got mad and called her controlling could indicate that he feels she's overstepping, even if she communicated her preferences early on. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for objecting now. Since she made her stance clear, she's not necessarily wrong for having those feelings. However, if the boyfriend's decision is a personal choice and not harmful to her, maybe the author is being controlling. Alternatively, if the author's feelings are a deal-breaker for her, then it's a valid reason to reconsider the relationship.\n\nIn AITA posts, often the key is whether the person acted respectfully and communicated effectively. The author did communicate her feelings, but if the boyfriend's action is a personal choice that doesn't directly harm her, the author might be in the wrong for trying to control his decisions. However, if the boyfriend knew her stance and is choosing to go against it despite the potential for conflict, he might be in the wrong too. The answer might be that both have some responsibility, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since she expressed her views early on, but the boyfriend is asserting his independence, the author might not be in the wrong if she's following through on her established boundaries. However, if the boyfriend's action is a personal choice that the author is now trying to control after three years, maybe she is in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer could be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she communicated her boundaries from the start, and the boyfriend is choosing to ignore them, which could be seen as the issue. But some might argue that after three years, he should have the autonomy. Hmm.\n"
