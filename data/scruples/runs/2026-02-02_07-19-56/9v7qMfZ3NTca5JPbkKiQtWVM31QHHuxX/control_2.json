When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting to get gauges, which the author dislikes. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend had no body mods when they met. The author made it clear she doesn't like body mods, thinking they're trashy. They've been together three years, and now he wants to get gauges as a solidarity gesture for a friend. The author objects, which makes him angry, calling her controlling. Now she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nI need to assess if the author is wrong. So, did she cross a boundary? She communicated her feelings upfront. He decided to do something she dislikes after three years. She's not forcing him; she's expressing her opinion. But he's arguing it's his choice. \n\nIs it controlling? If she's not restricting his autonomy but is hurt by the mods, maybe not. But if she's pressuring him to change his decision, that's different. The author isn't saying he can't do it but is expressing her dislike. He's mad she's not supportive. He might feel his autonomy is being challenged. \n\nBut he knew her stance when they started. Is it fair for him to proceed now? Maybe the issue is whether she's being respectful of his choice after three years. However, she's not in love with body mods and feels it's a deal-breaker. \n\nBody modification is a personal choice. If he's doing it for his friend's solidarity, it's his way to celebrate. The author's feelings are valid, but should that override his decision? It's a conflict of personal preferences. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is important. However, if one partner's preference is non-negotiable, it can cause conflict. The author isn't wrong for having her opinion, but the boyfriend might feel his autonomy is being disrespected. \n\nAlternatively, the boyfriend could have discussed it earlier, considering her feelings. But since he's doing it now, maybe the author is within her rights to express her disapproval. \n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for expressing her dislike and not wanting him to get gauges, given her prior communication? The answer would depend on whether her stance is controlling or just expressing her feelings. Since she's not forcing him, and he's choosing to proceed despite her feelings, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings after three years. \n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong if she's not respecting his autonomy. But the key is that she communicated her feelings, and he's choosing to go against that. Relationships require compromise. If this is a deal-breaker for her, then it's a problem for her, not necessarily her fault. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for having her opinion and expressing it. The boyfriend is in the wrong for getting angry and calling her controlling for standing by her values. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
