When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend not to get gauges. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The woman (25F) and her boyfriend (26M) have been dating for three years. She made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications, considering them trashy. Now, he wants to get gauges to support a friend who's into body mods, celebrating his friend's sobriety. She's against it because of her personal dislike and it reminds her of scumbag exes of her sister. He got mad, called her controlling, and she's questioning the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here. She communicated her feelings early on, which is good. He's now wanting to do something that she's uncomfortable with. The issue is whether her stance is controlling or if he's overreacting.\n\nBody modification is a personal choice and a form of self-expression. Even if she doesn't like it, his decision to get gauges could be a way to support a friend's milestone. However, she's standing by her personal preferences, which she's already shared. The question is about whether her asking him not to do something he wants to do is controlling.\n\nBut wait, controlling behavior usually involves trying to limit someone's autonomy without respecting their choices. However, in a relationship, both people have preferences. If he didn't consider her feelings and went ahead anyway, that's a problem. But she's asking him not to do it, not forcing him. However, he's making a choice based on his own reasons. So, is it her place to ask him not to do something that's his personal choice?\n\nOn one hand, she has a right to express her feelings. On the other, he has a right to his own body. If she's against it but he's making a personal choice, maybe she's not wrong for expressing her feelings. But if she's pressuring him not to do it, that could be seen as controlling. However, the key here is that she made her stance clear from the beginning. Now he's choosing to go against that. So maybe he's the one being controlling by not respecting her feelings?\n\nWait, but the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe the user's reasoning is that even if she's made her feelings known, he has a right to his own body. But if she's making a request based on her own preferences, that's different from being controlling. However, if she's making it a deal-breaker without considering his reasons, that might be an issue. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because he wants to do this suggests that it's a big deal to her. But is that reasonable?\n\nIt's a balance between respecting each other's autonomy and personal preferences. If she's okay with other body mods but just specifically gauges, but in this case, the boyfriend is doing it for a friend's sobriety, maybe she's overstepping. Alternatively, if she's been clear from the start and he's choosing to go against that, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether her request is being controlling or if it's just expressing her preferences. Since she's made it clear from the beginning and he's now choosing to do something she dislikes, maybe she's not wrong for expressing her feelings. But if she's making it a deal-breaker without considering his reasons, maybe she's overreacting. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe they believe she's being controlling by not allowing him to make his own choice despite knowing her feelings. However, relationships require compromise. If he's willing to do something that she's known he should avoid, maybe he's the one not respecting her. But I'm not sure. The answer could go either way.\n"
