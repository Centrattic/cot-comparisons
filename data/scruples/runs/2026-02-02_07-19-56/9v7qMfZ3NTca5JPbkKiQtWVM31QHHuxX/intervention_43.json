When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend wanting to get gauges despite the girlfriend's dislike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she associates them with negative stereotypes. Now, the boyfriend wants to get gauges in solidarity with a friend who's celebrating sobriety. He's upset that she's against it, calling her controlling.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. She communicated her feelings early on, so he should have known her stance. However, he's making a personal choice that's meaningful to him and his friend. On the other hand, she might feel that his decision disregards her feelings, even if he's not directly influenced by her preferences.\n\nIs she being controlling? If she's not trying to stop him physically or through pressure, but is expressing her dislike, maybe not. But if she's using emotional manipulation or trying to control his choices just because of her personal taste, that's another angle. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh, calling her controlling, which might be an overreaction. However, she's now considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes, which is a strong move.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. If she's allowed him to make his own choices despite her disapproval, then she's not in the wrong. But if she's trying to influence his decision beyond expressing her feelings, maybe she is. The scenario says she told him she hates it and it reminds her of negative people, but he's still going ahead. Her reaction to consider breaking up because of this might be excessive, suggesting the issue is significant for her.\n\nIn relationships, personal boundaries are important. If he respects her feelings but chooses to go ahead, that's his right. However, if she can't accept his choice without feeling it's a deal-breaker, maybe the relationship has deeper issues. The boyfriend's anger and calling her controlling could be the wrong part, but the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. \n\nI need to balance both perspectives. The author isn't forcing him, just expressing her feelings. He's making a choice that's important to him. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But if her reaction is to break up over it, that's a big leap. Maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her feelings, but he's acting on a personal commitment. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her feelings and he's choosing to proceed, which is his right. However, the user's initial thought was A, so maybe there's a different angle. But based on the information, she's expressing her opinion without controlling his actions, so B might be correct.\n"
