When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend (26M) wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who's into body mods. The author (25F) made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating three years, and now he wants to get the gauges. She told him she hates it, comparing it to people her sister used to date, and he got mad, calling her controlling. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication and boundaries. From the start, she made her feelings clear. So he knew her stance on body mods. Now he's choosing to get one that she's against. But why is he doing it? He says it's for a friend's sobriety celebration. That's a personal choice for him, maybe to show support. But does her disapproval make her controlling?\n\nOn the other hand, she's expressing her personal dislike. It's her opinion, but he might feel his right to make a personal choice is being infringed. The fact that she mentioned it reminds her of scumbags might be an unfair generalization, but it's her perception. However, he knew this and decided to proceed anyway, which could be seen as disregarding her feelings.\n\nBut in a relationship, both people have to respect each other's boundaries. If she made it clear and he still goes against her wishes, maybe that's disrespectful. However, if he has a valid reason (supporting a friend's sobriety), maybe he's within his right to do it. Yet, the key point is that he knew her stance. If he values the relationship, he might need to discuss it more carefully instead of just going ahead.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong because she communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend should have considered that. But maybe she's being too controlling? Or is it his choice? It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say he should have more autonomy, but since it's something she's clear about, he should respect that. The fact that he called her controlling might be the issue here. If he respects her enough, he'd find another way to support his friend without making her uncomfortable. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
