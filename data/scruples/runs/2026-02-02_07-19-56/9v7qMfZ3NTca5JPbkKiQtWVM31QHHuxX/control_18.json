When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's acceptable for the boyfriend to get gauges despite the girlfriend's expressed dislike.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating for three years, and nothing changed until now. The boyfriend wants to get gauges as a way to support his friend who's sober. The girlfriend is upset and feels the boyfriend is being controlling. The boyfriend is upset because he thinks she's controlling.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the girlfriend is being controlling by asking him not to get gauges. On one hand, she made her feelings clear, and he had known this for three years. On the other hand, he wants to do this for his friend, which is a personal choice. \n\nBut in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend expressed her dislike, and the boyfriend decided to go against that, which makes her feel her preferences aren't respected. However, body modifications are a personal choice, and the boyfriend might feel his autonomy is being restricted. \n\nThe line between expressing a preference and being controlling can be thin. If she's asking him not to do it for her own reasons, but he's making a choice based on his own motivations, there's a conflict. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling suggests he feels she's overstepping. \n\nBut considering that she made her stance clear from the beginning, and he's now choosing to go against that, maybe she's justified in feeling hurt. However, if he's making a choice that affects his own body and not something that directly impacts her, maybe she is being controlling. \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect. If she respects his choice, but he respects her feelings. But since she's asking him not to do it, even though he has his own reasons, it's a conflict. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, people should have autonomy over their bodies. However, in a relationship, communication is key. Maybe she should have discussed it more, but she did express her feelings. \n\nHmm, I'm torn. On one side, she's not in the wrong for expressing her dislike, but if she's pressuring him not to do it, that could be controlling. But if he knew from the start and is choosing to go against that, maybe she's not wrong. Wait, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's just stating her feelings and he's choosing to do it anyway, then she's not wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of getting mad and calling her controlling might be the issue. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
