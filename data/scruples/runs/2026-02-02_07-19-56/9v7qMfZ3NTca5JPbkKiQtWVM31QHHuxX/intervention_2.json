When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting to get gauges, which the author (a woman) dislikes because she finds them trashy and associates them with negative memories. The boyfriend got upset, called her controlling, and now she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications. She's been consistent for three years. Now her boyfriend wants to get gauges for a friend's sobriety celebration. She tells him she hates the idea, and he's upset, saying she's being controlling. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication and compromise. She communicated her dislike early on, and he's choosing to go against her wishes. But is that okay? On the other hand, he's doing it for a friend's milestone, which might be meaningful to him. But does that justify going against her comfort level, especially since she made it clear from the beginning?\n\nBody modifications are personal choices. However, in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual respect. If he knew her feelings and still chose to proceed, maybe that's inconsiderate. But then again, he might feel his own autonomy is being restricted. The line between respecting her feelings and being controlling is blurry here. \n\nThe author could argue that she's standing by her boundaries. He could argue that she's being too restrictive. Maybe the issue is about whether personal expression trumps the partner's discomfort. But in a long-term relationship, partners often make compromises. If she's unwilling to accept something he wants to do, even if it's not harmful, that could be seen as controlling. \n\nAlternatively, since she made her feelings known upfront and he's only now wanting to do this, maybe it's fair for her to express her dislike again. However, if he's decided to proceed despite her opposition, he might be overstepping by calling her controlling. \n\nI think the crux is whether his actions are a reasonable self-expression or if he's disregarding her feelings. If the gauges are a significant change for him and he's doing it for a meaningful reason, that's different from just following a trend. But the author's discomfort is valid too. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, maybe it's a middle ground. However, since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. If the boyfriend is respecting her by discussing it and she's still not okay, maybe he should proceed if he's comfortable. But if the author feels it's a deal-breaker, then maybe she's not wrong. \n\nWait, but the boyfriend is getting upset and calling her controlling. That could be his issue. If she's not forcing him to get the gauges but expressing her dislike, and he's taking it as control, that's on him. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nHmm, I'm a bit torn. But considering that she communicated her feelings, and he's choosing to do something she dislikes, but she's not physically stopping him, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if she's pressuring him not to do it beyond expressing her opinion, then she might be. The situation is a bit ambiguous. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's standing by her boundaries she set from the beginning. The boyfriend is making a personal choice despite her feelings, which is his right, but his reaction of anger and calling her controlling is his fault. So she's not wrong for expressing her feelings, but he's handling it poorly. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
