When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 25-year-old woman) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that both she and her boyfriend currently have no body modifications. She made it clear when they met that she doesn't like body mods because she thinks they're trashy. Now, after three years, the boyfriend wants to get gauges as a gesture for his friend's sobriety. The author is upset, and the boyfriend is angry, calling her controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy in relationships. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author has expressed her dislike for body mods, so the boyfriend should be aware of that. However, the boyfriend is making a personal choice to get gauges for a meaningful reason (supporting a friend's sobriety). The key here is whether her objection is about her personal preferences interfering with his autonomy.\n\nBut wait, she made her stance clear from the start. If the boyfriend knew and still chose to proceed, maybe he's asserting his own autonomy. However, the problem is whether her objection is reasonable. She's not physically preventing him, just expressing her dislike. But if she's using emotional pressure (making him feel bad) or if he feels controlled, that's an issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction of being angry and calling her controlling suggests he feels his autonomy is being infringed. The author is asking if this is a deal-breaker for her. The question is whether her stance is valid. She's not forbidding him, just expressing her dislike. But maybe she's overstepping by making a decision about his body. Body modifications are personal choices, and unless there's a mutual agreement on boundaries, one partner shouldn't dictate the other's choices. So the author might be in the wrong by not respecting his autonomy, even if it's based on her personal preferences. Alternatively, if she made her preferences known and he chose to go against them, maybe she's justified in feeling hurt or considering the relationship's future. But the core issue is about personal autonomy versus personal preferences. So if the boyfriend is making a decision about his own body, the author shouldn't control that. Hence, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but wait, the initial response thought she might be in the wrong. Wait, need to clarify.\n\nAnother angle: In relationships, mutual respect is key. The author expressed her feelings upfront, which is good. The boyfriend, knowing her feelings, still proceeds. But if he's making a meaningful decision (supporting a friend's sobriety), maybe she's being controlling. However, the boyfriend's anger at her objection is also a red flag. He shouldn't be angry if he's making a personal choice. The author's right to have her preferences is valid, but if she's making a big deal about it and possibly pressuring him not to do it, that could be controlling. The line between expressing a preference and being controlling is thin. If she's not trying to stop him but is expressing her dislike, it's okay. If she's pressuring him or making him feel bad, that's another issue. The boyfriend's reaction suggests he feels controlled, which could be valid if she's being too forceful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's just expressing her feelings without coercion, perhaps not. However, if the boyfriend is making a personal choice and she's not respecting that, maybe she is. But in this case, the boyfriend is making a choice that the author dislikes. So depending on how she's communicating it. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to see which way it goes. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's expressing her feelings she made clear, and if the boyfriend proceeds, it's his choice. However, the boyfriend's reaction of anger and calling her controlling might indicate he's being unreasonable. So the author isn't wrong for having her opinion and communicating it. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
