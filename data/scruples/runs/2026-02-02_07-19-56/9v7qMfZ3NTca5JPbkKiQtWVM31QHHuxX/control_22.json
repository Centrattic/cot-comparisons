When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 25-year-old woman) is in the wrong for telling her boyfriend (26-year-old man) not to get gauges. They've been dating three years, and she made it clear she doesn't like body modifications because they seem trashy, even though she acknowledges others like them. Now he wants to get gauges to support his friend who's sober. He's upset, called her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. She communicated her feelings from the start, which is important. He knew her stance but still wants to proceed. The key here is whether her asking him not to get gauges is controlling or if it's reasonable given their history.\n\nConsent and autonomy are factors. He wants to make a personal choice for a friend. But she's uncomfortable with it. However, he's making a decision that affects his own body. She's not asking him to stop hanging out with his friend or not support him, just not get the gauges. But maybe there's a deeper issue of control if she's imposing her preferences on his body. Alternatively, if he's aware of her feelings and still chooses to go against them, that could be a red flag too.\n\nAnother angle: body autonomy. He has the right to modify his body as he sees fit. She can express her dislike, but if he's making the choice, she can't control him. However, if she's pressuring him or making him feel guilty, that's different. The problem here is that he's upset because he feels controlled. She might have overstepped by trying to influence his decision despite knowing his reasons.\n\nBut she's also standing by her boundaries. If he respects her boundaries, he might reconsider. But he's pushing back, which could indicate a conflict in their values. The bigger question is whether her expressing her discomfort is controlling. It's a line between expressing a preference and controlling behavior.\n\nIn relationships, partners should respect each other's choices unless it's harmful. Getting gauges is a personal choice. If she's not in favor, she can express that, but he has the right to make his own decision. Her making it a deal-breaker might be extreme, but his reaction might also be disproportionate if she had already communicated her stance.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's about whether her stance is controlling. If she's not forcing him but expressing her feelings, which he's aware of, then she's not wrong. But if she's trying to prevent him from making his own choice against his will, that's controlling. The key here is that he's making the choice, but she's not happy about it. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. The answer is B (No).\n"
