When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get gauges, and the girlfriend is against it because she finds them trashy. They've been dating for three years, and she made her stance clear from the start.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend expressed her dislike for body modifications, which he knew. Now, he wants to get gauges as a gesture for a friend's sobriety. She's upset and feels it reminds her of \"scumbag\" people from her sister's past. He got mad, called her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. In relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. She made her opinion clear, so he should have considered that. However, he's making a personal choice to support a friend, which is also valid. But does that justify going against her wishes?\n\nOn one hand, she's expressing her discomfort and setting a boundary. On the other hand, he's asserting his autonomy. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. She communicated her stance early on, so he should be aware. If he decided to go against it despite knowing her feelings, that could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries. However, if he believes his choice is important and they agreed to respect each other's decisions, then maybe it's a different angle.\n\nBut the girlfriend is now conflicted because he's pushing through. The issue is whether her disapproval is a valid reason for him to ignore her feelings. Since body modification is a personal choice, but he knew her stance, it's a conflict between personal freedom and respecting the partner's comfort. The line between controlling behavior and valid boundaries is thin here. If he respected her wishes, he wouldn't go through with it. If he feels it's a personal matter, he might proceed, but that could hurt her.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the boyfriend should have respected her boundary or if she overstepped. Since she made her feelings known and he's choosing to ignore them, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if he's making a choice that affects their relationship, that's on him. Alternatively, if she's pressuring him not to do something he wants to do for a friend, maybe she's being controlling. But the problem states that she communicated her dislike before, so he should have considered that.\n\nIn many cases, respecting a partner's boundaries is key. If the boyfriend disregards her known feelings, that's a problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because she set clear boundaries, and he's acting against them without considering her feelings. Thus, the answer would be B (No).\n"
