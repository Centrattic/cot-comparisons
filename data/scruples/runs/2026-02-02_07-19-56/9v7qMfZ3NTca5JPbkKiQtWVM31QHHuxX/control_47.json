When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the woman in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to get gauges. So, first, I need to consider the context they provided.\n\nThe woman made her stance clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy, associating them with negative experiences through her sister's exes. The boyfriend, who previously had no body mods, now wants to get gauges to support his friend who's celebrating sobriety. The boyfriend got angry, called her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are communication and boundaries. The woman communicated her feelings upfront, but the boyfriend proceeded anyway. However, the boyfriend's reason is about supporting a friend's milestone, which might be important to him. The question is whether her objection is valid or if she's overstepping.\n\nOn one hand, body modifications are a personal choice. Even if someone has a partner who dislikes them, the individual has the right to make their own decisions about their body. The boyfriend might feel that his autonomy is being restricted, especially if he's making a personal choice for a meaningful reason. If the woman is pressuring him not to get the gauges despite his reasons, that could be seen as controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, she expressed her feelings clearly. If she's uncomfortable with the prospect of her partner having body modifications, maybe she should have considered how her feelings might impact their relationship. However, the boyfriend also needs to respect her feelings. The fact that he got angry and called her controlling might indicate that he didn't take her feelings into account properly. But, the woman is also making a decision that affects her own comfort in the relationship.\n\nI need to think about whether her stance is about her own preferences or if she's trying to control his choices. Since she's stated her reasons (personal dislike, not a general aversion unless it's a deal-breaker), it's possible that she's within her rights to express her discomfort. However, if she's using that as a reason to end the relationship because he chooses to go against her wishes, that might complicate things.\n\nBut the boyfriend's actions are about his own body and a personal choice for a friend. If she's not okay with that, maybe the issue isn't who's \"in the wrong,\" but rather compatibility. However, the question is specifically whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of ethical standards, respecting personal autonomy is important. If she's not pressuring him beyond expressing her feelings and he's making the choice, then she's not in the wrong. However, if she's using emotional manipulation or trying to control him, then maybe she would be. But in this case, she just expressed her dislike, and he chose to proceed. So she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction might be the issue here, but the question is about the woman's actions.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B, she's not in the wrong. She communicated her feelings, and he chose to go against them. Her decision to reconsider the relationship might be a result of how he handled it, but her initial stance isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
