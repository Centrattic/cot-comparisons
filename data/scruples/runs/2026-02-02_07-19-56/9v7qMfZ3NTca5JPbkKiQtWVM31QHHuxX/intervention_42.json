When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that they've been dating for three years, and she made it clear she doesn't like body mods because she thinks they're trashy. Now, the boyfriend wants to get gauges as a gesture for his friend's sobriety. She told him she hates it and it reminds her of negative associations, leading him to feel controlled and getting angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is about her personal preferences and comfort. She's communicated this before, so the boyfriend might not have considered how it affects her. On the other hand, the boyfriend wants to support his friend, which is a personal choice and meaningful to him. The key here is consent and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should consider each other's feelings. However, the author is expressing her discomfort, which the boyfriend might dismiss by calling her controlling. But she's not preventing him from doing it entirely; she's expressing her dislike. The boyfriend's reaction might be an overreaction, but the author should also reflect on whether her stance is rigid. Maybe there's a middle ground, like choosing a different way to support his friend that doesn't involve gauges. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's being controlling, then yes. But if she's just sharing her feelings and he's taking it as a demand, then maybe he's being too sensitive. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because he's going to do it anyway shows a lack of compromise. However, the boyfriend's decision to prioritize his friend's gesture over her feelings could also be an issue. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she communicated her feelings beforehand. However, the boyfriend's anger and the potential for her to end the relationship due to this one issue might indicate deeper problems. The answer likely hinges on whether she's being controlling or just expressing her preferences. Since she's not forcing him but expressing her dislike, it's more about his reaction. So, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
