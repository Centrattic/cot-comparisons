When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a woman is asking if she's at fault for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. They've been together three years, and when they met, she made it clear she doesn't like body modifications, considering them trashy. Now, her boyfriend wants to get gauges as a show of solidarity with his sober friend. She's against it, he got mad, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been in a relationship for three years, and she had communicated her stance on body mods from the beginning. That's important because it's not like she just randomly brought this up out of nowhere. He was aware of her feelings. Now he wants to go ahead with something that she finds unappealing. But he's doing it for a friend's sobriety, which seems like a positive reason. \n\nBut then, is he respecting her feelings even though he's choosing to do it for a personal reason? If he knew she didn't like it, then going ahead without considering her feelings could be an issue. However, he might feel that his personal choice and his commitment to his friend's celebration is important. \n\nThe line between being considerate and being controlling is key here. The author might feel that her boundaries are being crossed, but her boyfriend might see it as his right to make personal choices. The fact that she's now considering the relationship is a big deal, which suggests that this is a significant issue for her.\n\nAnother angle: body modifications are a personal choice. If her boyfriend is within his right to make that choice, but she's uncomfortable, does that mean she's the one being controlling? Or is it about mutual respect? Since she had communicated her stance, but he's choosing to proceed, maybe there's a deeper issue of respecting each other's boundaries. \n\nAlso, the reason he's getting gauges is for a friend's sobriety. Is that a sufficient reason for her to be upset? Or is it about her own biases? The friend's sobriety is a positive thing, and the boyfriend is supporting a friend. So maybe the boyfriend is acting on a positive intention, which the author is conflicting with her own preferences.\n\nBut at the same time, if the boyfriend had considered her feelings and maybe had a discussion about how to support his friend in a way that doesn't make her uncomfortable, that's a different scenario. Instead, he went ahead without considering her feelings, even though she had made it clear. That might be where his fault lies. \n\nSo, the author communicated her feelings, the boyfriend chose to override that, leading to conflict. The author is not necessarily wrong for respecting her boundaries and not wanting her partner to do something that makes her uncomfortable, especially if she's communicated that. The boyfriend might be the one being inconsiderate here. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), because the author expressed her views, and the boyfriend disregarded her feelings. However, some might argue that personal autonomy is important, and the boyfriend is making a choice about his body. But since the author had communicated this before, the boyfriend should have considered her feelings more. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
