When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend (25F) asking her boyfriend (26M) not to get gauges. They've been dating for three years, and she made it clear from the start she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. Now he wants to get small gauges for a friend's sobriety, and he got angry, calling her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is clear about her preferences from the beginning. He knew her stance, yet he chose to go against it. But he's doing it for a friend's reason, which he might see as important. However, she's upset because it reminds her of negative associations. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. She set a clear boundary, and he's choosing to cross it despite her feelings. That could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. On the other hand, he might feel his autonomy is being restricted, especially if he sees it as a personal choice not to harm anyone. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she communicated her dislike clearly and he still goes ahead, she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings. However, if the relationship requires compromise on both sides, maybe there's a middle ground. But since he's getting upset and accusing her of being controlling, it's a conflict in values. \n\nBody modification is a personal choice, but in a relationship, partners should consider each other's comfort. She might not be wrong for respecting her own feelings, but she also might need to acknowledge his autonomy. However, since he knew her stance and chose to proceed, maybe she's justified in her reaction. The key here is whether setting a boundary is controlling. Controlling behavior would be if she's pressuring him to not get gauges beyond expressing her feelings. But in this case, she's just stating her dislike. \n\nSo the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong because she communicated her boundaries, and he's choosing to go against them. But there's a nuance here. If he's making a personal choice that affects their relationship dynamics, maybe there's a need for discussion. However, she's not wrong for having her opinion and expressing it, especially if it's a deal-breaker for her. The fact that he's getting angry and calling her controlling might indicate he's not respecting her feelings, so she's not the one at fault.\n"
