When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the woman (25F) made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them \"trashy.\" They've been dating for three years, and now the boyfriend (26M) wants to get gauges in his ears as a gesture of solidarity with a friend who's into body mods. The friend just became sober, and getting gauges is a way to celebrate.\n\nThe woman objects again, and the boyfriend gets angry, calling her controlling. Now she's considering leaving the relationship because he's going against her wishes even though he knew her stance beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman expressed her dislike early on, so the boyfriend knew. But body modifications are his own body, so he might feel his autonomy is being questioned. On the other hand, respecting each other's boundaries is important in a relationship. \n\nIs it controlling if she expresses her dislike? If she's not forcing him to do anything or trying to control his decisions, just expressing her opinion, then maybe not. But if she's making him feel that he can't do something he wants because of her, that could be an issue. However, she's not pressuring him to avoid the modifications, just stating her preference.\n\nThe boyfriend getting angry and calling her controlling might be a red flag. If he's respecting her feelings, he might try to find a compromise. But if he's doing this to assert his own choice, maybe he's overreacting. The woman is within her rights to have her opinion and express it. The boyfriend choosing to go ahead despite knowing her feelings could be seen as not respecting her boundaries, but he's also making a personal choice about his body.\n\nThe key here is whether the woman is trying to control his decisions or just expressing her feelings. If she's not trying to prevent him from getting gauges but is just stating her dislike, then she's not in the wrong. However, if she's pressuring him to not do it, that could be different. The way she phrased it seems like she's just expressing her opinion again. The boyfriend's reaction seems more controlling by labeling her as controlling and getting angry. \n\nSo, considering all that, the woman is not in the wrong for expressing her opinion, especially since she made her stance clear early on. The boyfriend's reaction might be more problematic. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
