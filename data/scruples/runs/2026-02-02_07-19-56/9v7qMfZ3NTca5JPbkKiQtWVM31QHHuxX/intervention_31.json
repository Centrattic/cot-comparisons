When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting her boyfriend to get gauges. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend mentioned he wants to get gauges as a show of solidarity with a friend who's celebrating sobriety. The girl had made it clear before that she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. Now the boyfriend is upset that she's against it, calling her controlling. She's considering breaking up because he's going against her wishes.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the girl overstepped or not. On one hand, she communicated her dislike upfront and has been consistent. On the other, changing your body is a personal choice. But since they're in a relationship, there's mutual respect to consider. However, if he's doing this for a friend's reason, maybe that's his personal choice to make. \n\nBut the girl's issue is with the perception of body mods, which she finds trashy. That's a bit judgmental, but it's her opinion. However, the boyfriend is now making her feel controlling. Where's the line here? If she's not forcing him to do anything, just expressing her dislike, but he's choosing to go against her wishes, is that a problem?\n\nI think the key points are communication and mutual respect. She expressed her feelings clearly, but he's making a choice that affects their relationship dynamics. However, body autonomy is important too. If he's doing it for a friend's sobriety, maybe that's a valid personal reason. She might be trying to control his decisions, which he perceives as controlling. \n\nBut then again, maybe she's not in the wrong. If they had a mutual agreement from the start, and he's now going against it, could that be a breach of trust? Or is it his body to modify regardless? \n\nHmm. The answer isn't straightforward. The girl's stance is about her personal preferences, but the boyfriend's action is about his personal choice. The fact that she's threatening to end the relationship over this might indicate that her feelings are strong, but does that make her wrong? \n\nMaybe the boyfriend is overreacting by calling her controlling, but he has a right to his own body. The girl's issue isn't about safety or health, just aesthetics. So, the boyfriend is within his rights to get the gauges, but the girl is within her rights to express her dislike. However, if the boyfriend is going against a clear boundary she set, maybe that's an issue. Wait, but the boundaries were set about her not liking body mods, not about him getting them. So, if he's choosing to do it despite her feelings, is he being disrespectful?\n\nI'm torn. On one hand, she's not forcing him to get rid of them, just expressing her dislike. On the other, he's choosing to proceed, which could hurt her feelings. Relationships require compromise. If she's not willing to accept his choice, and he's not willing to respect her feelings, that's a problem. But if she's not actually stopping him from getting them, just disapproving, maybe she isn't wrong. But if she made it a deal-breaker from the start, and he's now going against that, then she might be in the right to consider ending things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong for not considering her feelings, especially since she made them clear. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's not controlling but expressing her feelings and making her position clear, then she's not wrong. But if she's using the relationship to control his body choices, then she is. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her disapproval is a reasonable boundary or an attempt to control. Since she's not forcing him to stop but is making her feelings known, she's not wrong. However, if the boyfriend is aware and still choosing to proceed, he's not necessarily wrong either. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe there's a different perspective. \n\nWait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm trying to figure out if that's accurate. The author is not preventing the boyfriend from getting gauges, just expressing dislike. So maybe she's not wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that she's being controlling by setting such a strong boundary. But given that body modification is a personal choice, the boyfriend's actions could be seen as respecting his autonomy despite her feelings. However, her feelings are valid, and if he's going against her expressed wishes, maybe that's a red flag. \n\nI think I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because she communicated her feelings and the boyfriend is making a choice that affects their relationship. If he can't respect her feelings, maybe the issue is on his side. So answer B.\n"
