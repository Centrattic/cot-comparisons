When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the woman (25F) doesn't like body modifications and made that clear to her boyfriend (26M) when they met. They've been dating three years, and he has none. Now he wants to get gauges for a friend who's sober, but she's upset and called it trashy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made her feelings known from the start, which is reasonable. She's expressing her dislike, which he respected until now. The boyfriend is now wanting to do something that he feels is meaningful for his friend. But she finds it unappealing and even associated it with people she dislikes. The boyfriend got mad and accused her of being controlling.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author communicated her stance clearly, so the boyfriend knew her feelings. However, the boyfriend is now making a choice that directly affects their relationship. If he respects her boundaries, he might choose not to go through with the gauges. On the other hand, if he feels it's important, maybe he should proceed but consider the relationship impact.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend is upset because he feels she's controlling. Is she overstepping? Well, she's expressing a personal dislike, not forcing him to do anything. She's not stopping him, just expressing her opinion. However, by making it a deal-breaker, she might be imposing her preferences as a condition for staying in the relationship. That could be seen as controlling if she's using this as a reason to end the relationship rather than discussing it.\n\nBut then again, if he's making a choice that she's uncomfortable with despite her clear communication, maybe she's justified in reconsidering the relationship. It's a tough call. The author isn't forcing him, but she's also setting boundaries. The boyfriend is acting on his own choice, but not respecting her feelings as a deal-breaker. Maybe the issue is about mutual respect. Both need to find a middle ground, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for having her own standards. However, maybe she's being too rigid. If the boyfriend is willing to proceed despite her feelings, it's a conflict in values. The answer hinges on whether her setting boundaries counts as controlling versus being assertive. \n\nI think the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because she communicated her feelings upfront and isn't forcing him to do anything. The boyfriend is choosing to act against her known preferences, which could be a red flag for her. However, if she's using this as a reason to end the relationship without compromise, maybe she's being too strict. But overall, I think her stance is reasonable given she made her feelings clear.\n"
