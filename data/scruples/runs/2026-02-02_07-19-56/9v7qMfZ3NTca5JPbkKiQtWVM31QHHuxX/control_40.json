When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the author opposing it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. The boyfriend, after three years of dating, now wants to get gauges to support a friend who's into body mods and celebrating sobriety. He says it means a lot to his friend, but the author is upset because it reminds her of \"scumbag\" types.\n\nThe author argues that she's being clear about her preferences, and the boyfriend is going against that. The boyfriend, on the other hand, feels controlled. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nI should consider whether the author is being controlling. She expressed her dislike from the beginning, and he's now making a choice that she doesn't agree with. But is that controlling? Maybe not if she's not forcing him to do something. However, if she's pressuring him not to get the gauges, that could be an issue. But in this case, she's asking him not to do it, which is different from forcing. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reasoning is about supporting a friend's milestone. That's a personal choice. The author's discomfort is valid because she's expressed her feelings, but does that give her the right to dictate his choices? Relationships require compromise, but each person should have autonomy over their own body. \n\nThe boyfriend getting angry and calling her controlling might be a reaction to her trying to influence his decision, but if she's made her stance clear and he's aware of her feelings, his choice to go ahead despite that could be seen as respecting his autonomy. However, the author might feel betrayed if he's ignoring her stated preferences. \n\nBut the crux is whether her opposition is controlling. If she's not trying to force him but is expressing her feelings and asking him to consider her perspective, that's healthy communication. However, if she's using emotional manipulation to stop him, that's different. The situation isn't clear on that. The author says she told him she hates it, but she's not preventing him from doing it. \n\nIn relationships, partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author's boundary was communicated early on. The boyfriend is now choosing to cross that boundary, which might be a problem. But if they can't find a middle ground, maybe the issue is bigger than just the gauges. \n\nThe author's reasoning about associating body mods with \"scumbag\" types might be a personal bias, which isn't fair to apply to others. However, her feelings are valid. The boyfriend's decision is about personal choice and support for a friend. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings and setting her boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction of anger and calling her controlling seems excessive. The real issue is whether they can respect each other's autonomy and feelings. The author isn't controlling if she's allowing him to make his own choice but expressing her discomfort. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
