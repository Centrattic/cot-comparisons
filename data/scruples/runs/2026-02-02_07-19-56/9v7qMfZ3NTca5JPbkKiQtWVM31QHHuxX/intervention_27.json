When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author (a 25-year-old woman) telling her boyfriend (26-year-old man) not to get gauges, which he wants to get as a show of solidarity with a friend who's celebrating sobriety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications, considering them \"trashy.\" Now, the boyfriend wants to get small gauges. The author objects, and he gets mad, calling her controlling. She's now considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes despite knowing her feelings.\n\nThe main issue here is about boundaries and respect in a relationship. The author expressed her dislike early on, so the boyfriend should have considered that. However, he's making this decision for personal reasons, which he explains as supporting a friend. The question is whether her objection is valid or if she's being controlling.\n\nI think both sides have some points. The author has a right to her feelings and should be able to express them. But if the boyfriend is making a personal choice that's non-harmful (assuming gauging isn't dangerous), he might feel his autonomy is being invaded. However, in relationships, partners often have to compromise. If she made her stance clear and he still proceeds, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, if she's using her disapproval to control his decisions, that could be an issue.\n\nThe author's reasoning isn't based on safety but on personal dislike. If the boyfriend is an adult and the decision is his to make, she might not have the right to stop him. However, the fact that he's doing it for a friend's sobriety adds context. It's possible he's trying to support his friend in a way that's meaningful to them, which might outweigh her disapproval. Yet, she's in a relationship where she's uncomfortable with this choice, which affects her feelings about continuing the relationship.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the boyfriend knew her feelings and still chose to go against them without negotiation, that could be seen as dismissive. However, if she's using her disapproval to control him without considering his autonomy, she might be at fault. The key is whether she's respecting his right to make his own decisions, even if he has to consider her feelings. Since she made her stance clear and he's choosing to act despite that, maybe she's within her rights to be upset, but if she's pressuring him to conform, that's where the issue lies.\n\nI think the answer hinges on mutual respect and compromise. If there's no room for negotiation, then both could be at fault. But the boyfriend's action might be a personal expression, and the author's objection is about aesthetics and associations. If the boyfriend isn't violating any rules beyond her preferences, perhaps she's overstepping. But if their relationship requires mutual respect for each other's boundaries, then he's not respecting hers by proceeding. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong if she's clearly communicated her feelings and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. But if she's trying to control his body modifications beyond her own feelings, then maybe she is in the wrong.\n"
