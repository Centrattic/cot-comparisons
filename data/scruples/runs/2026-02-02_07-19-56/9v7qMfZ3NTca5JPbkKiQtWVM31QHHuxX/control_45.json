When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. So the situation is that the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges as a show of solidarity with his friend who's a body mod enthusiast. The friend recently became sober, and he wants to celebrate by getting small gauges. The author had previously made it clear she dislikes body mods, thinking they're trashy, and it reminds her of scumbag people her sister dated. The boyfriend got mad, called her controlling, and now she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nThe author had already communicated her dislike for body modifications when they met. That's important because she set her boundaries early on. The boyfriend now wants to get gauges despite knowing her feelings. He says it's to support his friend, which is a personal choice. But the author is upset because he's going against her preferences.\n\nNow, in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author is expressing her comfort level, which she's been clear about. However, the boyfriend might feel his autonomy is being restricted. The question is whether the author is overstepping by asking him not to do something that's his personal choice, even if they discussed it before.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend is making a choice that affects their relationship. If the author is uncomfortable with body mods, and this is something he's doing after knowing her stance, maybe that's a conflict. However, the boyfriend's reasoning is about supporting a friend, which he might see as important. But the author might feel that he's disregarding her feelings.\n\nThe line between respecting personal choice and being controlling can be blurry. The author's concern is valid if she finds the gauges unappealing. But if the boyfriend is going ahead despite her objections, that could indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings. Conversely, if the author is making a decision about his body based on her preferences, that could be controlling.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author could have discussed the issue to find a solution that works for both, like getting a different type of piercing or finding another way to support the friend. However, the boyfriend's decision to proceed might have crossed a line by ignoring her clear communication.\n\nBut does that make the author in the wrong? She's not forcing him; she's expressing her discomfort. He's the one choosing to act against her wishes. So maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong here. However, the situation is complex. It's about personal autonomy versus mutual respect.\n\nAnother angle: if the boyfriend had previously respected her boundaries and this was a new development, maybe the author's reaction is reasonable. The boyfriend might not have considered how this would affect her, even if he has his own reasons. On the other hand, the author might need to accept that her partner has different values and that she can't control his choices.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author's request is reasonable. She's not asking him to not have any piercings; it's specifically about gauges. If he had gotten regular piercings, she might be okay. But gauges are different. She communicated her dislike, and he's proceeding. The boyfriend's argument about solidarity might be valid, but he should have discussed it with her first. The fact that he got angry and called her controlling suggests he might feel his autonomy is being attacked.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings. However, the boyfriend's reaction and decision to proceed without considering her feelings might be the issue. Relationships require negotiation, and if both parties aren't willing to compromise, that's a problem. But since the author had communicated her stance and the boyfriend is choosing to go against it, the fault isn't solely on her. Maybe both sides have some responsibility. But according to the question, the options are A (author wrong) or B (author not wrong). Given that the author is stating her boundaries and the boyfriend is acting against them, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
