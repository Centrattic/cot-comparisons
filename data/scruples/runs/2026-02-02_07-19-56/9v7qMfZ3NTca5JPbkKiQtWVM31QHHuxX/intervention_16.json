When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that she made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating for three years, and now he wants to get gauges as a gesture of solidarity with a friend. He's upset, calls her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author communicated her feelings about body mods early on in the relationship. The boyfriend didn't have any issues with this for three years but now wants to get gauges. The reason given is to support a friend's sobriety celebration. The author feels conflicted because she doesn't want him to get them, even though she acknowledges others might like it. The boyfriend feels she's being controlling. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for expressing her dislike? Well, relationships involve communication and respecting each other's boundaries. She made her stance known before the relationship started. Now, the boyfriend is making a personal choice that she finds unappealing. But he's doing it for a friend, not necessarily to go against her. However, the author is upset because he's going against her wishes.\n\nBut wait, does she have the right to dictate his body modifications? Body autonomy is important. Just because she finds it trashy doesn't mean he shouldn't do it. He might value his friend's feelings more. However, she might feel that he's not respecting her feelings. But he knew her stance and is choosing to proceed. \n\nOn the other hand, if she communicated clearly and he's still going ahead, maybe he's entitled to his choice. The fact that he's doing it for a friend's sobriety adds context\u2014it's a meaningful gesture. The author's reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially if their relationship is about mutual respect and compromise. \n\nBut then, if the author is uncomfortable to the point of considering the relationship over this, maybe there's a deeper issue. However, the boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling is harsh. He should have discussed it with her, found a middle ground. If he's willing to do something that upsets her, maybe he's not respecting her enough. \n\nSo, considering all angles: the author had expressed her preferences, but body autonomy is a factor. The boyfriend's decision is personal, even if it upsets her. However, the author's reaction might be too extreme if she's ending the relationship over this. But maybe the boyfriend should have considered her feelings more. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key here is whether the author is being controlling by asking him not to do it. But controlling would be if she's pressuring him to conform to her preferences. However, she's not pressuring him; she's expressing her feelings. The boyfriend is making a choice that she doesn't like. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if she's making a big deal out of it and threatening to end the relationship, that could be her fault. \n\nWait, the question is specifically about whether she's in the wrong for asking him not to get gauges. So, the act of expressing her dislike isn't wrong. However, if she's using the relationship to control his choices, that's different. Since she communicated her stance upfront and he's now making a choice that she finds unappealing, she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe because body autonomy is a strong argument. However, the author's discomfort is valid. It's a balance between personal choice and relationship dynamics. \n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because she communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend is making a personal choice despite that. However, the boyfriend's reaction of being angry and calling her controlling is more of an issue. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
