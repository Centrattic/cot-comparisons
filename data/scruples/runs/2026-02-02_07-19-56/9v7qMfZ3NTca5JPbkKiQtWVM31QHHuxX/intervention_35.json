When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the author opposing it.\n\nFirst, the author made her stance clear from the start that she doesn't like body mods. The boyfriend, after three years, decides he wants to get gauges for a friend's sobriety. The author objects because she finds it trashy and it reminds her of her sister's exes. The boyfriend gets mad, calls her controlling, and now she's considering leaving the relationship.\n\nHmm. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Body modifications like gauges are a personal choice. The boyfriend wants to do it for a friend, which seems like a positive reason. However, the author had expressed her dislike early on. But if they've been in a relationship for three years, maybe the boyfriend expected some compromise or change in her opinion? Or maybe she didn't communicate her feelings well enough?\n\nWait, the author said she made it clear she doesn't like them when they met. So the boyfriend knew. Now, he's going against her wishes. But isn't personal autonomy important here? The boyfriend has the right to make his own body decisions. If the author is pressuring him not to do something he wants for a valid reason, that could be controlling. But the boyfriend's reaction might be over the top. He could have discussed it more calmly.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. She has a reason to be upset if this goes against her values. However, if the boyfriend is making a decision that affects their relationship, maybe they should find a middle ground. But the key here is that the author expressed her views early, and the boyfriend is now making a choice that respects his friend but disregards her feelings. It's a conflict between personal autonomy and respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nI think the boyfriend has a valid reason (supporting a friend's sobriety), but the author's feelings shouldn't be ignored. However, if the author is using her disapproval to control his decisions, that's a problem. The boyfriend calling her controlling might be a justified reaction if she's not giving him space to make his own choices. The author might be in the wrong if she's being controlling without considering his autonomy. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
