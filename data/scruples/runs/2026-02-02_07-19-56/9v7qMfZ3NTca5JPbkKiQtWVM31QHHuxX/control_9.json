When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Ask the Ask (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get gauges, but the girlfriend has made her dislike of body modifications clear. The boyfriend is upset, calling her controlling, and she's now doubting the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend mentioned she's been clear from the start that she doesn't like body mods, so the boyfriend knew about her stance. However, he still wants to proceed, which she sees as disregarding her feelings. On the other hand, the boyfriend argues that it's a personal choice and a meaningful gesture for his friend's sobriety. \n\nBody modifications can be personal choices, and in a healthy relationship, there's a balance between respecting each other's preferences and personal autonomy. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend communicated her dislike early on, which is important. But when does a preference become a controlling behavior? It might depend on whether she's trying to control his decisions or just expressing her discomfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction to being called controlling is a red flag. If he's dismissing her feelings as controlling rather than discussing it, that could be a problem. However, the girlfriend's response is to consider ending the relationship because he's ignoring her. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the boyfriend is within his right to make this choice despite her dislike. If he's not pressuring her to accept it and she's not trying to stop him (unless there's a safety issue), then maybe she's not wrong. But if she's using the relationship to influence his decisions against his wishes, that could be controlling. However, in this case, she's stating her feelings and not necessarily forbidding him, but he might feel she's being restrictive. \n\nThe fact that he's getting it for a friend's solidarity might also play a role. If it's a significant milestone (sobriety), he might feel it's important. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. \n\nI need to consider cultural aspects. Gauges are a form of self-expression, and in a relationship, both need to respect each other's autonomy unless it affects the other person's well-being. Since the girlfriend's dislike is more about her personal aesthetic and associations, not a safety or health issue, the boyfriend has the right to choose, even if it goes against her preferences. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but the boyfriend might be in the wrong for dismissing her and not considering her feelings enough. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she communicated her stance and isn't forcing him to not get the gauges but is upset because he's going against her wishes, it's a bit of a gray area. But given that personal autonomy is important, the boyfriend's decision is his own, and the girlfriend isn't wrong for having feelings. So maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
