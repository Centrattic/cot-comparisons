When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend asking her boyfriend not to get gauges, and the boyfriend got angry, calling her controlling. The woman says she made her feelings clear from the start, and now he's going against her wishes.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what AITA (Am I the Asshole) considers. The key points here are about personal boundaries and mutual respect. The woman communicated her dislike for body modifications early in the relationship. The boyfriend, after three years, decides to get gauges, which the woman strongly objects to. \n\nThe arguments in favor of the woman (option B) would be that she expressed her feelings upfront, and the boyfriend is now making a choice that goes against her clearly stated preferences. This could be seen as a lack of respect for her boundaries, especially since the boyfriend is getting the gauges as a personal choice, even though it's for a friend's solidarity. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might argue that he has the right to express himself, and that his partner shouldn't control his personal choices. If he had a valid reason (like supporting a friend's sobriety) and the gauges are described as \"small,\" maybe it's a reasonable compromise. However, the woman's objection is based on her personal dislike and associations, which might be subjective. But since she made her stance clear, the boyfriend should have considered her feelings before proceeding.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the woman) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The main factors here are communication and mutual respect. The woman communicated her stance early. The boyfriend's reaction of anger to her objection suggests a possible lack of respect for her feelings. The woman's hesitation about the relationship because he's going against her wishes indicates that the issue is significant to her. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether both parties acted in good faith. The woman isn't forbidding him from anything; she's expressing her dislike and asking him not to do it. The boyfriend, however, is choosing to go ahead despite her clear communication, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, considering these points, the woman is not in the wrong. She set boundaries, and the boyfriend is not respecting them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
