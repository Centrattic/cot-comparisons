When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges, but the girlfriend, who already made it clear she doesn't like body modifications, is against it. He got angry and called her controlling, leading her to question the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe key points: \n- The girlfriend made it clear from the start she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. \n- They've been dating for three years, and nothing had changed until now. \n- The boyfriend wants to get gauges for a friend's solidarity, but she objects. \n- He got angry, accused her of being controlling, and she's now considering ending the relationship.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author communicated her dislike early on, so the boyfriend should have known this. However, he still wants to proceed. Is her objection controlling or respecting her own feelings?\n\nOn one hand, she's expressing her personal dislike, which is her right. She's not forcing him to not get the gauges, just expressing her feelings. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his autonomy is being restricted, especially if he sees his choice as a personal decision. \n\nBut the boyfriend knew her stance beforehand. If he still wants to go against her wishes, that could indicate a lack of respect for her feelings, which is a problem. However, the girlfriend is also expressing her boundaries, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction of getting angry and calling her controlling could be an issue, as it's dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's just expressing her opinion and not physically or emotionally pressuring him, then no. However, if she's trying to control his decisions, that's different. But according to the story, she's just stating her dislike. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his response to her opinion. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing her feelings, especially since she communicated them upfront. The boyfriend's anger and accusation of control might be the problem here. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
