When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is about body modifications, which can be a sensitive topic in relationships.\n\nFirst, the author made her stance clear before they started dating. She doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy and associates them with negative stereotypes. Now, the boyfriend wants to get gauges to support a friend who's sober. The author is upset, and he's upset with her for being controlling.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author communicated her feelings upfront. It's reasonable for her to have preferences and express them. On the other hand, the boyfriend is making a personal choice to support a friend, which is important to him. The key here is whether the author's request is overstepping. \n\nBody modifications are usually a personal choice. Even if the author has her preferences, her boyfriend's decision to get gauges is about his own values and relationships. The fact that he's doing it for a friend's sobriety adds a layer of personal significance. The author might feel it's a betrayal, but she did agree to the relationship knowing his friend is into mods. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction that she's controlling is a red flag. It suggests he might not respect her boundaries, or he's not willing to compromise. However, the author is also asserting her comfort zone. The line between respecting each other's choices and feeling controlled is thin here. \n\nSince the author had already communicated her dislike and the boyfriend is now acting against her wishes, it's a conflict of values. The answer depends on whether the author's request is reasonable. Since body mods are personal, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her discomfort, but the boyfriend's refusal to consider her feelings could be problematic. However, the main question is about the author's fault. Given that she's standing by her initial feelings and he's making a choice that affects their relationship, the author isn't at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
