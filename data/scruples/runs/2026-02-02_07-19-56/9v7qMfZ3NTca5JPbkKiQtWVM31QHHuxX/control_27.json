When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges, and the author (girlfriend) is against it. They've been dating three years, and she made her feelings clear from the start. Now he wants to do it as a show of solidarity with a friend who's sober. She thinks it's trashy and it reminds her of people she dislikes. He got mad, called her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's being controlling or if she's within her rights. She expressed her dislike early on, which is fair. However, when he decides to go through with it anyway, is he overstepping? Or is she overstepping by opposing his choice?\n\nIn relationships, personal freedom is a factor. He might feel his autonomy is being restricted. But she had communicated her preferences. However, he could have considered her feelings more, especially since it's a significant change. But he's also making a personal choice that's not directly affecting her. \n\nThe key points are: she communicated her dislike early, he chose to proceed despite that, leading to conflict. She's questioning if she's in the wrong for not wanting him to get gauges. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to their own body modifications unless it affects the other partner directly. Since it's his body, he has the right to modify it. However, she might feel disrespected if he didn't take her feelings into account. The fact that he's doing it for a friend's sobriety might be a good reason for him, but it's his decision. \n\nIf he knew her feelings and still went ahead, maybe he should have discussed it more to find a compromise. But she's also not in the wrong for having her own preferences. So maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong (B). But some might say she's controlling. However, since it's his body and her dislike is a personal opinion, she's not wrong for expressing it. He's wrong to get angry for that reason. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
