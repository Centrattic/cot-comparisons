When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their boyfriend not to get gauges. The boyfriend is considering getting gauges to support a friend's sobriety, but the girlfriend dislikes body modifications, finding them trashy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend has been clear about her dislike of body mods from the start, and they've been together three years. The boyfriend's friends are involved, and he sees this as a meaningful gesture. The girlfriend feels it's trashy and reminds her of her sister's exes, which might be a personal bias. The boyfriend got upset, called her controlling, and now she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? On one hand, the boyfriend should respect her feelings since she's made them clear. But on the other hand, he's making a personal choice to support a friend, which might be important to him. The key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. The girlfriend is expressing her discomfort, but is it controlling? If she's not trying to force him to not get the gauges but is expressing her feelings, maybe she's not wrong. However, if she's pressuring him not to do it despite his reasons, that's where it could go wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might be over the top if he's choosing his friend's approval over his partner's feelings. But the girlfriend might be overstepping if she's trying to control his body. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the girlfriend is respecting his autonomy. If she's just expressing her feelings and he's still choosing to go ahead, she's not in the wrong. But if she's trying to prevent him from doing it, maybe she is. The question is whether her stance is controlling. The boyfriend might be right to feel that she's being controlling if she's not allowing him to make his own choice despite her disapproval. However, if she's communicated her feelings and he's aware, he still has a choice. The girlfriend's concern is valid as part of the relationship, but she shouldn't make the decision for him. So maybe she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings but might be if she's pressuring him. The scenario says she told him she hates it, and he chose to proceed. The boyfriend's anger could be an overreaction if he's making a personal choice. But if the girlfriend is trying to dictate his body modifications, that's controlling. The key is whether she's respecting his autonomy. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's expressing her feelings and he's making a choice to proceed despite that. The boyfriend's reaction could be the issue here if he's not respecting her feelings but acting on his own.\n"
