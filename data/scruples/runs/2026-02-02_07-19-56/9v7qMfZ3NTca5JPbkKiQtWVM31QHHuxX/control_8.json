When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple has been dating for three years. The author made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she associates them with \"trashy\" people, even though she acknowledges others might like them. Now, her boyfriend wants to get small gauges to support a friend's sobriety. He gets upset, calls her controlling, and the author is considering ending the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal boundaries and respect. The author communicated her dislike early on, which is important. But the boyfriend is making a personal choice that's meaningful to him (supporting a friend's milestone). The question is whether the author is being controlling or if the boyfriend is overreacting.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's decision to get gauges might be a personal expression, and while the author has her preferences, he's an adult making his own choice. The author's objection is based on her feelings, which is valid, but pushing her preferences onto him could be seen as controlling. On the other hand, if the boyfriend had agreed not to get any body mods initially, then the author would have a stronger case. But since the boyfriend is taking a step that's important to him, and the author is now objecting after three years of being clear, maybe the boyfriend is within his rights to do what he wants. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being angry and calling her controlling is a red flag. Maybe he's not respecting her boundaries, or maybe he's overreacting. The author is conflicted because she's worried about controlling versus respecting his autonomy. \n\nBut in relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The author set a boundary, but the boyfriend is choosing to cross it. If he knew her stance and still wants to proceed, that's his choice. However, if the author feels it's a deal-breaker, that's her choice too. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expressing her dislike. Since she communicated her feelings and he's choosing to ignore them, maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. But some people might argue that she shouldn't control his body modifications. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). She communicated her feelings, and while he has the right to make his own choice, her objection is based on her preferences, and she's not forcing him to do anything. The boyfriend's anger and calling her controlling might be the issue here. The author is not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. So the answer is B."
