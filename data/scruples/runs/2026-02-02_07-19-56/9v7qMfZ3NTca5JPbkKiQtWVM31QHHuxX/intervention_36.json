When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to get gauges. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made it clear when they met that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating for three years, and nothing changed until recently. Now, the boyfriend wants to get gauges to support his friend who's a body mod enthusiast and recently became sober. The girlfriend is upset and feels it's trashy, which makes her boyfriend mad, calling her controlling. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication, boundaries, and respect. The girlfriend expressed her dislike for body mods upfront, which is important. However, the boyfriend is now wanting to get gauges for a reason related to his friend's sobriety, which seems like a personal choice. The question is whether the girlfriend is overstepping by opposing this.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend has the right to express her discomfort. She's not asking him to not have friends or support his friend; she's just objecting to the specific body modification. But on the other hand, after three years, is it reasonable for the boyfriend to feel that his personal choice is being controlled? He might feel that her stance is restrictive, especially if his reason is personal and not just following trends. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's a meaningful act for his friend could be a valid reason for him to proceed. If the girlfriend is against it despite his reasons, she might be seen as controlling, as he pointed out. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's choices unless it directly affects the other person negatively. Here, the girlfriend's dislike is more about personal aesthetics and associations rather than health or safety. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend mentioned it's not about the mods themselves but the type of people she associates with them. That could be a personal bias. However, she's not forcing him to do anything; she's just expressing her preference. The boyfriend's reaction of anger and calling her controlling might stem from feeling that his autonomy is being challenged. \n\nSo, is the girlfriend wrong? If she's respecting his choice but expressing her discomfort, she's not necessarily in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him not to do it or making him feel guilty, that's different. The situation is tricky. The boyfriend knew her stance but still wants to proceed, which might be his right. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. \n\nIn relationships, partners have to navigate conflicting preferences. The key is whether the girlfriend is being controlling or just expressing her opinion. If she's not forcing him but stating her feelings, she's not in the wrong. But if she's using emotional pressure to stop him, that's more controlling. The text says she told him she hates it, and he got mad. The line between expressing a preference and being controlling can be thin. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is that the girlfriend isn't in the wrong. She communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend's reaction is about his autonomy. Alternatively, maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. But I think the main point is that the girlfriend isn't controlling if she's not stopping him from doing it. She can express her dislike without being controlling. However, if she's making him feel like he can't do something he wants for himself, that's controlling. The text says she told him she hates it, and he got angry. The boyfriend's anger might be disproportionate. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B). She communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend's reaction is his own issue. But maybe there's a balance here. The boyfriend's reason is personal, which is a valid reason. The girlfriend's dislike is personal too. The real issue is whether the girlfriend is respecting his autonomy. If she's allowing him to make the choice but just sharing her feelings, that's okay. If she's trying to prevent him, that's controlling. The text doesn't say she's preventing him, just that she's expressing her dislike. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
