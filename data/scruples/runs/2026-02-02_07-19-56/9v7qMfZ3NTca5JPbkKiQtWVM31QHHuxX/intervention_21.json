When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a 25-year-old woman, and her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating for three years, and neither of them has any body modifications. When they first met, she made it clear that she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy, even though she acknowledges others might like them. Now, her boyfriend wants to get ear gauges as a way to show solidarity with his friend who's a body mod enthusiast and just became sober. He says it would mean a lot to his friend, but the author is against it because of her personal dislike and associations. He got mad and accused her of being controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship because he's going ahead despite her feelings.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author communicated her stance on body mods early on. The boyfriend, who had no prior body mods, is now considering getting one for a personal reason\u2014supporting a friend's sobriety. The friend is a \"big body mod enthusiast,\" so maybe the gauges are part of a tradition or celebration in that community. The author is upset because she finds it trashy and has negative associations, which makes her feel that her boyfriend is going against her values, even though he knew her feelings beforehand.\n\nThe key points here are communication, respect for boundaries, and the justification behind the request. The author did express her dislike for body mods when they met, so the boyfriend should have known her opinion. However, she's now asking him not to get gauges, and he feels it's a violation of his autonomy, hence calling her controlling. The boyfriend's reason for getting the gauges is to support his friend's sobriety, which is a positive intention. But the author is uncomfortable with the choice because of her personal preferences.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and values. The author made her views clear, so the boyfriend should have considered that before deciding to get the gauges. However, the boyfriend might also have his own autonomy and the right to make personal choices, especially when they are for a meaningful reason. The conflict arises because the author is upset now, even though she communicated her stance. Did the boyfriend overstep by not respecting her feelings, or is the author overstepping by trying to influence his decision based on her personal preferences?\n\nBody modifications are a personal choice, and unless there's a specific reason that affects the relationship (like a partner's explicit boundary about not being with someone who has certain mods), it's a matter of personal preference. The author didn't say she would break up over it when they met, but now she is considering it. That might indicate that her feelings have evolved or that she's more invested now. However, the boyfriend's action is a personal expression, and he might feel his autonomy is being challenged. \n\nIs the author being controlling? If she's asking him not to do something that is his personal choice, and he knew her opinion but still wants to proceed, it's possible she's overstepping. But if she communicated her boundaries and he's choosing to ignore them, that could be a breach of respect. The question is whether the boyfriend's reason for getting the gauges is a valid enough reason to go against the author's expressed dislike. \n\nThe gauges are small and in the ears, which is less extreme than other body mods. The boyfriend is doing it for a friend, which is a social reason, not a lifestyle change for himself. The author's issue is with the mods themselves, not the boyfriend's behavior or values beyond that. The boyfriend might feel that his friend's milestone is important, and he wants to participate in that celebration. But the author's discomfort is also valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend should have considered her feelings even if they were years ago. But the author's reaction now, leading to the consideration of ending the relationship, might be seen as holding onto a boundary that wasn't previously a deal-breaker. If she didn't make it explicit that she would end the relationship over this, then she might be shifting her stance. \n\nAlternatively, if she consistently communicated her dislike and it's a core value for her, then her reaction could be justified. The problem is whether the boyfriend's action is a significant enough breach given that he knew her opinion. The author is now feeling that this is a deal-breaker, which could be her right, but the question is whether she's in the wrong for that reaction. \n\nThe answer would depend on how controlling the author's request is. If she's asking him to adhere to her standards without respecting his autonomy, that's controlling. But if she's expressing her feelings and he's disregarding them, that's disrespectful. The situation is a bit of a gray area. The boyfriend moving forward despite her feelings could be seen as disrespectful, but the author's potential ultimatum might also be excessive if it's not something she previously considered a non-negotiable.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because she communicated her feelings, but if the boyfriend is making this decision for a personal reason (supporting his friend), she might be overstepping by pressuring him to change his mind. However, since the author is now considering ending the relationship over this, it could be that she's holding a personal dislike as a deal-breaker, which might not be fair. But it's also about mutual respect. If the boyfriend's decision makes the author feel that her values are not respected, then the relationship's foundation might be in question. \n\nThe boyfriend could have tried to find a middle ground, like getting a different type of piercing or something that's symbolic without the gauges. But the author's reaction is strong, perhaps because she didn't anticipate this happening and now feels her boundaries are being tested. \n\nIn conclusion, the author did express her views, but if she didn't make it a deal-breaker before, maybe she's being a bit controlling now. However, the boyfriend might have been aware of her feelings and chosen to ignore them, leading to the conflict. It's a two-way street. But according to the AITA framework, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend knew her stance and still proceeded, maybe he's in the wrong. But the author is upset because he's not respecting her feelings, so her reaction is valid. However, the question is whether she's being controlling by asking him not to get gauges. Since she's not forcing him, but expressing her dislike and potentially pushing for a breakup, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) if she's being controlling by making her personal preference a deal-breaker without prior discussion, or B (not in the wrong) if she's justified in her feelings. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because she communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend's choice to proceed despite that might be the issue. But I also think that the boyfriend should have considered her feelings more carefully, especially as a partner. However, the author is within her right to express her discomfort and reevaluate the relationship if she feels her boundaries are being disrespected, even if they weren't previously a deal-breaker. It's a complex situation where both sides have some responsibility. But the AITA format often looks at who is more at fault. Since the boyfriend went ahead without considering her feelings, maybe he's more at fault. But the author is now using this as a reason to end the relationship, which could be her being in the wrong if she's holding onto a boundary that wasn't previously a deal-breaker. However, since she made it clear and it's causing her distress, maybe she's not in the wrong. I'm still a bit stuck. The fact that she made it clear and he went against that shows disrespect, so the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
