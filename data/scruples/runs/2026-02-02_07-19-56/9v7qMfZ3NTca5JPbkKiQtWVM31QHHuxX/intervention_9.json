When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the boyfriend wanting to get ear gauges as a gesture for his friend's sobriety, and the author (a 25-year-old woman) expressing her dislike for body modifications, which she had made clear from the start of the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author had communicated her preferences upfront, which is important because transparency is key in relationships. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is considering a body mod that's meaningful to him personally and to his friend. The conflict arises from the author's disapproval leading to the boyfriend feeling controlled. \n\nIs the author being controlling? She's expressing her personal feelings, which she's had for a long time. However, the boyfriend is now making a decision that affects their relationship. The question is whether her objection is valid. Body modifications are a personal choice, and even if she finds them unattractive or associated with certain stereotypes, she shouldn't feel entitled to control her partner's decisions. \n\nBut wait, the boyfriend knew her stance beforehand. If he agreed with it then but is now changing his mind, maybe he's realizing his own preferences. However, the author is upset because he's going against her wishes. The crux here is whether it's reasonable for her to expect him not to get gauges now, given he was aware of her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's autonomy is crucial. Even if someone holds a strong opinion, they shouldn't force it onto their partner unless it's a mutual agreement. The boyfriend might feel that his right to make a personal choice is being infringed upon, especially if the gesture is significant to him. The author's justification is based on her personal dislike, which could be seen as a projection of her own biases rather than a valid reason for him to change his decision.\n\nOn the flip side, the boyfriend could have considered her feelings more and perhaps discussed it in a way that shows he respects her perspective while also explaining the importance of the gesture to him. But the author's right to have her own opinion is there, and if she can't accept that he might choose to do something she disagrees with, that's a problem in their relationship compatibility. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether personal preferences should override a partner's decisions when they're clearly communicated but not previously a deal-breaker. The author might be in the wrong because everyone has the right to their own body choices, even if it's not aligned with their partner's preferences. The boyfriend's anger at being called controlling could be a sign that he feels his autonomy is being dismissed. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong because she's expressing her feelings, but the boyfriend is also within his rights to proceed. However, the main question is about who's the asshole. The author is asking if she's in the wrong for requesting not to get gauges. Since the boyfriend is making a decision that affects his own body and has a personal reason, the author's objection might be seen as controlling, making her the asshole here.\n"
