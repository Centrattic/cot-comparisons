When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend (25F) asking her boyfriend (26M) not to get gauges because she doesn't like them. She made her feelings clear from the start when they met. Now, her boyfriend wants to get gauges as a show of solidarity with his friend who's a body mod enthusiast and recently became sober. When she told him she hates it because she finds it trashy and reminds her of her sister's exes, he got angry and called her controlling. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. The girlfriend communicated her dislike of body modifications from the beginning, which is important. The boyfriend knew this and still decided to proceed, which could be seen as disregarding her feelings. However, he's doing it for a friend's reason, which might add context. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She's not forcing him to do anything; she's expressing her preference and boundaries. If he chooses to go against that, it's his decision, but he needs to respect her feelings. However, if he's getting upset because he feels controlled, maybe there's an issue with how she communicated her feelings or how he's handling his own choices. \n\nOn the other hand, she made her stance clear, and he's aware. If he's choosing to go against her wishes, even for a friend's reason, he's not respecting her boundaries. She's not the one in the wrong if she's being honest about her preferences. However, if she's trying to control him without considering his reasons, maybe she could have been more flexible. But the fact that he's doing it for a friend might not be a strong enough reason to override her feelings if they were known all along.\n\nAnother angle is that their values might not align. If she can't accept his decision, and he can't respect her feelings, maybe they're incompatible. The main issue is whether her stance is controlling or expressing her own preferences. Since she's not forcing him to do anything, just asking him not to, she's within her rights. He's the one choosing to act against her wishes, which could be his issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she communicated her feelings clearly and is within her right to express her preferences. However, there's also a need for mutual respect. But the problem here is the boyfriend's reaction, not the girlfriend's stance. She's not the one in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n"
