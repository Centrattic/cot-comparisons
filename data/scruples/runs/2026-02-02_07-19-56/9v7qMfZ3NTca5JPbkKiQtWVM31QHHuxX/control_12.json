When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to get ear gauges. \n\nFirst, the author has made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. That's her personal preference, and she communicated it when they first met. Now, three years later, her boyfriend wants to get gauges as a solidarity gesture for his friend's sobriety. \n\nThe boyfriend, however, gets angry and calls her controlling. The key points here are communication and respect for boundaries. The author hasn't changed her stance, and she's honest about her feelings. The boyfriend knew her views before they started dating, so he should have considered that. If he respects her, he might have discussed alternatives or found a compromise. \n\nBut he decided to go ahead anyway, which leads her to question the relationship. The question is about whether she's at fault. Since she communicated her feelings upfront and he's making a choice that directly affects her comfort, it's more about respecting her boundaries. Unless there's a deeper issue, like controlling behavior, it seems like her stance is valid. \n\nSo the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong) because she's being honest about her preferences, and he's not respecting her boundaries by pushing through despite knowing her feelings.\n"
