When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend wanting to get gauges despite the girlfriend stating she doesn't like body modifications.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend made her feelings clear from the start that she finds body mods trashy. The boyfriend, after three years, wants to get gauges to support a friend's sobriety. He argues it's about solidarity, but she feels it's against her preferences and that he's being controlling by getting angry.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The girlfriend did communicate her stance early on. The boyfriend, while respecting her views for three years, is now choosing to go against her wishes. His anger at her for expressing her dislike might indicate a problem in how he handled the situation. However, he also has the right to his own body and choices, even if they conflict with her preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, she might be overstepping by trying to influence his personal decision, especially if she didn't set boundaries after the initial communication. But she's also within her rights to express her feelings. The main issue is whether his reaction was appropriate. If he felt controlled and got angry, that's a relationship issue. But the girlfriend's concern is valid if she feels her boundaries aren't respected.\n\nI think the boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling is a problem. It's important to respect each other's boundaries without invalidating their feelings. The girlfriend isn't wrong for having her feelings, but maybe she didn't consider his perspective enough. However, since she communicated her stance and he's now choosing to act against it, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's anger might be more about how he handles disagreements rather than the content of her feelings.\n"
