When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend wanting to get gauges, which the girlfriend doesn't like because she finds them trashy. She had made it clear before they started dating, but now he wants to do it for his friend's sobriety. He got mad and called her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman had communicated her dislike of body modifications from the start. That's important because she wasn't keeping it a secret. He chose to pursue the gauges despite her feelings. He's doing it for his friend's celebration, which is a personal choice, but he's also considering her feelings. However, she's upset because he's going against her wishes, even if it's for a friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she had clear boundaries and he's choosing to ignore them, that could be a red flag. On the other hand, he's making a personal choice that's not harmful to her directly, just something she finds unattractive or associated with negative stereotypes. \n\nBut the key here is consent and respect. She had communicated her stance, and he's making a choice that affects their relationship dynamics. If he's acting out of solidarity with a friend, it's his body, but the fact that she feels it's a deal-breaker might indicate deeper issues. \n\nHowever, she's not controlling him; she's expressing her feelings. He's the one making a choice that goes against her expressed preferences. So the responsibility might be on him for not respecting her feelings. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Wait, maybe I need to reevaluate.\n\nWait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. So the user might be leaning towards the boyfriend's side. Let me check again.\n\nThe woman had made her feelings clear from the start. The boyfriend is making a choice that she's uncomfortable with, even though he's not forced to get them for himself but for his friend. The issue is whether his choice is acceptable despite her feelings. If she's not okay with it and it's causing conflict, then maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. \n\nBut the flip side is that he's making a personal choice for his friend, which is important to him. The woman is asking him not to do something that's his own body modification. So it's a balance between personal freedom and respecting each other's feelings. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she had communicated her dislike, and he's choosing to proceed, maybe he's in the wrong. But if she's trying to control his body choices, that's different. However, in this case, she's not asking him to change his existing body mods, but to not get new ones. Since he doesn't have any currently, she's not trying to remove existing ones. \n\nSo the woman's stance is about future choices. If he's making a choice that she finds offensive, but it's his decision to make, then he's acting on his own. However, if she's not okay with it, and it's causing a break in the relationship, it's a conflict of values. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the answer is that the woman is not in the wrong because she had communicated her preferences. The boyfriend is making a choice that he's aware might upset her but proceeds anyway. So he's the one not respecting her feelings. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
