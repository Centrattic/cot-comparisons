When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting their boyfriend to get gauges. The boyfriend wanted to get them as a show of solidarity with his friend who's into body mods and recently sober. The author mentioned they hate gauges because they think they're trashy and remind them of scumbag exes from their sister. The boyfriend got mad and called her controlling.\n\nFirst, the author had made their feelings clear from the start of the relationship. They don't like body modifications. The boyfriend didn't take that into account when deciding to get gauges, even though he knew her stance. But he has a reason related to his friend's milestone. Body modifications can be personal choices, even if they conflict with a partner's preferences. However, the boyfriend's reaction being anger and calling her controlling might be an issue. The author is conflicted about continuing the relationship because he's going against her wishes despite knowing them.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. The author communicated their dislike for gauges upfront. The boyfriend's decision to proceed might not be wrong if he believes it's important for his friend. But the way he reacted (getting angry) could be problematic. It's a balance between personal freedom and respecting a partner's feelings. Since the author isn't physically or emotionally abusive, just expressing her opinion, it's more about mutual respect. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for dismissing her feelings and reacting negatively. So, the author isn't necessarily at fault here. Answer B.\n"
