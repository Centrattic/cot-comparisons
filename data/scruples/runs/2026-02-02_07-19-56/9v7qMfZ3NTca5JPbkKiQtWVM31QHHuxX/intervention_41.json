When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a 25-year-old woman) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend of three years not to get gauges. The key points here are the boyfriend's intentions and the girlfriend's stance.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend wants to get gauges to celebrate his friend's sobriety as a show of solidarity. That's a positive, supportive gesture towards a friend. The girlfriend made her dislike for body modifications clear from the start, and she's not against all body mods in general, just gauges because of her personal feelings and past associations. \n\nNow, the boyfriend feels that the girlfriend is being controlling. The girlfriend is conflicted because she's made her views known, but now he's going against her wishes. She's considering ending the relationship because he's proceeding despite her objections. \n\nThe main question is whether the girlfriend is in the wrong. On one hand, she's expressing her boundaries and preferences, which is important in any relationship. On the other, she's asking him to forgo a personal choice that's meaningful to him and his friend. \n\nBody modifications are a form of self-expression, and if the boyfriend doesn't have any other modifications and this is a one-time thing for a friend, it's his right to choose. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. The issue here is about mutual respect and compromise. If the boyfriend knew her stance and still chooses to go ahead, that might indicate he's prioritizing his own desires over hers, which could be seen as disrespectful. But at the same time, she might be overstepping by trying to control his personal decisions, especially if they don't directly affect her. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance between respecting each other's autonomy and respecting boundaries. If the boyfriend is willing to proceed despite her clear objections, it could strain the relationship. However, if the girlfriend is making a big deal out of a personal choice that doesn't harm her, that could also be problematic. \n\nThe line between being controlling and setting boundaries can be thin. If the boyfriend is not pressuring her to get any modifications and this is purely his decision, then his reaction of calling her controlling might be a misjudgment. Conversely, if the girlfriend is using her disapproval to influence his decision in a way that's not open to compromise, that could be controlling behavior. \n\nIn this case, since the boyfriend has a meaningful reason to get the gauges and the girlfriend is opposing it based on her personal preferences without considering his reasons, it might be that the girlfriend is overstepping. However, if he's not willing to respect her feelings and proceeds regardless, that's on him. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. So, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if she's not allowing her partner to make a personal choice that's respectful and doesn't harm her. But if she's made this clear and he's disregarding her feelings, maybe both have some responsibility. However, the question is from the perspective of the author. Since she's the one asking if she's in the wrong for making the request, the answer might hinge on whether her request is reasonable. \n\nGiven that body modifications are a personal choice and she's not asking him to change other aspects, but just this one, it's possible that her stance is a boundary, not control. However, if the boyfriend is going to proceed despite her clear communication, that could indicate issues in the relationship. But the question is about the author's wrongness. \n\nI think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong, because she's communicating her boundaries. However, if the boyfriend is acting out of spite or disrespect, that's his issue. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her discomfort with the gauges, especially if she's made it clear from the start. But if she's using that to control his decisions without considering his reasons, that's different. Since his reason is supporting a friend's sobriety, which is positive, her opposition might seem more about her dislike rather than a valid concern. But she's entitled to her feelings. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. Wait, but if she's using her disapproval to prevent him from doing something meaningful to him, that could be controlling. Hmm. This is a bit tricky. \n\nWait, the original question is from the user who thinks the author is in the wrong. The user's reasoning would be that the boyfriend is making a personal choice, and the author is being controlling. But the author's side is that she made her stance clear and he's ignoring her. \n\nThe key is whether the author is wrong for making the request. If she's not forcing him to get it, just expressing her feelings and asking, then she's not in the wrong. However, if she's using emotional manipulation to stop him, then maybe. But the text doesn't indicate that. She's stating her feelings and asking him not to do it. That's within her rights. However, if the boyfriend is proceeding despite her clear communication, that's his choice. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her discomfort, but the boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings. However, the question is specifically about the author. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
