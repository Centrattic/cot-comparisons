When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a 25-year-old woman, her boyfriend is 26. They've been dating for three years and neither of them had any body modifications until now. When they first met, she made it clear she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. Now he wants to get gauges as a solidarity gesture for his friend who's into body mods and recently became sober.\n\nShe told him she hates the idea, and he got mad, calling her controlling. Now she's considering if she wants to stay in the relationship because he went ahead with the idea despite knowing her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author communicated her feelings upfront, which is good. In a relationship, it's important to be honest about your boundaries and preferences. She made it clear she doesn't like body mods, so he should have taken that into account. However, he has his own reasons for wanting to get the gauges\u2014supporting a friend's milestone. \n\nBut here's the thing: even if the reason is important to him, he knew her stance. If he values her feelings, he should have discussed it more, maybe found a compromise. The fact that he got mad and called her controlling suggests that he might not be respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, she's also making a big deal about this. Maybe the gauges are small, and it's a minor mod. But she associated it with negative stereotypes, which could be a personal issue.\n\nIs it her fault for not accepting that he might want to do this? Or is it his fault for not respecting her feelings? Relationships require mutual respect. If she communicated her dislike and he still wants to do it, that's a problem. But if she's being overly controlling, that's another issue. However, since she made her feelings clear from the start and this is a new development, it's more about him not respecting her boundaries. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's getting them for a friend's solidarity might not be a strong enough reason if it's causing conflict. Maybe they need to talk about it more. But the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she expressed her feelings and he's choosing to go against them, the issue is on his side. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
