When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend wanting to get gauges despite the girlfriend's dislike.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made her stance clear from the start. She told him she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. They've been dating three years, and he never pursued it until now. Now he wants to get gauges to support a friend who's sober. She says no, he gets mad, calls her controlling, and she's considering breaking up.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she communicated her feelings upfront. That's important. He should have respected that. But he chose to go against her wishes for his friend. On the flip side, he might feel his friend's milestone is important. But the key here is that she already expressed her dislike, and he went ahead anyway. He could have tried to find a compromise, like getting something smaller that she's okay with, or not doing it. But he didn't. So maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries.\n\nBut the question is about the author, the girlfriend. The user thinks she's in the wrong. But in my view, she stood by her values. He knew her stance and still proceeded. So she's not in the wrong. He's the one who violated her boundaries. The answer would be B, No.\n"
