When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend doesn't like body modifications, especially gauges. She made that clear from the start when they met. Now, after three years, the boyfriend wants to get gauges to support a friend who's celebrating sobriety. The girlfriend objects, and he gets mad, calling her controlling. She's now considering if she wants to continue the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend communicated her dislike of body mods early on, which is important. She might feel that he's not respecting her feelings by going against what she clearly stated. On the other hand, the boyfriend wants to do something meaningful for a friend's milestone, which is a personal choice he might feel is important. The key points here are communication, respect, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is based on her personal preferences, which she shared upfront. The boyfriend, however, is choosing to act against her wishes, possibly without considering how it affects their relationship. But then again, the boyfriend might feel that his personal autonomy is being restricted, especially since the issue isn't life-threatening or harmful to the relationship. \n\nI should think about whether it's reasonable for the girlfriend to expect her partner to avoid certain body modifications. Since she made her position clear, it's reasonable for her to express her discomfort again. However, the boyfriend's desire to support a friend is also a valid reason. The conflict arises when personal choices clash with relationship boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is about controlling behavior. If the girlfriend is making a big deal out of something that's not a deal-breaker initially, maybe she's overstepping. But if she's been consistent and the boyfriend is ignoring her feelings without discussion, that could be an issue. The boyfriend's reaction of being angry and calling her controlling might indicate a lack of empathy for her perspective.\n\nBut here's the thing: in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend knew this from the start, he should have considered it. However, changing one's mind or having a significant reason (like supporting a friend's sobriety) might be seen as a valid reason to go ahead. The problem is whether the girlfriend's objection is reasonable given the context. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend should have discussed it more, considering her feelings, but the girlfriend might be in the wrong if she's imposing her preferences without mutual agreement. However, since she communicated her dislike early on, the boyfriend's decision to proceed despite that could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHmm. So, balancing both sides, it's possible that the girlfriend isn't wrong because she communicated her stance, and the boyfriend is making a choice that disregards her feelings. But then again, if the boyfriend's reason is legitimate, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. It's tricky. \n\nI think the key here is that in the beginning, the girlfriend made her position clear. The boyfriend, knowing that, is choosing to go against her wishes. That could be seen as disregarding her feelings, hence the girlfriend isn't in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's autonomy is also important. But since it's a relationship, mutual respect is necessary. So, the girlfriend is not entirely wrong because she expressed her boundaries, and the boyfriend is overreacting by getting angry. The boyfriend should have discussed it more, considered her feelings, and perhaps found a compromise. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
