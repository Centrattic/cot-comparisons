When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The boyfriend has no body modifications, same as the author. When they met, she made it clear she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. Now, three years later, he wants to get gauges to support his friend's sobriety. She objects, linking it to negative associations, and he gets angry, calling her controlling. She's considering ending the relationship because he's proceeding despite her dislike.\n\nFirst, the key points here are communication and boundaries. The author had communicated her dislike upfront, so he was aware of her stance. However, he later decided to go against that, leading to conflict. The boyfriend's motivation is friendship support, which is a personal choice. The author's reaction is based on her personal preference, but she's now upset because he's ignoring her feelings.\n\nBut wait, in relationships, mutual respect is important. If he made a choice that affects their relationship dynamics, especially after knowing her feelings, does that make her wrong for being upset? Or is he wrong for disregarding her boundaries? The boyfriend might argue that personal freedom is important, but the author might see it as a betrayal of trust since she had communicated her stance clearly.\n\nAlso, considering that body modifications are a personal choice, but when it affects a partner's comfort, it's a shared issue. The author might not be wrong in expressing her feelings, but if she's making a demand that affects his autonomy, that could be an issue. However, he knew her views when they started, so maybe he should have considered that before proceeding.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's reasoning (supporting a friend's sobriety) could be seen as positive, but the author's discomfort is valid. If he went ahead despite her clear communication, that's dismissive of her feelings. However, the author's initial stance was based on a dislike, not a deal-breaker. So, is it fair for her to end the relationship over this? It depends on how they handle conflicts and whether they can compromise.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she communicated her dislike early on and he agreed, then changing his mind later without considering her feelings could be his fault. However, the author's reaction to end the relationship might be extreme if he's acting on his own autonomy, even if it upsets her. But the key is whether she's being controlling. She's expressing her feelings, not controlling his choices. However, if she's making a demand that he shouldn't act on his own values, that's different.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but if she's making a rigid demand without room for compromise, that could be an issue. However, the boyfriend might be at fault for not respecting her feelings after they were communicated. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to see if there's a justification for that. Maybe the author is overstepping by trying to control his body choices, even if she communicated them. Relationships require balancing personal autonomy and mutual respect. If she's making him feel controlled, that's a problem. But if he's ignoring her feelings, that's also a problem. The answer hinges on whether communication and compromise were attempted.\n"
