When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get gauges, and the author, who's 25F, is against it. They've been dating for three years, and she made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. Now, he wants to get gauges as a show of solidarity with a friend who's been sober, and she's upset. He got mad and called her controlling, and she's considering breaking up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author communicated her feelings early on. She's not against body mods herself, but she finds them trashy and has a negative association because of her sister's exes. The boyfriend, on the other hand, wants to do it to support a friend, which seems like a personal choice. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nShe made her stance clear when they first met, so he should have known. If he's aware of her feelings and still wants to proceed, maybe that's his choice. But does she have the right to ask him not to? Since they are in a relationship, there's an expectation of some level of compromise. However, personal autonomy is important too. The boyfriend might feel that his autonomy is being restricted if he can't make this decision for himself despite her opinion. But she's not forcing him; she's expressing her feelings, and he's choosing to go against her wishes, which could lead to conflict.\n\nThe author might be seen as in the wrong if she's being controlling, as he pointed out. But if she's honest about her feelings and he's unwilling to respect that, maybe he's being unreasonable. The fact that he's doing it to support a friend adds another layer. It's a personal choice for him, but she's not happy with it. The question is whether her communication was sufficient and whether his reaction was appropriate.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a balance between personal freedom and respecting each other's feelings. If she's communicated her discomfort and he still goes ahead, maybe that's his choice, but he shouldn't call her controlling without understanding her perspective. However, if her disapproval is based on stereotypes and not a genuine concern for his well-being, that could be an issue. The author's justification includes her personal dislike and negative associations, which are valid feelings, even if they're not universally applicable.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a tough call. She's expressing her feelings, which is okay, but if she's using that to pressure him not to do something he wants to do, that's where it could go wrong. But since she's not forcing him, just expressing her feelings, maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of getting angry and calling her controlling might be the real issue here. He should respect her feelings even if he disagrees. Therefore, the answer might be B (she's not in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
