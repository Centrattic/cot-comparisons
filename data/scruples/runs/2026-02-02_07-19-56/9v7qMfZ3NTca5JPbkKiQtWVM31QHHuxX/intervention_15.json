When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the author is against it because she finds body modifications trashy. She made her stance clear when they met. Now the boyfriend wants to do it as solidarity with a friend who just got sober. He got mad and called her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author overstepped. She communicated her feelings from the start, so the boyfriend should have known. But maybe he thought he could change her mind or that it's important enough. On the other hand, the boyfriend getting upset because she's against it might be overreacting. But body modifications are a personal choice. However, the author is in a relationship, so there's a balance between personal freedom and respecting a partner's feelings.\n\nIs it controlling? If she's pressuring him not to do it without considering his feelings, maybe. But she did express her dislike before dating him, so he should have considered that. However, he's choosing to get gauges for a meaningful reason (friend's sobriety), which might be a valid personal choice. The key is whether her objection is reasonable. She's not forcing him, just expressing her dislike and not wanting him to get them. But if he feels she's controlling, that's a problem. But maybe she's not wrong if she's honest about her feelings and he's choosing to ignore them. However, in a healthy relationship, both should respect each other's boundaries. If she's not forcing him, but just stating her preference, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's making it a deal-breaker without considering his perspective, perhaps she is. Hmm. I need to decide between A and B. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The boyfriend's reason is for a friend's sobriety, which might be a personal milestone. The author's discomfort is valid, but she should respect his choice. But she made her feelings known. Maybe she's not wrong to express her feelings, but if he takes it as control, that's on him. But maybe she's wrong if she's not willing to accept his decision once it's made. The answer might depend on context. Since the boyfriend got mad and called her controlling, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she communicated her feelings and he's making a choice that disregards her boundaries. But if the boyfriend is free to choose despite her dislike, maybe she's not wrong. Alternatively, if the boyfriend is being unreasonable, she's not wrong. So leaning towards B.\n"
