When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get gauges, but the girlfriend doesn't like body modifications and finds them trashy. She made her feelings clear from the start, and now he's upset and called her controlling. She's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The girlfriend expressed her dislike for body mods when they met, which is important. The boyfriend is now wanting to get gauges for a friend's sobriety. The girlfriend's objection is based on her personal preference and associations, not his safety or health.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he's doing it for a friend's support, which is a personal choice. However, the girlfriend's stance is that she's not okay with it because she finds it trashy. The issue is whether her objection is valid given that she's communicated it, or if he's within his rights to make his own choices despite her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. The girlfriend made her feelings known, so the boyfriend should have considered that. However, body modifications are a personal choice, and the boyfriend might feel his autonomy is being questioned. The line between respecting each other's preferences and being controlling can be blurry here.\n\nThe girlfriend isn't forcing him not to get the gauges, but she's expressing her dislike and possibly not wanting to be in the relationship if he goes through with it. That's a significant consequence. On the other hand, if the boyfriend values his friend's support and sees this as meaningful, the girlfriend's reaction could be seen as overstepping if it's purely about her preferences.\n\nBut, since she communicated her feelings from the start, the boyfriend should have been aware. If he's still going ahead despite knowing her feelings, maybe he's being inconsiderate. However, he's also making a choice about his own body. The key is whether her objection is controlling or a legitimate expression of her preferences.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether respecting her boundaries is more important than his personal choice. If she's not forcing him but expressing her feelings, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling might be the issue here. So the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
