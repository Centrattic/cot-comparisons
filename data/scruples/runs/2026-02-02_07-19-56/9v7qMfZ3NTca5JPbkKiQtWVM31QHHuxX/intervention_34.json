When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges, but the girlfriend doesn't like them and told him so from the start. Now he's upset and called her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend made her stance clear about not liking body modifications, which she associates with certain negative stereotypes. The boyfriend, after three years of knowing this, wants to get gauges to support his friend who's celebrating sobriety. He feels she's being controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: communication beforehand, the reason behind the boyfriend's decision, and the girlfriend's reaction. The girlfriend did communicate her preferences early on, which is a good practice. The boyfriend, however, decided to go against that after three years. His reason is a positive one\u2014supporting a friend's milestone. But he might have thought about her feelings again. On the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because he's ignoring her stated dislike, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nIs it wrong for her to express her dislike and not want him to get gauges? She made her position clear, so she's not being controlling by voicing her opinion. However, if she's using that to pressure him into not making his own choice, that could be an issue. But in this case, she's expressing her feelings, not necessarily controlling. The boyfriend's reaction of getting angry and calling her controlling might be an overreaction, especially if he didn't consider her feelings despite his own choice.\n\nBut the question is whether the author (girlfriend) is in the wrong. If she's within her right to express her feelings and he's the one choosing to proceed despite her clear communication, then she might not be in the wrong. However, if she's using her influence to control his decisions without mutual discussion, that's different. The story says she told him she hates it, and he went ahead anyway. She's not forcing him; he's making a choice she disagrees with. So she's not in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but maybe the boyfriend's reaction is the issue. However, the question is about her being in the wrong. Since she communicated her feelings and he chose to proceed, she's not controlling him. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
