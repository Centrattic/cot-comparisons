When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that the boyfriend wants to get gauges as a show of solidarity with a friend who's celebrating sobriety. The author made it clear she doesn't like body mods and finds them trashy. The boyfriend got angry and called her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had previously communicated her dislike for body modifications, so the boyfriend wasn't unaware. However, he's choosing to get gauges now, which is a personal decision. The author is upset because she finds them trashy and it reminds her of negative associations. \n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. In a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author expressed her feelings beforehand, so she's not being controlling out of nowhere. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is making a personal choice that affects their relationship. \n\nIs it fair for the author to ask him not to do it? Well, she has a right to express her preferences, but if he's willing to proceed despite her feelings, there could be a conflict. However, the author isn't forcing him; she's expressing her opinion and perhaps her discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling is problematic because he's choosing to go against her stated preferences. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't forcing him to not get gauges, just expressing her dislike. However, if he's determined to do it, the issue becomes about whether her feelings are valid. The boyfriend's decision to proceed might be seen as dismissive of her feelings, which he was aware of. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her feelings and is standing by them. The boyfriend's choice to go ahead despite her objections might be where the fault lies. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
