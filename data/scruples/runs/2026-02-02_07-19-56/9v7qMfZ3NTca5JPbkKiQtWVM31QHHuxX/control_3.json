When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges, and the girlfriend is opposed to it. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend made her stance clear from the start of the relationship. She told him she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating for three years, and he hasn't done anything until now. The boyfriend's reason here is to support his friend who is celebrating sobriety, which he sees as meaningful. \n\nSo the key points are: the girlfriend communicated her dislike early on, the boyfriend is acting on a personal reason (supporting a friend), and the conflict arises because the boyfriend is pushing back against her feelings. The girlfriend now feels like the relationship might not work because he's ignoring her boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Well, she expressed her preferences upfront. That's important because in a relationship, communication is key. However, the boyfriend is making a decision that affects both of them. Even though she voiced her opinion, the boyfriend is choosing to take an action that she finds objectionable. \n\nBut wait, is it wrong for her to not want him to get gauges? She's not forcing him to do anything; she's asking him not to. But he's choosing to go against her wishes. The boyfriend might see this as a personal choice, which he has a right to, but the girlfriend might see it as a sign of disrespect. \n\nIs he being controlling by getting the gauges despite her feelings? Or is she being controlling by trying to influence his decision? The line here is tricky. Since she communicated her preferences, but he has his own reasons, it's a conflict between personal autonomy and respecting the partner's feelings. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should consider each other's feelings. If the boyfriend is willing to do something that she really dislikes, even after she expressed it clearly, that could indicate a problem in considering her boundaries. However, the boyfriend also has the right to make his own decisions. \n\nThe girlfriend is not forcing him to avoid gauges, but she's upset because he's going against her wishes. The boyfriend is upset that she's trying to control his choices. So who's in the wrong? It might depend on the balance of respect in the relationship. If the boyfriend is making a choice that's important to him but disregards her feelings, that's a problem. On the other hand, if the girlfriend hasn't considered his reasons and is being overly controlling, that's also an issue. \n\nIn this case, the boyfriend's reason is to support a friend's sobriety, which seems legitimate. However, the girlfriend's dislike is based on personal preferences and associations. The boyfriend should have discussed this with her before deciding, but since he did, and she still opposes it, it's a matter of whether he's willing to honor her feelings or not. \n\nThe girlfriend is not in the wrong if she's been clear and is making a request based on her preferences. However, if the boyfriend respects her, he should consider her feelings. Since he went ahead anyway, maybe he's in the wrong. But the question is about the author (the girlfriend) being in the wrong. If she's standing by her request and the boyfriend is ignoring it, she might not be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the boyfriend is within his rights to make his own choice, maybe she's overstepping. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's request is reasonable and if the boyfriend is respecting both his own and her desires. Since the girlfriend has communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend is choosing to act despite that, it could be seen as him being in the wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
