When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Alright, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend wanting to get gauges despite the author's clear dislike for body modifications. \n\nFirst, the author made her feelings known from the start of the relationship, emphasizing she finds body mods trashy. The boyfriend, after three years, wants to get gauges to support a friend who's sober. The key here is that he's doing it for a friend's milestone, not just for himself.\n\nNow, the author is conflicted because she's against body mods, but the boyfriend feels she's being controlling. The question is whether her stance is justified. On one hand, she communicated her preferences early, which is important in a relationship. On the other, the boyfriend is doing something meaningful to someone else, which could be seen as his personal choice. \n\nControl in a relationship often involves respecting each other's autonomy unless there's a valid reason to be concerned. The author's dislike is personal and based on associations, not on the boyfriend's behavior. The boyfriend's decision isn't harmful, just different. So, while the author has the right to her preferences, pushing back when he's making a choice for a positive reason might cross into being controlling. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his choice despite her feelings.\n"
