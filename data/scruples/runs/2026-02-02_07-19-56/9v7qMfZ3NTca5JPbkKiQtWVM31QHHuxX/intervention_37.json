When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the girlfriend not wanting him to because she thinks it's trashy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman made her dislike for body modifications clear from the start. They've been dating for three years, and he's never done anything like that. Now he wants to get gauges to support his friend who's sober. She feels it's trashy and associated with people she doesn't like. He got mad and called her controlling.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to analyze. In relationships, it's important that both partners can express their preferences, but also respect each other's autonomy. She communicated her feelings early on, which is good. But when it comes to his own body, he has the right to make his own choices. Her reaction might be seen as controlling if she's trying to impose her views on him. However, he did know her stance beforehand. Maybe she's not wrong for not wanting him to get gauges, but she might have overreacted or not respected his decision once he made it. On the other hand, he should consider her feelings if he had known she'd react this strongly. But since he's choosing to do it for himself, even though she's not happy, he might have a right to his choice. \n\nThe line between personal choice and controlling behavior can be thin. If she's not trying to stop him from doing it but is expressing her dislike, that's different. But if she's pressuring him or making him feel bad for going ahead, then it's a problem. The boyfriend's anger might be because he felt his autonomy was being challenged. \n\nIn this case, she mentioned she's considering ending the relationship because he's doing it despite her feelings. That's a significant consequence. If he's respecting her feelings but still choosing to proceed, maybe she's overstepping by holding it against him. However, if he didn't consider her feelings when making the decision, maybe that's his fault too. \n\nI think the key here is whether she had the right to express her dislike and whether he overstepped by getting angry and calling her controlling. Since he's making a choice about his own body, and she had communicated her feelings early on, she isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting him to do it. However, if she's trying to control his decisions, that's where she might be wrong. But in this case, it seems like she's expressing her opinion, not forcing him. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But the boyfriend's reaction might be part of the problem too. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. On one hand, personal autonomy is important. On the other, respecting each other's feelings matters. The answer could depend on how they communicated and followed through. The woman's stance is based on her personal preferences, which is valid, but she might not have the right to demand him not to do something. So if she's not trying to stop him but is just expressing her dislike, she's not in the wrong. But if she's making him feel like he can't do it because of her preferences, that's more controlling. The situation is a bit nuanced, but I think the answer is B: No, she's not in the wrong because she expressed her feelings clearly, and he chose to go against them. However, the boyfriend's reaction might be part of the issue.\n"
