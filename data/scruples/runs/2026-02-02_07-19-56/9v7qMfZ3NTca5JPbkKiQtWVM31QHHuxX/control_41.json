When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that the boyfriend, who's 26, is planning to get ear gauges as a way to support his friend's sobriety. The author, a 25-year-old woman, has expressed dislike for body modifications because they remind her of \"scumbag\" types her sister dated. The boyfriend got upset, called her controlling, and now she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal boundaries, respect, and whether expressing a preference about a partner's body choices is controlling. First, I need to assess if her actions cross into being controlling. She made her stance clear when they met and they were both okay with it for three years. Now, he wants to get gauges for a specific reason\u2014supporting a friend's milestone. She's against it and now he's mad.\n\nBody modifications are a personal choice, and as long as they're not harmful or affecting her directly, she shouldn't dictate that. The fact that she's basing her dislike on stereotypes (linking body mods to \"scumbag\" types) might be a red flag. Also, the boyfriend's reason is about solidarity, which is his personal decision. If she's only now bringing this up, even if she mentioned it before, maybe she's being inconsistent. But she did mention it from the start. However, people can change their preferences, and the boyfriend might have thought he could revisit the topic after they were together so long.\n\nBut she's not forcing him to do anything; she's just expressing her dislike. However, if he perceives it as a demand he shouldn't do it, that's a conflict. The key is whether her objection is about her own values or trying to control him. Since it's her personal opinion and she's not making him do anything, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the boyfriend's reaction suggests he feels controlled, which might indicate that her communication wasn't about personal preference but about expecting him to comply.\n\nAlso, considering the reason for the gauges\u2014supporting a friend's sobriety\u2014this might be important to him. If her refusal to accept this is causing significant conflict, it might be an issue in the relationship. But the question is if she's in the wrong. I think it's more about their communication styles. She's not wrong for having her own preferences, but if she's using them to pressure him into not getting gauges, that's a problem. The fact that they've been together three years and he's now making a choice that she dislikes might be a test of their relationship dynamics. The answer would likely be B (No), because she's not in the wrong for having her own feelings, but they need to communicate better to reach a mutual understanding without control.\n"
