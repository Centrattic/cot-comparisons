When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that the boyfriend wants to get gauges as a solidarity gesture for a friend's sobriety. The author has made her dislike clear before, and now he's upset, calling her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been up front about her feelings towards body mods. She's been in the relationship for three years, and this is a new request. The boyfriend's reasoning is about a friend's milestone, which is significant. But the author feels that this is against her preferences, and now he's upset with her.\n\nIs she being controlling? Well, he knew her stance before they started dating. If he respected her boundaries, he might not have done this. But maybe she's overstepping by trying to influence his body modifications. However, body modifications can be a personal choice, and if one partner has a strong aversion, that's a valid feeling. The key here is communication. Did she make her feelings known beforehand? Yes, but maybe she should have discussed it again if there's a conflict of values.\n\nBut the boyfriend's argument is that he wants to support his friend, which seems like a personal decision. If the author is against it, is it fair to ask him not to? It's a matter of personal freedom versus respecting a partner's feelings. The line between being supportive and controlling can be thin. If she's not okay with it, maybe that's a dealbreaker for her, but if he feels she's imposing her views, that's a problem.\n\nThe community's response to AITA posts often looks at whether there's a history of respecting each other's boundaries. Here, the author communicated her stance early on. The boyfriend is now making a choice that conflicts with her preferences. If she's considering breaking up because he chose to go against her wishes, that suggests she values her boundaries highly. However, the boyfriend's actions might also be a matter of personal expression. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's feelings are a reasonable expression of her preferences, and the boyfriend's actions are a reasonable personal choice. Since both have valid points, but the author made her stance clear, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, the boyfriend's reaction could be seen as a misstep. The community might side with her because she communicated her feelings, but it's a close call. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
