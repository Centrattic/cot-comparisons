When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the girlfriend not liking it because she finds them trashy. The boyfriend got mad and called her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned she made her stance clear from the start they were dating. She's been consistent for three years. Now the boyfriend wants to get gauges despite her feelings. She's upset because it reminds her of her sister's exes, which is a personal feeling.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The boyfriend knew her feelings but still wants to proceed. However, getting a gauge is a personal choice and a form of self-expression. The girlfriend is expressing her dislike, which is valid, but the boyfriend's decision to get it is his choice. \n\nBut, the girlfriend might be overstepping if she's pressuring him not to do it without considering his reasons. The boyfriend's reason is to support a friend's sobriety, which seems genuine. The girlfriend's reaction leading to the boyfriend feeling controlled could be an issue. \n\nHowever, the original question is whether the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. If she communicated her feelings and the boyfriend chooses to go against that, maybe it's not her fault. But if she's being controlling by trying to influence his decision against his will, then she's in the wrong. \n\nBut the boyfriend's anger at her for expressing her opinion might be the problem too. People have different values, and if she's not forcing him but just expressing her dislike, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling suggests he might not be respecting her feelings. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the girlfriend is trying to control him or just expressing her opinion. Since she made it clear and he chose to go against it, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him, then she is. The scenario says she told him she hates it, but he still wants to do it. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she's stating her feelings, and he's making his choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
