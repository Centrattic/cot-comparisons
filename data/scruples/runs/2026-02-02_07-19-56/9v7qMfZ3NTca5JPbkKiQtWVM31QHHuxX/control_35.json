When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges.\n\nFirst, the key points: The boyfriend is 26, they've been dating three years. She's made it clear she doesn't like body mods because she finds them trashy. Now he wants to get gauges for a friend's sobriety, which she objects to, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. She expressed her feelings early on, which is good. However, he's now making a personal choice that she's uncomfortable with. But why is she upset? She's not pressuring him to change his body, but the act of him getting gauges is causing her distress. \n\nBody modifications are personal choices. Even if she doesn't like them, if he's an adult, he has the right to make decisions about his body. But relationships require mutual respect. She communicated her dislike, which is valid, but if he's willing to proceed despite that, is she overstepping? \n\nOn the other hand, he's making a choice that might affect her feelings. They need to find a middle ground. She's not saying to stop being friends with the friend or to not celebrate sobriety, just the gauges. But if he's doing it for solidarity, maybe there's another way to show support without a body mod.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling is problematic. Dismissing her feelings as controlling when she's expressed her preferences could indicate a lack of empathy on his part. However, she's not forbidding him; she's expressing her dislike. The line between communication and control can be blurry here.\n\nIn terms of fault, it's a two-way street. She's not wrong for having her feelings, but if she's not respecting his autonomy, that's an issue. However, since she's made her stance clear and he's choosing to go against her wishes, perhaps the fault isn't entirely hers. But the main question is if she's in the wrong. \n\nSince she's not forcing him to change his body, but rather expressing her discomfort, and he's choosing to proceed, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if the relationship requires mutual compromise, and she's not willing to accept his decision, that could be an issue. But the core of the problem is his reaction and her feelings about his decision. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether expressing a dislike for something that the partner wants to do counts as being controlling. If the boyfriend is making a choice that she's uncomfortable with, but it's his body, then she's not in the wrong for voicing her feelings. However, if the relationship requires compromise, and he's unwilling to find a solution that respects her feelings, that's on him. So the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but the boyfriend's reaction might be the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
