When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The situation is that the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges to support a friend who's sober, but the author really dislikes body modifications because she finds them trashy. She made her stance clear early in their relationship, but now he's pushing through despite her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author communicated her dislike of body mods from the start. The boyfriend, who previously had none, is now considering getting them. The key point here is whether the boyfriend's actions are a personal choice that the author has a right to object to, or if it's something that should be respected despite her disapproval.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to express her feelings and preferences. If she made her stance clear, it's reasonable for her to feel upset if he goes against that. However, body modifications are a personal choice, and as the relationship has progressed, the boyfriend may feel that he has the autonomy to make such a decision, especially for a reason like supporting a friend's sobriety.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014getting mad and calling her controlling\u2014might indicate that he feels his autonomy is being restricted. The author is in a dilemma because she's not sure if continuing the relationship is right if he doesn't respect her feelings. But is she actually in the wrong? It's a matter of balancing personal boundaries versus personal freedom. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's preferences and boundaries is crucial. If the author communicated her dislike clearly and the boyfriend proceeds anyway, that could be seen as dismissing her feelings. However, the boyfriend's action is his personal choice, which might not be inherently wrong. The question is whether the author overstepped by trying to influence his decision. Since she expressed her opinion and it's her personal dislike, but it's about his body, it's a gray area. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or societal norms. Some might say she's not in the wrong because she's expressing her feelings, while others might argue that he's entitled to his own choices. The key is whether there was mutual respect. If the author is trying to control his decisions, that's a problem. But if she's just communicating her feelings without forcing him, she's not necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's reaction could be a larger issue in the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because it's about personal choice and she expressed her feelings. However, there's a nuance because the boyfriend's action is his own, but the author's concern is valid. The main issue is the boyfriend's reaction, not her expressing her opinion.\n"
