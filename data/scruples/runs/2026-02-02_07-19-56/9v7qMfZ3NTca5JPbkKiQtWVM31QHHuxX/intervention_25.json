When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend wanting to get ear gauges as a gesture for his sober friend, but she's against it because she finds them trashy and associated with people her sister dated. She made her stance clear when they met, and now he's upset, calling her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author communicated her dislike for body modifications early on. That's important because she set boundaries. But now, after three years, her boyfriend wants to get something that she still dislikes. The key here is whether she's overstepping by asking him not to do it. \n\nThe boyfriend's motivation is a positive one\u2014supporting a friend's sobriety. The author's objection seems personal and not based on harm to him. However, she's expressing her own values and preferences. In a relationship, respecting each other's desires is crucial. If she's been clear about her feelings, it's reasonable for him to be hurt or upset, but does that mean she's in the wrong?\n\nThe argument could be made that personal choices like body piercings are individual and shouldn't be controlled by a partner unless there's a mutual agreement. But the author isn't forcing him; she's asking. The boyfriend might see it as controlling if she's pressuring him to conform. On the other hand, the author might feel that her partner isn't respecting her feelings after she's set boundaries. \n\nI should also consider the boyfriend's reaction. If he's getting angry and calling her controlling without considering her reasoning, maybe he's being dismissive of her feelings. But the question is about the author. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to assess if her request is reasonable. Since body modifications are a personal choice and not harmful, unless they have a mutual agreement, she might be infringing on his autonomy. However, she's not making him do it; she's just expressing her dislike and asking him not to. \n\nBut the boyfriend is making a personal choice for a good reason, so if the author is still against it despite being clear, maybe she's being controlling by not respecting his choice. Alternatively, if the boyfriend knew her stance and still chooses to proceed, perhaps he's being disrespectful of her feelings. The answer might depend on whether the author is trying to control him or just expressing her preferences. \n\nIn relationships, partners should have space for personal expression unless it directly affects the other in a harmful way. Gauges are a personal style choice. If the author is okay with him not having body mods before, but now he's doing it for a friend, maybe she's being inconsistent. But she's clear on her dislike, and the boyfriend is choosing to go against that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's not forcing him, just expressing her feelings, maybe not. But if she's pressuring him and making him feel guilty for his choice, then she might be. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. He's angry and calls her controlling, which is a strong accusation. The author's stance was communicated, and the boyfriend is choosing to honor his friend's milestone. The question is whether the author's request is a form of control. Since she's not making him do something but is asking him to respect her feelings, maybe she's not in the wrong. Or is she overstepping by wanting to influence his decision? \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The answer depends on the context of their relationship. If they've had agreements about body mods and this was a mutual understanding, then the boyfriend might be going beyond that. But if the author only expressed her dislike and didn't set a rule, the boyfriend's decision is his own. The author isn't in the wrong for having her opinion and asking, but she could be if she's exerting control. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be the controlling part by not respecting her feelings. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
