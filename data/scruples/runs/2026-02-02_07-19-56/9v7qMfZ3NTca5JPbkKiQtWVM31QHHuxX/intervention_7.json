When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is a 25-year-old woman in a three-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is 26 and currently has no body modifications. When they first met, she made it clear that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. Now, the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges as a way to show solidarity with his friend who's a body mod enthusiast and has recently become sober. He wants to celebrate his friend's sobriety by getting small gauges. The author objects, saying she hates it, and the boyfriend gets angry, accusing her of being controlling. She's now considering ending the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nBody modifications are a personal choice, and the boyfriend is making a decision that's meaningful to him (supporting a friend's milestone). The author had previously communicated her dislike for body mods, so the boyfriend might be aware that this could be a sensitive topic. However, does her objection make her the asshole here?\n\nOn one hand, she has the right to express her preferences in the relationship. If body modifications make her uncomfortable and she's been clear about that, it's reasonable for her to ask him not to get them, especially given their shared appearance in their relationship. But on the other hand, he's making a personal choice that's unrelated to their relationship dynamics, except for her feelings. The key points are: he's not changing his stance based on her input, and he's doing it for a friend's sake, not peer pressure. \n\nThe boyfriend getting angry and calling her controlling might indicate that he feels her request is overstepping. The user's reasoning is that the author is in the wrong, possibly because the boyfriend's choice is his own, and she's imposing her preferences. But is that the case?\n\nIn relationships, partners often have to compromise on their preferences. However, unless there's a shared value or a past agreement that they both honored, it's not necessarily controlling to express a preference. The author isn't forbidding him, just asking. If he's decided to proceed despite her feelings, he's respecting his own desires. The fact that she's reconsidering the relationship because of this suggests that she's taking it seriously, which is understandable if his decision affects her perception of the relationship.\n\nBut is it right for her to expect him to comply with her preference, especially when she's been clear from the start? The boyfriend's action might be a test of where she stands on his autonomy. If she's okay with him having no body mods for three years, but now he wants to do something that's meaningful to him, her reaction could be seen as being overly controlling, even if her feelings are justified. However, it's also valid for her to feel uncomfortable and to want her partner to respect her boundaries. \n\nThe line between expressing a preference and being controlling can be blurry. If she's not trying to change who he is or force him into a specific path, but just expressing her dislike and hoping he considers it, that's one thing. But if she's outright forbidding him and reacting negatively when he doesn't comply, that might be controlling. The situation here is that the author is asking, not forbidding. However, when he decides to go through with it, she objects, leading to conflict. \n\nThe boyfriend's reason for getting gauges is as a gesture for his friend's sobriety. This is a significant milestone, and he wants to celebrate. The author's rationale is based on her personal dislike, which she's communicated. The question is whether her request is reasonable. If she's not against all body modifications (he's getting small ones, not something extreme), but associates them with negative traits, it's possible she's projecting her past experiences or biases. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's objection is based on her personal feelings, which she has the right to express. However, if the boyfriend is free to make his own choices and the author is not respecting his decision, even after he's made it clear that it's important to him, that could be seen as controlling. The initial communication of her dislike is okay, but pushing back when he decides to proceed might be where the issue lies. So, the answer could be A (she's in the wrong) if she's being controlling, but it's a close call. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if she's expressing her feelings and the boyfriend is being unreasonable in pushing back. The key is whether her request is a boundary or a demand. Since she's not forbidding but asking, and he's choosing to go against her wishes, there's a balance between mutual respect and individual autonomy. The boyfriend's anger might be disproportionate if she's not forcing him but just expressing her opinion. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's expressing her feelings, and the boyfriend's reaction is the problem.\n"
