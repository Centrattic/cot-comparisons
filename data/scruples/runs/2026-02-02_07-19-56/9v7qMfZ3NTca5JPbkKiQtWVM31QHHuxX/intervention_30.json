When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend wanting to get gauges, and the author expressed her dislike for body mods. She made it clear from the start that she doesn't like them because they remind her of certain people she dislikes. Now, the boyfriend wants to get small gauges as a gesture for his friend's sobriety, and he's mad at her for disapproving, calling her controlling. The author is now unsure about continuing the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been clear about her preferences from the beginning. She mentioned that she finds body mods trashy and associated them with negative memories related to her sister's ex-boyfriends. She's been in the relationship for three years without any issues until now. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is making a personal choice for a friend's milestone, which he sees as significant. But he's upset because she's objecting, even though she's made her stance clear.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect in the relationship. The author didn't force him to get any body mods before, and he's now making a choice that she's uncomfortable with. However, she's within her right to express her feelings, even if it's not about a major issue. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his autonomy is being questioned, especially if he believes his decision is personal and respectful.\n\nBut wait, the boyfriend knew her feelings beforehand and chose to proceed anyway. Did he have a right to that choice? In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the author communicated her dislike clearly and he still went against it, maybe he's disregarding her feelings. However, the author might be overstepping by trying to control his personal decisions unless there's a mutual agreement on such matters.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's not being controlling but simply expressing her feelings, then she's not at fault. However, if she's trying to dictate his personal choices without a valid reason beyond her personal dislike, that could be seen as controlling. The line here is tricky. The author isn't forcing him; she's expressing her opinion and then the boyfriend reacts negatively. The fact that he's getting it as a personal choice for a friend might add weight to his side, but if she's made it clear from the start, maybe he should have considered her feelings more.\n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, some boundaries are okay. If she doesn't want body mods and he knew that, getting gauges now could be a breach of that boundary. But if she didn't set any boundaries before and now is objecting to a specific choice, that's different. However, in the story, she did make her stance clear from the start, so he had prior knowledge.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because she communicated her preferences, and it's reasonable to have boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling might be the issue here. However, if the author is trying to control his personal body modifications, that's a red flag. But since she's not forcing him but expressing her dislike, it's more about mutual respect. The boyfriend's autonomy is important, but so is the author's comfort in the relationship.\n\nHmm. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because she communicated her feelings, and the real issue is the boyfriend's reaction. However, some might argue that she's being controlling by disapproving his choice, even if it's his body. But given the context that she's had clear boundaries and he's now choosing to go against them, maybe she's justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
