When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend is 26, the author is 25. They've been dating for three years. From the start, the author made it clear she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them \"trashy.\" She associates them with negative stereotypes, like scumbag types her sister dated. Now, the boyfriend wants to get gauges as a solidarity gesture for his friend who's celebrating sobriety. The author objects, and the boyfriend feels controlled, leading to relationship tension.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author communicated her dislike early on, the boyfriend is going against her wishes, and the conflict is about whether she's being controlling.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author has the right to her preferences, but in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy. Body modifications are personal choices, and while the author expressed her dislike, the boyfriend might feel his own choice is being restricted. However, the author's stance was clear from the beginning. Now, the boyfriend is considering something that the author explicitly doesn't like. \n\nIs it controlling to express a preference that one doesn't like body modifications, especially if it's been communicated? Or is the boyfriend overreacting by feeling controlled when it's a new decision not made in the relationship's early stages?\n\nAlso, the boyfriend's reason for getting gauges is to support a friend's sobriety. That adds context\u2014maybe he sees it as meaningful. The author's concern is based on stereotypes, which she acknowledges aren't universally true. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's being controlling, that's an issue. But if she's respecting her own boundaries and communicated them, maybe she's not. However, in a relationship, partners should have some autonomy. The author might be overstepping by trying to influence this decision now, even if she communicated her dislike before. Because once a relationship is established, each partner has the right to make personal choices unless there's a mutual agreement. \n\nSo, if the author never explicitly agreed to not having body mods, the boyfriend's decision might be within his rights. The author's disapproval could be seen as trying to control his choices, hence making her the AITA. But if she made it clear from the start and he's now going against that, maybe he's the one in the wrong. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The fact that she communicated her dislike but he's now making a choice that goes against her preferences could mean she's in the wrong if she's pressuring him not to do it. However, if she's just expressing her opinion without forcing him to comply, maybe it's his choice. The problem is the boyfriend took offense and felt controlled, which might be valid if the author is using the relationship dynamics to influence his decision. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because even if she communicated her dislike, the boyfriend's choice to get gauges is his own. The author shouldn't impose her preferences to the point of making him feel controlled. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she's just stating her feelings. It's tricky. I think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because she's trying to control her partner's body modification decision despite his reasons, even if she communicated her dislike early on.\n"
