When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The boyfriend wanted to get them as a gesture for his friend who's sober. The author doesn't like body mods and finds them trashy, which made her boyfriend angry, calling her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had previously stated her dislike for body modifications when they met. The boyfriend didn't have any mods then, and she made her feelings clear. Now, after three years, he wants to get gauges. Is he respecting her boundaries by going through with it despite her objections? Or is she being controlling by not supporting his decision for a meaningful reason?\n\nBody modification is a personal choice. The boyfriend's reasoning here is about solidarity with a friend who's achieved sobriety, which is a positive event. He's not doing it to spite her but as a meaningful gesture. The author's dislike is based on her personal preferences and past experiences, which is valid. However, she's in a relationship where both partners' preferences need to be considered. \n\nThe boyfriend got angry and called her controlling. That suggests that he might feel her disapproval is infringing on his autonomy. She might feel that he's ignoring her boundaries. The key here is whether she has the right to influence his personal choices, especially when she had already made her stance clear. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal autonomy with mutual respect. If the boyfriend is making a significant change to his body for a meaningful reason, the author's opposition might be seen as controlling if she's not allowing him to make that choice. However, if she's been clear about her values and the decision is a big deal for her, she's not entirely wrong either. \n\nBut since the boyfriend is making a personal choice for a positive reason, and the author is trying to prevent it based on her dislike, it's more about his autonomy versus her comfort. Unless the gauges would affect her in a negative way beyond personal preference (like if she's repulsed or it affects their relationship dynamics beyond aesthetics), she might be overstepping. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but wait, maybe not. Wait, some might argue that she's in the wrong because she's imposing her preferences on her partner's body. Others might say she's within her right to express her feelings, but the boyfriend should consider her feelings. However, if he's making a meaningful choice, she shouldn't have the authority to stop him. The main issue is whether she's being controlling. If she's not forcing him but expressing her dislike, it's different. But if she's pressuring him not to do it, then maybe she is. The post says she \"asked\" him not to, which is different from controlling. However, his reaction being anger and calling her controlling suggests that he felt she was overstepping. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit nuanced. If she's only expressing her dislike without trying to control his actions, she's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him not to do it despite his own reasons, then maybe she is. The key is whether she's respecting his autonomy. Since she asked, and he chose to go ahead, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, the fact that she had a strong reaction based on personal preferences might make some think she is. But given the context, I think the answer is B (No), because it's his body and his choice, and she's not forcing him, just expressing her dislike. However, the boyfriend's anger might indicate he feels it's his decision. So the answer is B.\n"
