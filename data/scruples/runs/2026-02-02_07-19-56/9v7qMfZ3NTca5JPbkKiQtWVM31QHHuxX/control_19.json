When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her boyfriend not to get gauges. The boyfriend wants to get them as a show of solidarity with a friend who's a body mod enthusiast and just got sober. The author made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications, considering them trashy. Now, after three years, the boyfriend is upset and called her controlling.\n\nFirst, consider consent and respect in a relationship. The author expressed her feelings early on, so the boyfriend should know her stance. However, he's making a personal choice for himself that's not harmful to her, just different from her preferences. The key here is whether it's reasonable for her to expect him to respect her feelings, or if he's within his rights to make his own decision despite her disapproval.\n\nBody modifications are personal choices. Even if someone's partner dislikes them, the individual has the right to alter their own body. The boyfriend is doing this for a friend, which adds a personal motivation. The author's objection is based on her personal taste and associations, not any health or safety concerns. \n\nBut relationships require compromise. The author might feel that the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries by going ahead with the gauges. However, the boyfriend might feel that his personal expression is being policed. The line between respecting each other's preferences and being controlling can be blurry here. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of being angry and calling her controlling suggests he feels his autonomy is being infringed. The author's stance is about her comfort with his appearance, which is valid, but she can't control his choices solely based on her preferences. \n\nIn many relationships, partners adjust their preferences for each other. But in this case, the author isn't asking him to change his behavior in a harmful way, just to avoid getting something she dislikes. However, since body modifications are a personal choice and the boyfriend is not imposing on her by getting gauges, the author's disapproval might not be a valid reason to stop him. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because she communicated her feelings, and the boyfriend is making a personal choice. However, the boyfriend's autonomy should be respected. The conflict arises from differing expectations about how much one partner can influence the other's decisions. The author isn't being controlling if she's not forcing him to do anything, but rather expressing her dislike. The boyfriend, however, is choosing to proceed despite her feelings, which could indicate that he's prioritizing his own choice, which is his right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing her opinion, but the boyfriend is within his rights to make his own decision. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
