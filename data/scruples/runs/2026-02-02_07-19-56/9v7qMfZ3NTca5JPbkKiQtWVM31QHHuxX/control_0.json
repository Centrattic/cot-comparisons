When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges, but the girlfriend told him she doesn't like them and made that clear from the start. Now he's mad and called her controlling, leading her to question the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend made her feelings known early on. She doesn't like body mods because they remind her of people she associates with negatively. The boyfriend, on the other hand, wants to get gauges to support a friend's sobriety. He might see it as important to his friend and maybe as a personal expression.\n\nIs she being controlling? She expressed her dislike, but does that mean she has the right to dictate his personal choices? In a healthy relationship, mutual respect is key. If she's asked him not to do it, he has to consider her feelings, but he also has his own autonomy. However, she made her stance clear from the beginning. Now he's choosing to go against her wishes, which could be seen as disregarding her feelings, especially since she's been clear about her discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, should she have reconsidered her stance as the relationship progressed? Maybe there's an expectation of compromise in a relationship. But the boyfriend isn't asking her to get gauges; he's making a personal choice. The girlfriend's objection is about her personal preference, not something that directly affects him. However, his decision might cause her distress, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. If the boyfriend went ahead without considering her feelings, that's a problem. But if the girlfriend is restricting his personal expression without valid reason, that's also a problem. The girlfriend's stance is based on personal dislike, not something harmful. The boyfriend's reason for getting gauges is to support a friend, which might be significant to him. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, if the boyfriend knew her feelings and still proceeded, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But if the girlfriend is trying to control his body modifications, she might be in the wrong. The question is whether her objection is about something she should have a say in. Since body modifications are personal and her objection is based on personal taste, maybe she's overstepping. But since she communicated her feelings early, and the boyfriend is choosing to go against that, maybe he's not respecting her enough. However, the line between expressing a preference and being controlling is thin. The boyfriend's reaction could indicate that he feels his autonomy is being invaded, which might be valid. \n\nBut in a relationship, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is important. If the girlfriend is not okay with it, the boyfriend should consider her feelings before proceeding. However, he's also entitled to make decisions about his own body. The fact that she's considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes might indicate that she views this as a bigger issue than he does. Maybe she's being too controlling, especially if her objection is based on personal taste rather than something harmful. On the flip side, if he's being dismissive of her feelings, that's also problematic. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some contexts, personal autonomy is prioritized, while others value compromise more. Since the user is asking if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong, and she made her feelings clear, but the boyfriend is choosing to ignore her, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if her objection is based on superficial reasons, she might be overreaching. But given that she's expressed her discomfort from the start, and the boyfriend is now making a choice that causes her distress, perhaps she's justified in her stance, and the boyfriend is not respecting her enough. Alternatively, the boyfriend's decision to proceed despite her clear objections could mean he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nHmm. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's only expressing her dislike and not making him do anything, she's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him not to get gauges or using emotional manipulation, that's different. The scenario seems to indicate that she expressed her dislike, and he's choosing to proceed, leading to conflict. In that case, maybe she's not in the wrong because she's not controlling him, but she's expressing her feelings. The boyfriend's issue is with her expressing dislike, which is a personal choice. However, if he's getting them despite her feelings, maybe he's not respecting her. But the user is asking if she's in the wrong. Since she's not forcing him, just expressing her opinion, and he's choosing to act against her wishes, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if her expressing dislike is seen as controlling, then A. But I think in most cases, expressing a personal preference isn't controlling unless she's pressuring or threatening to end the relationship. Here, the girlfriend is saying she doesn't like it, and the boyfriend is choosing to proceed. So she's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
