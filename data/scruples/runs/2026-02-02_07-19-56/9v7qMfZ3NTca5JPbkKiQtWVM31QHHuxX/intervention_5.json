When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges, and the girlfriend is against it because she finds them trashy. She made her feelings clear from the start, and they've been dating for three years. Now the boyfriend is upset, calling her controlling, and she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend expressed her dislike for body modifications early on. That's important because it shows she communicated her boundaries. However, relationships also involve mutual respect for each other's choices and growth. The boyfriend wants to get gauges as a gesture of support for his friend's sobriety, which is a personal decision. \n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's stance has been consistent for three years. If he knew her feelings all along and is only now deciding to go against her wishes, maybe there's an issue with his willingness to respect her boundaries. Or maybe he's grown and changed his mind about the topic, which is possible. \n\nHowever, the key here is whether she had an obligation to let him do something she finds offensive. It's his body, so he has the right to modify it. But she's not the one getting it; she's the one who finds it distasteful. The problem is whether her disapproval is a deal-breaker. If he's aware of her feelings and still chooses to proceed, that could be seen as disregarding her feelings. But does that make her right to take it as controlling?\n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that she made her feelings clear, and he's going against that. The boyfriend feels it's a personal choice and that she's being controlling. The line between having a right to one's body and respecting a partner's comfort is blurry here. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If he knew her feelings and still chose to do it, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But at the same time, he's making a personal decision that affects him. The girlfriend might be overstepping by making it a deal-breaker, but maybe not if it's a core value for her. \n\nThere's also the aspect of support. If his friend is important, maybe the gesture is significant to him. However, the girlfriend's discomfort is also valid. But is it her place to dictate his body modifications? That's where the \"controlling\" accusation might come from. \n\nI think the key points are: the girlfriend communicated her dislike early, the boyfriend is going against that, and the girlfriend is now considering leaving because of it. If she's not willing to accept his decision, then perhaps she is in the wrong for not respecting his autonomy. But if his actions are causing her significant distress and he's aware, maybe he's the one in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. On one hand, his body, so he should be allowed. On the other, she's communicated her feelings, and he's not heeding them. But if they can't find a middle ground, maybe the relationship is in trouble. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. If she's not the one getting the gauge, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him not to do it because of her personal taste, maybe she is. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether her disapproval is a legitimate boundary or her personal preference. If she's not okay with it to the point of breaking up the relationship, maybe she is the one with the problem. Alternatively, if he's choosing to ignore her clear boundaries, he's the asshole. But the user thinks she's in the wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (she's not in the wrong) because she communicated her feelings and he's choosing to disregard them, which could be controlling in reverse. But I'm not 100% sure.\n"
