When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend wanting to get ear gauges, which the author dislikes. She had previously told him she doesn't like body modifications because they remind her of \"trashy\" people and her sister's exes. Now, he wants to get gauges to celebrate a friend's sobriety, and he got mad at her for opposing it, calling her controlling.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if that's accurate. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, personal preferences vs. autonomy. The boyfriend is an adult and has the right to make decisions about his own body. The author expressed her dislike before, which he might have considered. However, he's choosing to go ahead with the gauges for a personal reason (friend's sobriety). So, it's about mutual respect here.\n\nThe key points: The author communicated her feelings from the start. The boyfriend, knowing this, decided to proceed. Did she overstep by trying to influence his personal choice? Or is she just expressing her feelings, which he's entitled to respect? \n\nBut wait, when he made a decision that she didn't like, and he got angry, labeling her as controlling. That might be his overreaction. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, partners have different boundaries. If she made her stance clear, and he still proceeds, maybe it's his choice. However, if he felt she was trying to control him, that's a problem. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on her personal dislike, not something harmful. Unless the gauges are a deal-breaker for her, which they might be, leading her to consider ending the relationship. That shows how important her boundary is. \n\nSo, is she wrong? If she's stating her feelings and respecting his autonomy but he's choosing to go against her wishes, she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if she's pressuring him not to get them beyond expressing her dislike, maybe. But in the story, she just expressed her dislike again, leading to conflict. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction (calling her controlling) might be the issue here. The author's stance is about her personal preference, not a moral judgment. So, maybe she isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to be cautious. Maybe the fact that she's now considering ending the relationship because he's going against her wishes suggests that she's making it a deal-breaker, which is her choice. But is that being wrong? No, because it's her right to set boundaries. So, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
