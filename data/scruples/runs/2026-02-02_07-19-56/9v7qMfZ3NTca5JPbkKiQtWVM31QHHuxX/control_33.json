When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she told her boyfriend upfront that she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. They've been dating for three years, and he never got any. Now he wants to get ear gauges to support a friend, but she's against it and he's upset, calling her controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author made her feelings clear from the start, so the boyfriend should have known her stance. However, personal choices like body modifications are part of someone's autonomy. Even if she doesn't like it, is it her place to stop him? Maybe he feels that his autonomy is being challenged.\n\nOn the other hand, he waited three years to do this, which might suggest he's respecting her feelings until now. But if he's doing it for a friend's sake, especially as a celebration of sobriety, is that a valid reason? Maybe he feels it's important to him personally. However, the author's feelings are valid too. She's not forcing him to get it; she's just expressing her dislike and possibly not wanting to support the action.\n\nThe boyfriend getting angry and calling her controlling is a red flag. If he respects her feelings, he might try to find a compromise instead of reacting negatively. But the author is also setting boundaries based on her values. She's not asking to stop him from getting gauges in general, but she's upset because he's going against her expressed preference. \n\nIs it controlling to express a dislike for something that affects their relationship? If they had discussed it and agreed on no body mods, then it's a mutual decision. But here, she made her feelings clear, and he's choosing to go against that. However, he's an adult with his own choices. Maybe she's overstepping by making it a deal-breaker, but his reaction is also extreme.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal autonomy with mutual respect. If her dislike is causing her to consider ending the relationship because he's making a decision she doesn't like, that might indicate deeper issues. But if he's making her feel controlled, that's also a problem. \n\nOverall, the key points are that she communicated her feelings early, he's making a personal choice now, and his reaction is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her feelings, but maybe she's being a bit controlling if she's using this as a reason to end the relationship. However, given the context, I think the boyfriend overreacted, and the author isn't necessarily wrong for having her stance. So the answer is B.\n"
