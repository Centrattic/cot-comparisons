When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend wants to get gauges (ear piercings) as a show of solidarity with his friend who's sober. The author, who's 25, made it clear from the start she doesn't like body modifications because she finds them trashy. Now, after three years of dating, the boyfriend wants to get this piercing, and she's upset. He's mad and called her controlling, and she's considering breaking up because he's doing this despite her dislike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is expressing her feelings and boundaries. She communicated her preferences from the beginning, which is good. Body modifications can be a big deal for some people, and if it's a deal-breaker for her, then she has a right to express that. However, the boyfriend is choosing to get the piercing for a personal reason\u2014supporting a friend's sobriety. That seems like a positive and meaningful reason. \n\nNow, the boyfriend could argue that he's within his rights to make his own choices, even if it upsets his partner. But on the other hand, the author is standing by her boundaries and is worried about ongoing conflict. The key here is whether the author is being controlling or if she's just respecting her own boundaries. The boyfriend might feel that she's being restrictive without valid reasons beyond her personal taste. However, the author isn't asking him to stop being friends with his friend or to not celebrate sobriety; she's just not comfortable with the body mod. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not trying to control him but is genuinely expressing her discomfort and setting her limits, then she's not necessarily at fault. However, if she's using her disapproval as a way to control or manipulate him, then it's different. The boyfriend's anger and calling her controlling suggests he feels she's overstepping. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned it reminds her of her sister's exes adds personal bias to her dislike. That might not be a strong reason for him to comply, especially if he sees it as a personal choice. Relationships require compromise, so maybe she should consider why this is such a big deal. But if she's clear from the start and this is a core value for her, then it's her right to express that. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the boyfriend should have considered her feelings more, but he's doing this for a friend, which he might see as important. However, since they've been in a relationship for three years, he should be aware of her stance. Maybe he's right to push back if he feels his autonomy is being restricted. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether setting boundaries is wrong. In healthy relationships, people should respect each other's boundaries. If the author isn't pressuring him to change but is stating her own stance and considering it a deal-breaker, then she's not in the wrong. But if she's trying to control his decisions, then she might be. The key is the boyfriend's reaction and the context of their communication. Since she made it clear from the start and he chose to ignore her now, maybe she's justified in her stance. But I'm a bit torn because it's about personal choice. So, I'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
