When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the boyfriend wants to get gauges, but the girlfriend has made it clear she doesn't like body modifications. She told him she finds them trashy and it reminds her of her sister's exes. He got mad, called her controlling, and now she's considering ending the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has been clear from the beginning that she doesn't like body mods. They've been dating for three years, so he should have known her stance. If he's considering getting gauges now, maybe he's not respecting her feelings. But on the other hand, he's doing it for a friend's sobriety celebration, which might be important to him. Is it controlling if she's expressed her dislike before? Or is it about personal choice?\n\nBody modifications are personal decisions. Even if she doesn't like them, does he have the right to make that choice despite her objections? The key here is whether she's trying to control him or just expressing her preferences. If he knew her feelings but still wants to proceed, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. But if he feels his choice is being policed, that's a conflict.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she communicated her feelings clearly. However, he should also have the right to make his own choices unless they directly affect her. But since they're in a relationship, mutual respect is important. Maybe the problem is that she's expressing disapproval, which is her right, but he's reacting negatively to her feelings. The fact that he called her controlling suggests he might be overreacting. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
