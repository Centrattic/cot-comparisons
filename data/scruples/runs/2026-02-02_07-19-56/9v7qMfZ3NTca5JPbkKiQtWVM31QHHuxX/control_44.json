When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to get gauges. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author made it clear three years ago that she doesn't like body modifications, considering them trashy. She's been consistent with her stance. Now, the boyfriend wants to get gauges to support a friend who's sober. The author objects, and he gets mad, calling her controlling. She's now doubting the relationship.\n\nSo, who's at fault? Well, the author communicated her feelings upfront. That's important because boundaries should be discussed early. The boyfriend, on the other hand, knew her stance but still decided to pursue something she dislikes. That could be seen as disregarding her feelings, even if his intentions are good (supporting a friend). \n\nBut body modification is a personal choice. The boyfriend might feel that supporting his friend is important, and if the author is against it, it's a conflict in values. The question is whether the author is being controlling by not allowing him to make a personal choice. However, since she communicated her feelings upfront, it's not necessarily controlling but rather setting boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction of getting mad and accusing her of being controlling might indicate a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's values and boundaries. The boyfriend could have tried to find a compromise, like a different way to support his friend. The author isn't wrong for upholding her values, especially since they were clear. The boyfriend's choice might be valid, but he needs to consider her feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she communicated her stance and is standing by her values, which is a reasonable boundary. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about not respecting those boundaries, not the other way around.\n"
