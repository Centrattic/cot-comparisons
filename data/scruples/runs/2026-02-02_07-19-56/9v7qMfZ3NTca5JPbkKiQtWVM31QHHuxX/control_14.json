When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting her boyfriend to get gauges. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend didn't have any body modifications before, and the girlfriend made her feelings clear from the start that she doesn't like them, finding them trashy. They've been together for three years, so he's been aware of this for a while. Now he wants to get gauges to support a friend who's a body mod enthusiast and is celebrating sobriety. \n\nThe girlfriend objects, and the boyfriend gets angry, calling her controlling. The question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend expressed her preferences early on. It's reasonable for her to not want her partner to get something she dislikes, especially since it might affect her feelings. On the other hand, the boyfriend is making a personal choice to support his friend, and he might feel his autonomy is being restricted. \n\nBut considering that she made her stance clear and he's choosing to go against her wishes despite knowing her feelings, maybe the issue is more about respect for her boundaries. However, the boyfriend's right to make his own decisions is also a factor. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend communicated her dislike from the start. The boyfriend, while wanting to support his friend, needs to consider her feelings. But if he respects her enough, he might choose not to proceed. However, if he feels his autonomy is taken away, that's a problem. \n\nThe line between being controlling and respecting boundaries is thin here. The girlfriend isn't forbidding him; she's expressing her dislike. However, if he proceeds, he might be prioritizing his friend's needs over her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should consider each other's feelings. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her controlling suggests he might not be considering her feelings properly. The girlfriend's concern isn't just about the gauges but about the type of people she associates with, which might hint at deeper insecurities. \n\nBut ultimately, he's an adult and can make his own choices. The question is whether it's wrong for her to ask him not to do it. Since he's aware and choosing to go against her wishes, maybe the fault isn't on her. She's not forcing him, just expressing her feelings. \n\nSo the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong. She communicated her feelings, and while he's choosing to act against them, she's not controlling if she's not stopping him. However, if she's pressuring him not to go through with it beyond communication, that's different. But the scenario suggests she just expressed her dislike and he got angry. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
