When we met, I made it very clear that I don't like them because I think they're trashy. I know some people like them, which is fine, but I personally do not. We've been dating for about three years and nothing much has changed since then until just recently.\n\nThis past week, my bf says he wants to get gauges in his ears as a show of solidarity with his friend who is a big body mod enthusiast. He says his friend recently became sober and he wants to celebrate with him by getting small gauges (the earring things) in his ears. He said it would mean a lot to his friend but I told him I hate it because I think it's trashy and it reminds me of some of the scumbag type people my sister used to date (I know not all people who like mods are trashy but it's just how I feel). He got really mad and told me I was being controlling. I'm not sure if I want to be in this relationship anymore because he knew I don't like them but he wants to do it anyway.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the boyfriend wants to get ear gauges, but the girlfriend doesn't like it because she thinks they're trashy. They've been dating for three years, and she made her stance clear when they met. Now, he wants to do it as a solidarity gesture for his friend, but she's upset and feels he's being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal boundaries and communication. The author mentioned she made it clear from the start that she doesn't like body modifications. So, he knew her feelings. But he still wants to proceed. Is that a problem? Well, in a relationship, both people should respect each other's boundaries. However, body modifications are a personal choice, and the boyfriend might feel his autonomy is being challenged.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend getting angry and calling her controlling could be an overreaction. If he knew her feelings, he should have discussed it more carefully instead of reacting negatively. But she's also making a decision based on her personal preferences, which might be seen as a boundary. The key here is whether her objection is about his autonomy or her comfort.\n\nThe author is conflicted because she doesn't want to be in the relationship anymore if he proceeds despite her feelings. That shows she's prioritizing her own comfort and respecting her boundaries. However, the boyfriend's right to make his own choices is also a factor. \n\nI think the main issue is whether her objection is a deal-breaker. Since they've been together three years, maybe she should have addressed it more directly before now. But she did mention it from the start. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive of her feelings, which isn't healthy. However, she's also not in the wrong for standing by her boundary. Maybe the problem is more about communication and mutual respect than right or wrong. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to compromise. If the boyfriend is willing to go against her wishes despite knowing her feelings, that's a red flag. But the author is also making a choice based on her own preferences. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she communicated her feelings, and he's choosing to proceed despite that. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. Maybe some would argue that body mods are personal and she's being controlling. But others would say he's disregarding her boundaries. I think the consensus leans towards her not being in the wrong because she communicated her stance and he's choosing to ignore it, which is his choice, but she's not wrong for having those feelings.\n"
