We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Muslim person who didn't get their meal without pork (bacon) even after requesting it twice. The manager was dismissive, and the author left without paying for their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. In Islam, consuming pork is haram, so the author has a valid reason to avoid it. The restaurant should accommodate dietary restrictions if they're aware. The first burger had bacon, which they found out and asked for a replacement. The second one still had bacon bits and the same plate, which is a problem because cross-contamination is also an issue. The manager's response was to say it's not a big deal since the person isn't allergic. But the author's point is about religious beliefs and the proper handling of food, not just allergies. \n\nThen, the author left without paying for the brother's meal. The question is whether that's justified. The user might be looking for a judgment on if the author overreacted. The restaurant didn't fulfill the order despite multiple requests, leading to frustration. The author's argument is about consumer rights and respecting their beliefs. The manager's dismissiveness likely escalated the situation. \n\nLeaving without paying could be seen as a protest against the restaurant's failure to meet the request, but it's also a form of not paying for the service, which is a violation of consumer ethics. However, the author might have felt that the restaurant wasn't taking their concerns seriously, so they refused to pay as a stand against the trivialization. \n\nOn one hand, the restaurant has a responsibility to honor special requests and avoid cross-contamination. On the other, the author's refusal to pay might be seen as a harsh response. But in this case, the manager's attitude (\"but you're not allergic\" and laughing) shows a lack of respect for the religious requirements. The author's actions could be justified as standing up for their beliefs, especially if the restaurant isn't properly trained to handle such requests. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong because the restaurant failed to accommodate their religious dietary needs and the manager was dismissive. The refusal to pay might be a strong move, but given the context, it's understandable as a protest. Therefore, answer B.\n"
