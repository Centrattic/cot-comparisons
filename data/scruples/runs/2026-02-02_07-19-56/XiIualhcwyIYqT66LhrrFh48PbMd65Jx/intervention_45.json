We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a conflict at a restaurant. Let me recap the situation.\n\nThe person is Muslim and can't eat pork. They ordered a burger, specified no pork, got a burger with bacon twice. The waiter tried to fix it but didn't do it properly. They spoke to the manager, who dismissed their concerns, saying they're not allergic. The author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's responsibility. They should accommodate dietary restrictions, especially religious ones. The fact that the waiter didn't properly remove the bacon the first time and then didn't make a new burger on a clean plate is a problem. The manager's response seems dismissive, which is unprofessional. However, the user didn't pay for the meal, which is a significant action.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong for refusing to pay. Legally, if you order a meal and don't pay, even if there's an issue, that could be seen as theft or breach of contract. However, the author might argue that the restaurant failed to deliver what was paid for, so they refused to pay as a form of protest. But in many places, refusing to pay a bill because of a mistake isn't a valid reason. The proper step would be to address the issue and seek a refund or ask to leave the meal. Walking out and not paying could be considered unethical or illegal.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's actions were definitely at fault. They didn't respect the customer's dietary needs, which is a serious issue. The manager's dismissive attitude is unprofessional. The author might feel that their religious beliefs were disrespected, and the refusal to pay is a way to hold the restaurant accountable.\n\nHowever, the act of not paying for the meal, even as a protest, could be seen as taking it too far. The author could have left the meal and asked for a refund or left a bad review. Refusing to pay might be seen as taking the law into their own hands, which isn't the right approach. The author's brother did eat the meal, so the non-payment affects both of them. The author might be trying to make a statement, but the consequences of not paying (like legal action or a negative mark) could outweigh the intended message.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not paying the bill, even though the restaurant made a mistake. The correct course of action would have been to address the issue and seek a resolution through proper channels, not by refusing to pay.\n"
