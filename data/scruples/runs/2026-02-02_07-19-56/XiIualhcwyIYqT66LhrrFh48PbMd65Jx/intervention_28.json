We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after this incident. So, the situation is that the author and their brother went to a restaurant, and the author is Muslim, so they can't eat pork. They asked for a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon. The waiter sent it back, and after the second time, there were still bits of bacon. The manager was dismissive, leading the author to leave without paying for the meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They did follow the proper steps: communicated their dietary restrictions, had the waiter note it, and when the issue wasn't resolved, escalated to the manager. The manager's response seems dismissive and not empathetic, especially downplaying the religious significance and the health concerns. The author then left without paying, as a form of protest. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key factors are: did the restaurant fail to meet their reasonable request? The author's dietary restrictions are both religious and could be considered a health issue if there's a risk of cross-contamination. The restaurant's failure to accommodate that request properly could be a breach of service. However, not paying for the meal might be seen as a form of civil disobedience. Legally, not paying could be a problem because the author made a purchase and then refused to pay, which might lead to a dispute. Ethically, the author's stance is about respecting their beliefs and the restaurant's negligence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have chosen to pay and then filed a complaint or left a review. But the manager's attitude might have escalated the situation. The author's response was a strong statement about being respected, but refusing payment is a significant action. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's main issue was the restaurant not fulfilling their order as per their specific request, which they communicated clearly. The manager's dismissive attitude and the restaurant's failure to correct the issue after multiple attempts might justify the author's decision, even if it's not the typical way to handle it. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a legal aspect where they should have paid regardless. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or socially, not legally. So, B (No, not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
