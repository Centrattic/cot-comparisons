We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves them not paying for a meal after having an issue with a restaurant's handling of their request to remove bacon due to religious dietary restrictions.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the author's religious beliefs (as a Muslim, they can't eat pork at all, including anything that's touched pork). They ordered a burger, twice asked to remove bacon, but the restaurant didn't properly remove it both times. The manager dismissed their concerns, comparing it to an allergy but the author pointed out that the issue is religious, not just about allergies. They left without paying for their brother's meal as a statement.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they did communicate their dietary restrictions clearly, the restaurant failed to comply despite being asked twice. The manager's response was dismissive and didn't take the request seriously, which could be seen as disrespectful or negligent. The author's refusal to pay could be viewed as a protest against the restaurant's lack of accommodation for their religious needs. However, not paying for the meal might be legally and ethically questionable because they did receive a meal (for their brother) and the restaurant provided the service. \n\nBut there's an argument here about the restaurant's responsibility to accommodate dietary restrictions, especially when explicitly stated. If the restaurant failed in their duty, the author might feel justified in withholding payment as a form of protest. However, the legal side usually requires payment for services rendered unless there's a breach of terms that nullifies the contract, which might not be the case here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to leave without paying could be seen as taking it too far, as they did consume a meal (their brother's) and the proper recourse might have been to dispute the charge through the payment method or request a refund. Also, the manager's dismissive attitude was unprofessional, but the author's response of not paying could be considered a breach of the social contract of dining out. \n\nSo, the ethical dilemma is whether the author's actions were a justified stand for their beliefs or an overreaction. Given that they had valid religious reasons and the restaurant didn't properly address the issue, some might side with the author. However, the act of not paying for the meal, even if as a protest, is generally frowned upon as it affects the business and the other person (the brother) who might still owe the payment. The manager's response was indeed poor, but the author's choice to withhold payment might still make them the asshole in some eyes. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced, but the key is whether the author's refusal to pay was the right action. Since they had a valid complaint but the method of protest was unconventional and affected others, it's possible they are in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
