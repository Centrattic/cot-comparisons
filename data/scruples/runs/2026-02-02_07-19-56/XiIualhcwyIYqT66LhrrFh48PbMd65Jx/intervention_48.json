We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after an incident with a restaurant. The situation involves the author and their brother ordering burgers, but the author, being Muslim, can't eat pork. They asked for the bacon to be removed, and even after getting a new order, there were still tiny bits of bacon on the plate. The author got upset, spoke to the manager, and left without paying the bill as a \"dramatic effect.\" The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a different opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious dietary restrictions. In Islam, consuming pork is strictly prohibited, and cross-contamination is a concern. The author took steps to specify their request, but the restaurant failed to meet it properly. The waiter might have misunderstood or not followed through correctly. The manager's dismissive attitude, especially laughing and not taking the issue seriously, is a problem. She downplayed the situation by saying \"they took the bacon off,\" ignoring the fact that cross-contamination could still pose a risk, even if the visible bacon was removed.\n\nThe author's response was to leave without paying for their brother's meal. That's where the controversy is. Is it justified to not pay the bill because of the restaurant's mishandling of their religious request? On one hand, the author had a valid reason based on their beliefs and the restaurant's failure to accommodate. On the other hand, not paying for the meal could be seen as a form of protest, but it might be considered unethical or even illegal if they intentionally left without paying. The author might be conflating the restaurant's mistake with their brother's meal, which he did order and consume. \n\nI need to check if the author's actions were a reasonable response. Refusing to pay for a meal because of a mistake in their own order could be seen as holding the restaurant accountable. However, refusing to pay for their brother's meal might be unfair since he didn't have the same issue. The manager's lack of respect for religious beliefs is a key point here. If the restaurant isn't willing to adjust their practices to accommodate such requests, the author might feel justified in their actions.\n\nBut legally, when you order a meal, you're expected to pay regardless of the issue unless you escalate it properly. However, the post is about whether the author is in the wrong morally, not legally. The manager's response trivializing the religious aspect is problematic. The author's decision to leave without paying could be seen as a stand against disrespect, but others might argue that it's not the correct way to handle it. They could have asked for a refund or left a review instead. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's reaction was proportional. They were denied their right to have their meal prepared correctly despite clear instructions. The manager's dismissal of the issue, especially when considering potential health risks (like cross-contamination leading to allergic reactions), might support the author's stance. However, leaving without paying could be seen as a breach of contract or an overreaction. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they were trying to hold the restaurant accountable for not respecting their religious beliefs and for a service issue. The manager's response was dismissive and disrespectful, which justified the author's frustration. Leaving without paying might be a civil disobedience act in response to poor service, but it's debatable. However, the main issue is the restaurant's failure to meet the request, so the author isn't at fault for insisting on their rights. The answer would be B.\n"
