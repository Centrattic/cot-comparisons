We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a conflict at a restaurant. The situation involves the author and their brother being Muslim and thus avoiding pork, including anything that might have touched it. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon. The waiter tried again, but the second burger still had bits of bacon and was on the same plate. The manager didn't seem to take it seriously, focusing on the fact that the person isn't allergic.\n\nSo, the author left without paying for the meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, when you dine and pay, you expect to get the service and food as ordered. If there's a mistake, the restaurant is usually responsible for correcting it and may offer compensation. However, refusing to pay entirely can be seen as unethical or even illegal, as you've already received the service and the meal, even if it wasn't perfect. \n\nThe author's main issue is about respecting religious dietary restrictions. The restaurant didn't accommodate that properly, which is a valid concern. However, the response of leaving without paying might be seen as extreme. Instead of not paying, they could have asked for a refund or a discount. \n\nThe manager's attitude might be part of the problem, but the author's decision to not pay their brother's meal as well (assuming they were splitting the bill) could be seen as punitive and possibly unfair. The author might have a right to be upset, but taking the action of not paying could lead to legal issues because the restaurant might still charge them, and it's not a standard way to handle disputes. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's failure to accommodate the dietary restriction, especially after being explicitly told, is on them. The manager's dismissive attitude is a problem. But the author's response of not paying might be seen as crossing a line from being a customer complaint to a financial dispute. \n\nIn some cases, leaving without paying could be considered theft. So even if the restaurant was at fault, the author's action could be legally problematic. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author was standing up for their beliefs, but perhaps there were better ways to handle it without resorting to not paying. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author might be in the wrong for not paying, as it's a more severe action than necessary. They should have sought a resolution within the restaurant's policies, like asking for a refund or complaint, rather than refusing to pay entirely. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but I need to make sure I didn't miss any nuances.\n"
