We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not paying for a meal after an incident at a restaurant where their religious dietary restrictions were not properly addressed.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person is Muslim and can't eat pork, including anything that's touched it. They ordered a burger without bacon, but it came with bacon twice. They tried to resolve it with the waiter and then the manager. The manager downplayed the issue, saying they took the bacon off, but the author felt this was trivializing their religious beliefs. They left without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide A or B.\n\nThe main factors here are the restaurant's responsibility to accommodate dietary restrictions and the customer's right to get what they ordered. The author made their request clear both times, but the restaurant failed to comply. The manager's response was dismissive, which could be seen as a failure to respect the customer's needs. However, the author then refused to pay for their brother's meal as a form of protest. \n\nThe question is whether the author was justified in not paying. Legally, not paying for a meal is typically wrong, but ethically, if the restaurant violated the customer's terms (specifically their religious and health-related requests), there might be some argument. However, the author could have tried other avenues like reporting the issue to a higher authority, asking for a refund, or leaving a bad review. Refusing to pay could be seen as a form of civil disobedience, but it's still generally considered unethical or against the social contract of dining out. \n\nOn the other hand, the manager's dismissiveness and the restaurant's failure to accommodate a known restriction might make the author's frustration understandable. But the act of leaving without paying is where the ethical line might be crossed. The author could have still paid and taken the issue further, but instead chose to not pay as a protest. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at whether the action was a reasonable response. While the restaurant was at fault, not paying for a meal is usually seen as wrong because it's a financial loss to the restaurant. The author could have addressed the issue without refusing to pay. Hence, the author might be considered \"in the wrong\" for that specific action, even if the restaurant's behavior was unacceptable.\n"
