We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a conflict with a restaurant manager. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person is Muslim and can't eat pork, including things that have touched pork. They ordered a burger, but both times they got bacon. They asked the waiter, who said it was remade without bacon, but there were still bits left. They confronted the manager, who didn't take it seriously, laughed, and dismissed their concerns. The author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a dramatic effect. They're asking if they're the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the customer's rights. The customer has a valid religious restriction that the restaurant didn't accommodate. The restaurant made a mistake twice, and the manager's response was dismissive. The customer was right to point out the health and safety issues, especially since even if they aren't allergic, cross-contamination is a real concern. The manager's laughter and minimizing the issue suggests poor customer service and lack of respect for the customer's beliefs.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to leave without paying for the meal. That's where it gets tricky. While the restaurant was at fault for not providing what was ordered, not paying for the meal is a form of withholding payment, which could be considered unethical or even illegal. The person could have handled it by reporting the incident, leaving a review, or asking to speak to someone else. Leaving without paying might be seen as taking it too far, even if the restaurant was wrong. \n\nBut there's a balance here. The customer's right to request what they ordered and the restaurant's responsibility to fulfill that. The manager's attitude likely escalated the situation. The author's actions, while extreme, could be seen as a justified protest against poor service. However, not paying is a financial loss to the restaurant, so others might argue that's not fair. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on the proportionality of the response. The author had a valid complaint, but refusing to pay for the meal, especially their brother's, might be seen as taking it too far. However, the manager's dismissive attitude complicates it. The line is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to the restaurant's failure. \n\nI think the key points are: the restaurant failed to accommodate a specific request, the manager was dismissive, and the author left without paying. The author's right to expect their dietary restrictions to be respected is important. But withholding payment is a form of retaliation. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but some might say they went too far. However, given the manager's lack of respect and the repeated mistakes, others might support the author's decision. \n\nI lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the restaurant didn't fulfill their order and the manager was disrespectful. But it's close. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
