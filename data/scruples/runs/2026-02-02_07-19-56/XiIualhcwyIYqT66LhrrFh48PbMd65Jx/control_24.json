We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves them not paying for a meal after a negative experience at a restaurant where their religious dietary restrictions weren't properly addressed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person is Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that's touched pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon. The waiter got them another, which still had bacon bits. The manager laughed off their concerns and said to take the bacon off, which the person argued wasn't enough, especially if they had an allergy. The person then left without paying the bill as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nSo, the main issue is whether they were right to not pay. The user wants to know if they're in the wrong (A or B). \n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the restaurant didn't fulfill the request properly. The customer had specific needs due to religious beliefs, which should be respected. The manager's dismissive attitude is unprofessional. However, the customer's response was to leave without paying. That's a point against them. \n\nBut in some places, there's a concept of a \"customer's right to refuse service if their needs aren't met,\" but generally, even if the service is poor, the customer is still expected to pay for any items received. However, in this case, the second burger was remade but still had bacon. If they didn't consume the meal, maybe they could dispute the charge? But the user says they left without paying for their brother's meal as well, which might be part of the issue. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the restaurant didn't respect their beliefs and made them feel trivialized. But leaving without paying is a form of protest, which might be seen as extreme. Legally, the restaurant would still expect payment for the meals ordered, even if there was an error. However, the manager's response was inconsiderate, and the restaurant might have been at fault here. \n\nSo the question is, is the person wrong for not paying? If they didn't receive the service they paid for, maybe they aren't wrong. But typically, you can't just refuse to pay regardless of the situation. However, the restaurant's negligence and the manager's attitude might justify some form of protest. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the person not paying is ethically questionable, even if the restaurant was at fault. The proper course would be to leave, perhaps, but still pay for the service received or contact the restaurant later to settle any issues. \n\nSo the answer is probably A, the person is in the wrong because they didn't pay for the meal even though they didn't receive what they paid for. But maybe the restaurant is also at fault. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, yes, probably A.\n"
