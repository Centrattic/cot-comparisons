We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user wants to know if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for not paying for their meal after a conflict with the restaurant staff.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and their brother went to a restaurant. They're Muslim and can't eat pork, which includes bacon. They asked for the bacon to be removed, but the restaurant didn't do it properly. The waiter sent back the same burger and plate, which the author found unacceptable. The manager laughed it off, saying they just took the bacon off. The author left without paying, even though they didn't have a severe allergy but a religious dietary restriction.\n\nSo, the main points are:\n\n1. The restaurant didn't fulfill the request to remove pork (bacon) properly, possibly violating the author's religious beliefs.\n2. The manager dismissed the issue, downplaying the health and religious concerns.\n3. The author refused to pay, citing their right as a consumer and the restaurant's failure to accommodate their needs.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Legally, in many places, restaurants are required to accommodate religious dietary restrictions as a matter of customer service and sometimes law. However, the author didn't have a medical allergy, which complicates the issue. The manager's response was unprofessional, but the author's decision to leave without paying could be seen as a breach of contract because they received the service (the meal) and thus are expected to pay regardless of the issue. However, if the restaurant didn't honor the specific request they made, the customer might have a right to refuse payment as a form of protest or because the service wasn't as agreed. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel they were wronged and that the restaurant didn't respect their beliefs. The manager's dismissive attitude could justify their frustration. But ethically, refusing to pay could be seen as a strong move, especially if the author's brother did eat the meal. It might be considered unfair to penalize the restaurant (and possibly the staff) for the manager's mistake. \n\nThe question of \"ITA\" (Is the author in the wrong) often hinges on societal norms and expectations. If the restaurant failed to provide the service the customer paid for, the customer isn't necessarily wrong for not paying. However, if the author left without finishing the meal or causing a scene, that might affect the perception. The author's brother might still have eaten, so not paying could be seen as holding the entire restaurant responsible for a mistake that affected only one person. \n\nIn conclusion, the situation is a bit nuanced. The restaurant clearly messed up by not following the request and the manager's response was poor. The author's right to food that adheres to their religious beliefs is valid. However, refusing to pay could be a point of contention. If the author's intention was to make a point about their rights, then it's a personal choice. But in terms of typical consumer ethics, once you receive a service, you're expected to pay for it, even if there was a mistake. The author might be in the right in terms of their beliefs and the restaurant's failure, but not paying is a gray area. However, the manager's dismissiveness and the restaurant's failure to accommodate the request could tip the scale in the author's favor.\n"
