We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying for the meal. The situation involves a Muslim person who can't eat pork, and they got a burger with bacon twice despite requesting no bacon. They got into a conflict with the manager, then left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is whether the author was justified in not paying. The restaurant failed to accommodate a specific dietary restriction, which is both a religious and potential health matter. The first time, the burger had bacon, so they got it remade. The second time, there were still bits left. The manager dismissed their concerns, saying they aren't allergic, and the author left without paying.\n\nSo, from a consumer rights perspective, the restaurant is supposed to provide the service you paid for. If they can't meet your reasonable requests (like no pork for religious reasons), they should handle it properly. The manager's response was dismissive and didn't take the issue seriously, which is on the restaurant. However, the author decided to leave without paying for their brother's meal. That part is contentious. If they left without paying, even as a protest, is that the restaurant's fault? Or is the author responsible for their own meal, not their brother's?\n\nWait, the author says they didn't pay for their brother's meal. So if the brother ordered something that was okay, should the author be responsible for that? Or if the brother's meal was also affected? The story doesn't specify. But the main problem was the author's own burger. The brother's meal isn't mentioned as having any issues, so maybe the author is taking a stand by not paying for both. That could be seen as overstepping. The restaurant provided the brother's meal, which was presumably correct, so not paying for that might be unfair. However, if the author's protest was to make a point about the restaurant's failure to accommodate their dietary needs, maybe they felt it was a collective action. But this is where I need to consider if that's a reasonable action.\n\nAlso, the author left without paying, which is a form of civil disobedience. While the restaurant was at fault, is the customer justified in not paying as a response? Legally, the customer might be in the wrong because the restaurant provided the service, and the customer is responsible for the cost. However, ethically, if the restaurant failed to meet their request, maybe the customer is justified. But the brother's meal complicates it. If the brother's meal was fine, not paying for it could be an overreaction. \n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could be seen as a protest against the restaurant's lack of accommodation. But is it fair to deny payment for a meal that was correctly provided? The brother's meal might have been okay, so the author is punishing the restaurant for their own issue, not the brother's. But the author might have felt that the entire dining experience was compromised, hence not paying for both. However, is that the restaurant's fault for the brother's meal? Probably not, unless the brother's meal was also affected. The story doesn't say that, so the author might be in the wrong for not paying the brother's portion. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the main question is whether the person is being unreasonable. The restaurant made a mistake, but the author's response of leaving without paying, especially for the brother's meal, might be seen as taking it too far. The restaurant should have handled the request better, but the customer's refusal to pay could be considered an overreaction. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because while the restaurant was at fault, the customer's action of not paying the bill is not justified.\n"
