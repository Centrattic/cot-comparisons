We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not paying for their meal after an incident at a restaurant. The situation involves religious dietary restrictions and a perceived failure by the restaurant staff to accommodate those.\n\nFirst, the author is Muslim and cannot eat pork, including anything that touched pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon. The waiter tried to fix it, but the second burger still had bacon bits. The manager didn't take it seriously, leading the author to leave without paying their share. The key issue is whether the author's response was justified.\n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the restaurant failed to meet the customer's specific dietary request. The author clearly communicated their needs, and the staff didn't properly address it. The manager's dismissive attitude (\"but you're not allergic\") shows a lack of understanding or respect for the author's religious beliefs. The author's argument that even without an allergy, their right to receive the correct meal is valid. \n\nLegally, in many places, businesses must accommodate dietary restrictions, especially religious ones. If the restaurant can't fulfill that, they might be at fault. However, walking out without paying could be seen as a financial penalty, which might not be fair if the restaurant's policy is to charge regardless of service issues. But the author's action was a protest against the disregard for their beliefs, not just a refusal to pay for a single meal. \n\nEthically, the restaurant's negligence led to the issue, and the author's response was a stand for their principles. While leaving without paying could be seen as extreme, the manager's nonchalance and the repeated failure to correct the order might justify the action. The author might not be in the wrong because the restaurant didn't uphold their responsibility, and the author's actions were a reaction to that failure.\n"
