We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a Muslim person, went to a restaurant with their brother and asked for a burger without bacon because of their religious dietary restrictions. The first time, the burger had bacon, and even after getting a second one, there were still bacon bits. The manager dismissed their concerns, saying it's not like they're allergic. The author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author made it clear they can't eat pork, which is a religious requirement. The restaurant failed to provide a meal without pork, even after multiple attempts. The manager was dismissive and didn't take their concerns seriously. The author left without paying, which is the core issue here.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Legally, a restaurant is supposed to accommodate dietary restrictions if they are communicated clearly. However, the author didn't mention if they paid for the first meal or if they were charged before leaving. If they didn't pay at all, maybe the restaurant would be more liable. But the author left without paying for their brother's meal, which could be seen as not fulfilling their part of the agreement, regardless of the restaurant's fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's religious beliefs are important. The restaurant didn't respect those, and the manager's response was dismissive. However, leaving without paying could be seen as an overreaction, even if the restaurant made a mistake. The author could have tried to resolve it without leaving the bill unpaid. On the other hand, the restaurant's negligence in handling a known restriction might justify the author's actions.\n\nAnother angle: the author's brother's meal. The author didn't pay for it as a form of protest. If the brother's meal was ordered separately, maybe the author is in the wrong because the brother might not have been part of the issue. The author's decision to not pay for their brother's meal could be seen as punishing the brother for the restaurant's mistake.\n\nIn terms of consumer rights, the author has the right to get what they ordered. If the restaurant failed to do that, the author could be within their rights to refuse payment, but this is a gray area. However, usually, if a customer is dissatisfied, they might ask for a refund or a replacement, not just leave without paying. The \"dramatic effect\" part suggests it was a deliberate choice to make a point, which might be seen as unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions could be seen as overstepping by not paying for their brother's meal, even if the restaurant was at fault. The moral of the story might be to try to resolve such issues through proper channels like asking for a refund or a discount, rather than leaving without paying. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here. But I need to check if there's any aspect I'm missing. For example, if the restaurant charged them for the first burger, the author might have grounds for a refund. However, the post doesn't mention whether they were charged before leaving. If they paid after the second attempt and then left, it's different. But the author says they left without paying, implying they didn't settle the bill at all. That's a key point. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't pay, which is a breach of contract. The restaurant's fault doesn't absolve the customer from paying if the service was provided. The author should have addressed the issue without leaving the bill unpaid.\n"
