We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying for the meal. The situation involves a Muslim person who can't eat pork, and after two failed attempts to get a bacon-free burger, they left without paying their brother's meal as a protest. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's responsibility. The customer specified no bacon, which is a religious requirement. The first time they sent a burger with bacon, and even after being corrected, the second burger still had bacon. The manager didn't take the issue seriously and laughed it off, saying they just took the bacon off. The author then left without paying for the meal.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the customer's religious dietary restrictions, the restaurant's failure to comply despite being informed, and the manager's dismissive attitude. From a consumer rights perspective, if a business can't fulfill an order that's within their capability (like preparing a bacon-free burger), they might be at fault. The manager's response that \"you're not allergic\" seems to downplay the religious aspect, which is a valid concern. The customer's right to expect their order to be followed, especially when it's a health or religious necessity, is important. \n\nHowever, the author's response was to leave without paying for the meal. Is that justified? In many places, refusing to pay for a meal as a form of protest could be seen as unethical or even illegal, as it's a breach of contract. The customer paid for the meal initially, but the restaurant failed to deliver the correct order. But not paying the bill might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's failure to address the issue properly and the manager's dismissiveness could be seen as neglecting their responsibility. The customer is in a position where they can't consume the food due to religious reasons, and the restaurant isn't accommodating that. In such cases, the customer might have a right to a refund or cancellation, but refusing to pay entirely might be an overreaction. \n\nBut the user's side is that the author is in the wrong. The argument here is that even if the restaurant was at fault, the customer still has to pay for the service they received. However, the customer's main issue is that the food was not as ordered, and they had to leave. If the restaurant was unwilling to resolve it, maybe the correct action is to leave without paying, but that's a gray area. \n\nSo, if I have to choose between A and B, considering that the restaurant was at fault for not fulfilling the order properly and the manager's response was dismissive, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the act of not paying is seen as wrong regardless, then A. But I think the key is whether the customer's actions were a proportional response. Since the restaurant wasn't respecting their religious needs and the manager was unhelpful, leaving without paying might be justified as a protest. So the answer would be B.\n"
