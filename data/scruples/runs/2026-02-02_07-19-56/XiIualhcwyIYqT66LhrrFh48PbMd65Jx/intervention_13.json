We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong for not paying for a meal. The situation is about a Muslim person who can't eat pork, so they ordered a burger without bacon. The first time, they got bacon in it, so they got a new one, but there were still bits of bacon. Then the manager didn't take it seriously, so the author left without paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The restaurant failed to provide what was ordered, specifically removing bacon and ensuring no cross-contamination. The customer had a valid religious reason, not just a preference. The manager's response downplayed the issue, which could be problematic. The author then refused to pay as a form of protest.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, refusing to pay is a form of protest, but generally, when you receive a service, even if it's not perfect, you pay and then file a complaint. Not paying could be seen as unethical or illegal if they didn't receive the meal. On the other hand, the restaurant didn't fulfill the order properly, and the manager was dismissive. However, the author could have asked for a refund or left after refusing the meal but still paying. By not paying, they're using a financial weapon which might be seen as excessive.\n\nBut also, the restaurant has a responsibility to provide what's ordered. If they failed in food safety or religious accommodation, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the act of not paying could affect others, like the brother who paid if it was a shared bill. Also, the manager's response was unprofessional, but the author's choice to leave without paying might escalate the situation unnecessarily.\n\nLegally, in most places, not paying for a meal is theft, regardless of the issue. So even if the restaurant was at fault, the customer would still need to pay and then dispute the charge through proper channels. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't pay, even if the restaurant messed up. Alternatively, if they were denied service due to their religious needs, but that's not the case here. They were given the wrong meal, but they should have left after refusing the second one.\n\nHmm. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't pay for the meal, which is a service they received. Even if the restaurant was negligent, the customer still has to pay and can seek compensation through proper means. Refusing to pay is a breach of contract and could lead to legal issues. So the author is in the wrong for not paying, even though the restaurant's actions were unacceptable.\n"
