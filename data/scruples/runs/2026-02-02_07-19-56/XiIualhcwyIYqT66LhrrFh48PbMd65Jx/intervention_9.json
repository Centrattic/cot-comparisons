We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a Muslim person who went to a restaurant with their brother and ordered a burger without pork (bacon). The first burger had bacon, the second one still had bits, and when talking to the manager, the manager dismissed their concerns. The author left without paying for their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious dietary restrictions. The user is Muslim, and according to Islamic law, pork is haram, so consuming it is against their faith. The restaurant's failure to accommodate that could be seen as a serious issue. The user tried to get a correct order but the restaurant kept providing contaminated food. The manager's response was dismissive, which probably escalated the situation.\n\nNow, the key points here: the user didn't pay for the meal. Typically, not paying for a service is considered wrong, but there's context here. The user's religious beliefs were violated, and the restaurant didn't take it seriously. The user left because they felt their beliefs were trivialized. However, walking out without paying is a form of non-payment, which is against standard consumer practices. But maybe there's a balance between the restaurant's responsibility and the customer's right to their religious observance.\n\nThe manager's response was unhelpful. The user's actions might be justified because the restaurant failed to provide what was ordered, and the manager didn't take the issue seriously. However, the author is in a position where they have to pay for the meal regardless unless they can prove the restaurant's negligence led to a problem. But since they didn't have an allergic reaction, maybe the manager is right in saying they're not allergic. However, the religious aspect is a separate concern. The restaurant should accommodate dietary restrictions regardless of allergies.\n\nIn some cases, refusing to pay for a service when the service wasn't rendered properly could be justified, but that's usually in legal or contractual contexts. Here, the user is a customer who didn't get the correct food. The restaurant's fault is clear. However, leaving without paying is a bold move and might be seen as taking a stand, but it's against the norm. The user could have tried to resolve it another way, like reporting the incident and then paying but leaving a bad review, but since they were upset, maybe they felt that was the only way to make a point.\n\nThe question is whether not paying is in the wrong. On one hand, the restaurant didn't fulfill the order as requested, so the user is within their rights to refuse payment if they can prove the restaurant's fault. But in practice, most people would still pay and then complain, maybe ask for a refund. The user's choice to not pay for their brother's meal as a dramatic effect might be seen as a bit extreme, but considering the repeated failures and the manager's dismissiveness, it might be understandable.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. Legally, if the restaurant didn't provide the service as agreed, the user might have a case. But socially, refusing to pay is often frowned upon unless there's a clear breach of contract. However, the user's religious beliefs are being violated, which is a significant matter. The manager's lack of understanding or respect could be a factor. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers both the legal aspect and social norms. The user's actions might be seen as justified because the restaurant didn't accommodate their needs, and the manager was dismissive. However, walking out without paying is a strong move. The answer would hinge on whether the restaurant's failure to provide the correct meal as ordered is a sufficient reason to not pay. If the restaurant is at fault, the user isn't in the wrong. But if the user is expected to pay regardless, then they are. Given the situation, I think the user isn't in the wrong (B) because the restaurant didn't fulfill the order properly and the manager was dismissive, making the user's actions a reasonable response under the circumstances.\n"
