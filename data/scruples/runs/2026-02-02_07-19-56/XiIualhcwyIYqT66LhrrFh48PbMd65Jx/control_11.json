We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying for the meal. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe person and their brother went to a restaurant. They're Muslim, so they can't eat pork. They usually check if items have pork and ask to have it removed. This time, the first burger had bacon, which is pork. They asked the waiter for a new one, and the waiter said it was a new burger. But when they got it, there were still tiny bits of bacon and pieces on the plate. The person got angry, talked to the manager, explained their religious reasons and health concerns, but the manager didn't take it seriously, laughed, and said \"but you're not allergic.\" The person left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the restaurant's responsibility. Since the customer clearly stated dietary restrictions, which are important for both religious and health reasons, the restaurant should have accommodated that. The fact that they didn't remove the bacon properly and sent back food that was already touched might be a violation of the restaurant's duty to fulfill the order as requested. Even more so, if there were allergies involved, not taking proper precautions could be dangerous. The manager's dismissive attitude is problematic because the customer's request was valid, and the manager trivialized their concerns by comparing it to allergies.\n\nNow, the person left without paying for their brother's meal. Is that justified? Well, they were non-compliant with the service provided, which is the meal. However, the restaurant also failed to meet their request, so there's a mutual issue here. The person didn't pay because they felt disrespected and the restaurant didn't take their needs seriously. But in most places, not paying for a service or product you received is considered unethical or even illegal. Even if the service was inadequate, the customer still received the meal (even if it was wrong), and not paying could be seen as a form of protest, but it's not typically accepted as a valid reason to not pay.\n\nHowever, the restaurant's failure to fulfill the specific request was a problem. If the restaurant was aware of the dietary restrictions and still failed to accommodate, maybe the customer isn't entirely to blame. But the customer's action of not paying is a separate issue. They could have asked for a refund or compensation, but refusing to pay entirely could be seen as wrong because they did receive the service (though faulty) and the brother's meal was also paid for, which might not be their fault.\n\nThe person's argument is that the restaurant didn't respect their religious beliefs and health concerns. The manager's response was dismissive, which is problematic. But the act of leaving without paying is a breach of consumer ethics. Even if the restaurant was at fault, the customer's response could be seen as taking it too far. They could have left a complaint, given a negative review, or used other methods to address the issue without refusing to pay for the meal.\n\nSo, the restaurant is definitely at fault for not providing the correct meal, but the customer's refusal to pay is where the question lies. In most contexts, you don't pay for a service if it's not delivered correctly, but the customer still received the meal and the brother's portion. However, the brother might not be at fault, so maybe the customer is only responsible for their own meal. The customer's choice to not pay as a form of protest could be seen as justified in some ways, but ethically, it's usually expected to pay for what you received and then seek a refund or compensation through proper channels.\n\nIn conclusion, the customer's action of not paying might be seen as wrong because they received a product and service, even if it was flawed. Not paying is a breach of the consumer contract. However, the restaurant's failure to accommodate dietary restrictions is definitely on their end. The customer could have taken other steps, like leaving a complaint, but refusing to pay is a strong action that might be considered wrong.\n"
