We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not paying for the meal. The situation involves them going to a restaurant, asking for a burger without bacon because of their religious beliefs (as a Muslim, they can't eat pork or anything that touched it). The first burger had bacon, so they asked for a new one. The second one still had bits of bacon, and the manager dismissed their concerns, saying they're not allergic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's religious beliefs are important here. They can't eat pork at all, even if it's just touched. So the restaurant's failure to prepare a completely separate burger without any bacon is a problem. The manager's response seems dismissive, not taking their religious restrictions seriously, even after the second mistake. The author left without paying for their brother's meal as a form of protest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the restaurant made a mistake, and the manager didn't handle it well. The author's right to their dietary restrictions is valid. On the other hand, refusing to pay for the meal, including their brother's, might be seen as a harsh action. However, the author mentions it was a \"dramatic effect\" to show they won't accept the treatment. \n\nBut wait, even if the restaurant made a mistake, the author could have requested a refund or talked it out. However, the manager's refusal to acknowledge the severity of the issue might justify the author's frustration. Also, the fact that the restaurant didn't properly accommodate their request twice could be a sign of negligence, especially when food safety and religious respect are involved. \n\nIn terms of consumer rights, the author paid for a service that wasn't delivered correctly. They had the right to demand a proper replacement or a refund. The manager's laughter and trivializing the situation might have escalated the problem. The author's decision to leave without paying could be seen as a stand for their beliefs, but it might also be considered a violation of the agreement (paying for the meal). However, if the restaurant failed to provide what was ordered and didn't take the complaint seriously, the author might have a valid reason to walk out. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to the restaurant's failure and the manager's dismissiveness. The author's main issue was the religious violation and the lack of proper accommodation. Since the manager wasn't taking it seriously, the author's refusal to pay might be justified as a form of protest. However, in many places, refusing to pay for a meal you didn't get is still a civil issue. But given the context, the restaurant's fault and the manager's response, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
