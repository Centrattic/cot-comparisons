We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a conflict at a restaurant. The situation involves the author's religious dietary restrictions as a Muslim, specifically regarding pork and cross-contamination. The key points are:\n\n1. The author and brother ordered a burger without bacon but received one with it.\n2. The waiter was informed, a new burger was ordered, but it still had bacon traces and was on the same plate.\n3. The manager dismissed the issue, focusing on the fact that the author isn't allergic and offered a new burger.\n4. The author left without paying for the meal and his brother's as a protest.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants an opinion. I need to decide if the author's actions were justified or if they overstepped.\n\nFirst, the religious dietary laws are important. As a Muslim, avoiding pork and cross-contamination is a matter of faith and health. The restaurant's failure to accommodate this could be seen as a breach of service. The manager's dismissive attitude, especially after the author explained the religious aspect and potential health risks, might have escalated the situation.\n\nHowever, leaving without paying could be seen as a financial protest. Legally, not paying for a meal you received is typically considered theft or a breach of contract. While the author might have felt wronged, withholding payment isn't a legal solution. The restaurant has the right to charge for the service provided, regardless of the dispute.\n\nThe author's main argument is consumer rights\u2014getting what you paid for. But when you don't pay, you're not just making a statement; you're committing an offense. The manager's response was unhelpful, but the author's refusal to pay could backfire legally. The author might have a valid complaint about the service but should address it through appropriate channels, like leaving a review, contacting the restaurant's management in writing, or involving a consumer protection agency.\n\nSo, while the restaurant's failure to meet dietary restrictions is a problem, the author's refusal to pay is where the issue turns legally problematic. The author is in the wrong because they didn't pay for the meal, which is against the terms of service and could result in penalties. The correct approach would be to seek a resolution within legal and ethical boundaries.\n"
