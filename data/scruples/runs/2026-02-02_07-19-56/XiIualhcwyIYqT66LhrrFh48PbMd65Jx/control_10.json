We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant with their brother, and the restaurant served a burger with bacon despite them specifying no pork. They had to get it remade, but the second time it still had bacon bits. The manager was dismissive, so the person left without paying for the meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's perspective. They have a religious dietary restriction that's important to them. The restaurant didn't honor their request properly, and the manager didn't take it seriously. The person was frustrated and left to protest the treatment of their beliefs. \n\nNow, the question is whether they're in the wrong. From a consumer rights standpoint, customers should get what they ordered. If the restaurant failed to provide that, the customer has a right to complain. However, refusing to pay entirely might be an issue. In many places, refusing to pay for a meal is considered theft or at least unethical, regardless of the reason. Even if there was a problem, the appropriate action would be to dispute the charge through proper channels, not to walk out without paying. \n\nBut the person's religious beliefs do play a role here. They have a right to request food that aligns with their religion. The restaurant's failure to accommodate that could be a significant issue. However, the act of not paying might be seen as a form of protest, but it's not the standard or legal way to handle such a dispute. \n\nSo, the person might have been justified in their frustration and in pointing out the restaurant's failure to meet their dietary needs. However, leaving without paying could be seen as wrong because it's against the social contract of paying for services received. Unless they had a prior agreement or it's a form of civil disobedience, which is rare in such contexts. \n\nThe manager's dismissiveness is definitely a problem, but the consumer's response of not paying might cross a line. The person could have asked to speak to a manager again, requested a refund, or left a bad review. Refusing to pay could lead to legal issues, so it's probably not the right course of action. \n\nTherefore, while the restaurant was at fault for not handling the request properly, the person's decision to not pay might be considered wrong because it's an illegal act, even if motivated by a legitimate grievance.\n"
