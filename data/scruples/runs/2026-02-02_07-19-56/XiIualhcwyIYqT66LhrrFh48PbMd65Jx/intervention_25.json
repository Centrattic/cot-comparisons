We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not paying for their meal after a restaurant mishap. The situation is that the author and their brother, who are Muslim, went to a restaurant and ordered a burger without bacon. The first burger had bacon, so they asked for a new one. The second burger still had bacon bits and was on the same plate. The manager dismissed their concerns, and the author left without paying as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both sides. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider the facts. The restaurant didn't fulfill the order correctly despite being asked twice. The author has a religious requirement to avoid pork and things that have touched pork, which is a valid concern. The manager's response was dismissive, which might have added to the frustration. \n\nHowever, the author left without paying for their brother's meal. That's a key point. Even if the restaurant was at fault, not paying a bill is a form of protest, but it's also a breach of contract. The restaurant provided a service (the meals), so the customer has an obligation to pay unless there was a complete failure of service. But in this case, the brother's meal wasn't mentioned as being problematic. So the author is refusing to pay for both meals, which might be an overreach. \n\nAlso, the author's actions could be seen as dishonest because they didn't pay for a service they received. Even if the restaurant was in the wrong, the appropriate action would be to dispute the charge through proper channels, not to leave without paying. That could lead to legal consequences, like being charged for the meal or having it added to a credit card. \n\nThe manager's attitude was poor, but that doesn't justify the author's decision to not pay. The religious aspect adds weight to the dietary restrictions, but the solution of refusing to pay is more harmful. The author could have requested a refund or compensation, but walking out without paying is a different issue. \n\nSo, while the restaurant was clearly at fault for not accommodating dietary restrictions and the manager was dismissive, the author's choice to not pay the bill makes them responsible for the wrong action here. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
