We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not paying for their meal. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is Muslim and can't eat pork. They ordered a burger without bacon. The first burger had bacon, and when they got a replacement, it still had tiny bits. They confronted the waiter and then the manager, who didn't seem to take it seriously. The person left without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nSo, the main points are about religious dietary restrictions, proper service, and the response from the restaurant. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nFrom the customer's perspective, they have a valid religious requirement that's important. The restaurant is supposed to accommodate such requests. But if they can't provide a meal that meets those requirements, then the customer has a right to be upset. The manager's dismissive attitude is a problem here. Saying \"you're not allergic\" doesn't address the religious aspect at all. Restaurants should know that even non-allergic dietary restrictions (like religious ones) need to be respected. The fact that the replacement meal still had bacon bits is a failure on the restaurant's part.\n\nHowever, leaving without paying might be seen as a problem. Even if the restaurant was at fault, not paying could be considered unethical or illegal. The customer could have asked for a refund or compensation instead. By refusing to pay, they're punishing the restaurant, but it's the manager's responsibility to handle such issues. The customer might have overreacted by not paying, even if their complaint was valid.\n\nSo, the author's right to refuse payment might depend on local laws. In some places, you can refuse to pay if the service wasn't as agreed. But in many cases, you can't just leave without paying, even if there's a problem. The manager's response was poor, but the customer's solution (not paying) might cross a line. Hence, the author could be in the wrong for not paying, despite a valid complaint.\n"
