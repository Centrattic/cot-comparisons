We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying a meal after a restaurant mishandled their request to remove bacon. The author is Muslim and can't eat pork, even if it's been touched. They ordered a burger without bacon, got one with bacon twice, and then left without paying their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's responsibility. The author clearly communicated the need for a no-pork meal. The first time, the burger had bacon, which is a clear mistake. The waiter was told again and sent the burger back, but the second time it still had bacon bits and the same plate. The manager laughed off the issue, which might indicate a lack of proper response. \n\nThe author's main points are about health concerns (allergies as an example) and religious beliefs. The manager's response was dismissive, treating the issue as trivial. The author left without paying their brother's meal as a dramatic effect. The question is whether this is justified or not.\n\nI should think about consumer rights. In many places, if a restaurant can't fulfill a dietary requirement due to cross-contamination, the customer can refuse the meal. The author's refusal isn't just about the bacon but the repeated failure to address the issue properly. The manager's attitude of not taking it seriously adds to the justification. \n\nHowever, leaving without paying the brother's meal could be seen as taking a stand, but maybe also as a punitive action. The brother might have ordered something without pork, so the author is penalizing the restaurant by not paying for that as well. Is that fair? The author might argue that the restaurant's systemic issue affects the entire dining experience, so they refuse to pay anything. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's food might not be the problem. If the brother's meal wasn't involved in the cross-contamination, the author's refusal to pay for it could be seen as going beyond the actual issue. The restaurant might have provided the brother's meal correctly, so the author's action could be considered unfair. \n\nBut the key here is that the author's religious beliefs are being disrespected. The manager didn't take the request seriously, which made the author feel their beliefs were trivialized. In some cases, when a restaurant fails to accommodate religious dietary needs, customers have the right to seek compensation or refuse to pay. However, the brother's meal might be a separate issue. \n\nI need to check if the author is legally obligated to pay for the brother's meal even if their own wasn't handled properly. If they were splitting the bill, the brother might be responsible for his own part. The author's decision to not pay at all could be seen as taking a stand, but possibly overreaching. \n\nAlso, the manager's response about not being allergic is dismissive. The author is right to point out that religious dietary restrictions are as important as allergies, even if they don't trigger a physical reaction. The restaurant should respect that. \n\nSo, the author's refusal to pay their own meal is justified, but the brother's meal? If the brother's order was correct, the author might be in the wrong by not paying for it. But if they were paying together, perhaps the author is within their right to not pay anything. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn the end, the author's main action was about their own meal not being handled properly. Not paying for the brother's meal might be a mistake, but the core issue is the restaurant's failure to meet the author's religious needs. The manager's attitude made the situation worse. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not paying their own meal, but the brother's meal? The situation is complex. The answer might depend on local laws and the specifics of the order. But generally, if the restaurant can't accommodate the request, the customer can refuse the impaired meal. However, the brother's meal is a separate order unless the author is responsible for paying it. If the author paid for both, not paying the brother's part is taking a stand, but if the brother paid for his own, the author's action is only about their own meal. The scenario doesn't clarify who paid what, but the author's action was to leave without paying the entire meal, which might include the brother's. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's right to refuse payment for their own meal is justified. The brother's part is a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the right regarding their own meal, but penalizing the brother's meal could be seen as going too far. However, the scenario says the author left without paying for the brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect,\" implying it was a joint order. If the author is responsible for the entire bill, not paying anything could be considered wrong because the brother's meal wasn't the issue. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n\nThe author's main issue is with their meal, but they didn't pay for the brother's. If they were splitting the bill, the author is only responsible for their own part. But if the author paid for both, refusing to pay the brother's part might be seen as taking it out on the brother. The scenario states \"my brothers meal,\" which could mean the author paid for both. The waiter was told in front of the author, so the restaurant was aware of the specific request. The manager's response was dismissive, which is a problem. The author's action might be justified in refusing their own meal's charge, but not the brother's unless there's a connection. So the answer could be A for part of it and B for others. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. \n\nIn many consumer rights contexts, customers can refuse to pay for the item that was incorrect. But refusing the entire bill might be an overreaction. The author's refusal to pay for the brother's meal could be considered wrong if it was a separate, correctly served item. Therefore, the answer might be A because the author is not responsible for the brother's meal if it was correct. However, the scenario says the author left without paying for the brother's meal, which was a correct order. That seems like the author is in the wrong for that part. But the main issue is their own meal. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have a right to leave without paying if the entire dining experience was compromised due to the restaurant's failure to address the issue, even if the brother's meal was okay. The manager's disrespectful attitude could justify the author's decision. But is it common to walk out without paying anything? That's typically seen as wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that the author had the right to refuse their own meal, but the brother's meal was a separate matter. If the brother's meal was fine, the author shouldn't have to pay for it. However, the act of leaving without paying at all could be seen as a form of protest, which is a bit of a gray area. But in most cases, restaurants charge for what they served, and if your meal is incorrect, you can refuse it. The brother's meal might be a different story. If the author paid for both, then not paying the brother's part is an overreaction. If the author and brother were splitting the bill, then the author is in the right. The scenario doesn't specify, but the way the question is phrased, the author is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying the meal (which could imply the whole bill). \n\nIn the end, the author's main issue is valid, but the action of not paying the brother's meal might be excessive. So the answer could be A, but I'm not 100% sure. However, the manager's dismissive attitude is a clear problem, and the restaurant's failure to accommodate correctly might support the author's position. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the restaurant didn't honor the request properly and the manager was disrespectful. The refusal to pay is a response to the service issue and the manager's attitude, even if it's a protest. So the answer is B.\n"
