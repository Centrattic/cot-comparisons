We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Muslim person who can't eat pork or anything that's touched pork. They went to a restaurant, ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon even after they asked to remove it. The waiter tried again, but the second burger still had bits of bacon, and the plate even had bacon pieces. The manager didn't take it seriously, laughed it off, and the author left without paying for their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. For Muslims, consuming pork is strictly prohibited, and cross-contamination is also a big issue. So the restaurant should accommodate that. The first part where they didn't remove the bacon properly is on the restaurant's side. They have a responsibility to honor dietary restrictions, especially when specified.\n\nThen, the author's reaction: after two attempts and the manager being dismissive, they left and didn't pay for the brother's meal. The question is, was that justified? On one hand, the restaurant failed to meet a specific request that's important for the customer's beliefs. On the other hand, refusing to pay for the meal might be considered a form of protest, but does that make the author in the wrong?\n\nIn terms of consumer rights, the customer did communicate their needs, and the restaurant didn't fulfill them despite multiple attempts. The manager's response trivializing the issue by saying \"you're not allergic\" seems to show a lack of understanding. The author's point about not wanting to eat in a place that doesn't respect their beliefs is valid. However, not paying for the brother's meal could be seen as a punishment. If the brother didn't have any issue with the meal, maybe the author is holding the restaurant's mistake against both of them. But the brother might have agreed with the protest.\n\nAnother angle: Is withholding payment a violation of any rules? Restaurants can't charge for a meal if the service was unsatisfactory, but the author went further by not paying for their brother's meal which was presumably fine. So maybe that's where the issue is. However, if the brother's meal is tied to the same order (like a split bill), then not paying at all might be a way to express dissatisfaction. But typically, each person is responsible for their own order unless it's a shared bill. The scenario isn't clear on that. If they split the bill, the author might be responsible for their own part. If they paid as a group, leaving without paying could be seen as unethical, even if the restaurant was at fault.\n\nAlso, the author's tone says they left for a \"dramatic effect\"\u2014which might imply that the action was intentional to make a statement. Depending on the culture, this could be seen as justified or as overreacting. The manager's dismissiveness likely contributed to the decision. However, not paying for a meal when the service was poor is a contentious point. In some cases, it's considered fair to refuse payment if the service was inadequate, but it's often advised to address it through other means first, like a complaint or contacting a higher authority.\n\nSo, the main points: The restaurant failed to accommodate dietary restrictions, which is their fault. The author's refusal to pay their own meal might be understandable, but taking the brother's into account complicates things. If the author left without paying because the restaurant didn't respect their beliefs, that's on the restaurant. But if they left the brother's meal unpaid as well, that might be an overextension. The answer likely hinges on whether the author is taking an ethical stance against a restaurant that ignored their needs, or if they're penalizing the brother for the restaurant's mistake. The story mentions the author left without paying for the brother's meal, which could be seen as a collective protest, but if the brother's meal was fine, that might be where the author is in the wrong. However, in some cases, people might argue that the restaurant's failure to accommodate a religious restriction is a serious enough issue to warrant such a response. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person overstepped their own boundaries. Here, the author's action was a direct response to the restaurant's failure, but the unpaid brother's part might be the point of contention. If the brother didn't mind and agreed, it's different. But if the author made a unilateral decision to withhold payment for both, that's where the problem could be. The story says \"my brothers meal,\" so maybe they were sharing a bill or the author felt responsible for both. However, restaurants usually charge per person, unless it's a shared order. Without more info, it's a bit ambiguous. But in AITA, the focus is often on the individual's actions. The author's own meal was not paid, and that's their responsibility. The brother's part could be a separate issue. If the author left without paying for their own meal, that's one thing, but if they also left the brother's, that might be considered wrong because the brother's meal was presumably okay. So the author is in the wrong for not paying for the brother's meal, even if their own refusal is justified. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they took it too far by not paying for the brother's meal. But if the brother's meal was part of the same order, then maybe not. The scenario is a bit unclear. However, in most cases, each person is responsible for their own order. So the author's refusal to pay their own meal is their choice, but the brother's is separate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not paying for the brother's meal.\n"
