We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a restaurant messed up their order. The author is Muslim and can't eat pork, including anything that's touched pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon and the second one also had bits of it. The waiter said they took the bacon off, but the author was concerned about cross-contamination and the manager's dismissive attitude. The author left without paying their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious dietary restrictions. In Islam, consuming pork is haram (forbidden), and even if it's been in contact with pork, it's still not allowed. So the restaurant's failure to comply with that request was a problem. The author tried to communicate their needs clearly, got a second burger, but it still had bacon. The manager's response was to brush it off, saying they took the bacon off. The author felt their beliefs were trivialized.\n\nNow, the main question is whether not paying the bill is justified. Restaurants typically handle such issues by either fixing the order, providing a discount, or allowing a complaint. However, not paying could be seen as a form of protest, but it's also a financial consequence. The author left the brother's meal unpaid as a \"dramatic effect,\" which might be considered a strong reaction. \n\nI think the key points are the restaurant's failure to accommodate a legitimate request and the manager's dismissive attitude. The author's right to refuse to pay if their dietary laws were violated, but leaving the brother's meal unpaid as a protest might be seen as taking it too far. However, if the restaurant didn't properly address the issue twice, the author might feel it's a pattern of negligence. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the refusal to pay is a reasonable response to the restaurant's repeated failure and the manager's lack of respect. The author might be in the right in terms of their religious needs not being met, but the act of not paying the bill, especially their brother's, could be seen as a harsh action. It's a bit of a gray area. The manager's response was inconsiderate, but the author's financial penalty isn't a typical solution. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their beliefs, but the method of not paying might be the issue.\n"
