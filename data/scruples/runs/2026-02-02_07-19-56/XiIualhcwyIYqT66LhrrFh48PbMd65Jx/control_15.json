We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after the incident at the restaurant.\n\nFirst, the context: The person is Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that's touched pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant messed up twice. The first time, they didn't remove the bacon properly, so they got a new one. The second time, it still had bacon bits on the plate. The manager didn't take the issue seriously, laughed, and dismissed their concerns about health and religious beliefs. The author then left without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nSo, the main points here are: religious dietary restrictions, the restaurant's failure to accommodate, and the manager's dismissive attitude. The author's action was to leave without paying, which is the crux of the AITA question.\n\nLegally and ethically, if a customer makes a valid request and the restaurant can't fulfill it, the customer isn't obligated to pay. The restaurant has a responsibility to accommodate dietary restrictions, especially when clearly communicated. The manager's response was unprofessional and didn't address the core issue. The author's refusal to pay could be seen as standing up for their rights as a consumer and respecting their religious beliefs. However, not paying for a meal that wasn't consumed is a gray area. Some might say it's a justified protest, others might see it as a breach of consumer responsibility. But given that the restaurant failed in their service and the manager was dismissive, the author's action might be considered reasonable. So the answer would likely be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
