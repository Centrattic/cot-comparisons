We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for not paying for a meal. The scenario involves a Muslim brother and sister who went to a restaurant and ordered a burger without bacon. The first burger had bacon, and when they got a replacement, there were still tiny bits and bacon on the plate. The author then confronted the waiter and the manager, explaining their religious beliefs and the potential health issues if they had an allergy. The manager seemed dismissive, laughing and saying they took the bacon off. The author left without paying their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The main issue is the restaurant's failure to accommodate the religious dietary restrictions. The author's frustration is valid because for Muslims, even contact with pork is prohibited, not just eating it. So the presence of bacon bits or a contaminated plate is a problem. The waiter didn't follow through properly, and the manager dismissed the issue, which is a problem from the restaurant's side.\n\nThe author left without paying for the meal. The question is if that makes them at fault. Legally, the restaurant is supposed to honor the customer's request, especially when it comes to allergies or religious practices. If they failed to do so, the customer might have the right to refuse payment until the issue is resolved. However, leaving without paying could be seen as a breach of contract or service agreement. The ethical angle here is about whether the customer's refusal to pay is justified given the restaurant's negligence.\n\nThe manager's response was dismissive, saying \"but you're not allergic.\" That's a key point. The author is right to point out that even without an allergy, the religious prohibition is absolute. The manager's failure to recognize this is a sign of poor customer service and lack of understanding. In such cases, customers often leave without paying to express dissatisfaction, but it's a contentious action because it affects the business and possibly other customers (the brother in this case).\n\nHowever, the author's action might be seen as a protest against the restaurant's inadequate response. If the restaurant didn't properly address the mistake despite being informed, then the customer's right to seek a resolution is important. But in most places, refusing to pay can lead to legal consequences, even if the restaurant was at fault. So while the author's reasoning is understandable, the legal perspective might still hold them responsible for the payment.\n\nOn the ethical side, the manager's nonchalance is definitely wrong. The restaurant should have better procedures to handle such requests. The author's decision to leave without paying could be seen as a justified stand, but it's a risky one. It's more advisable to seek a refund or speak to a manager for compensation, but in this case, the author might not have been given a proper resolution, leading them to leave.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are a response to the restaurant's failure, but refusing to pay could be considered wrong because it's a form of non-payment for the service. However, the restaurant's negligence in handling a religious and potentially health-related issue is the main problem here. The answer depends on balancing the right to refuse services due to non-compliance and the consequences of that action.\n"
