We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying for a meal. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, ordered a burger without bacon because they're Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that's touched it. The first burger had bacon, so they asked for a new one. The waiter said it was remade, but the second one still had bacon bits and the same plate. The person got upset, explained their religious beliefs and the health risks, but the manager didn't take it seriously and even laughed. The person then left without paying for their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. I need to consider both sides. The person is part of a religious group that has specific dietary restrictions. They made their request clear, and the restaurant failed to accommodate it despite multiple attempts. The manager's response was dismissive, which might have contributed to the person's decision to leave. But did they have the right to not pay? \n\nIn many places, the restaurant is responsible for fulfilling the order correctly. If they didn't, the customer might be justified in refusing to pay for the part that was incorrect. However, the person didn't just refuse their own meal but also their brother's. That could be a point of contention. If the brother's meal wasn't affected, maybe the person is wrong to not pay for that. \n\nAlso, the dramatic effect part. Walked out as a statement, which can be seen as using the brother as a pawn. The right to withhold payment for their own meal due to the error is understandable, but not paying for the brother's might be a stretch. The manager's attitude was poor, but the customer's response of not paying the entire bill could be considered extreme. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's negligence in understanding and respecting their religious requirements is a problem. The manager minimizing the issue by saying \"you're not allergic\" is dismissive and potentially disrespectful. The person's main point is about respecting their beliefs and the potential health risks. If the restaurant failed to meet their request even after being told twice, they might have a valid complaint. \n\nBut the key is whether they were right to not pay. Legally, in some jurisdictions, if a restaurant provides a faulty service, the customer can dispute the charge. However, refusing to pay for another person's meal (the brother's) could be seen as wrong if that person didn't have the same issue. The person is putting the brother in a position where he has to deal with the consequences. \n\nSo, the person is not in the wrong for not paying for their own meal because the restaurant didn't fulfill their request. But including the brother's meal as part of the payment refusal might be where they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they took it too far by not paying for their brother's meal as well. But it's a bit nuanced. Alternatively, maybe the manager's response was so bad that the person had grounds to leave without paying entirely. But I think the act of not paying for the brother's meal is where they cross the line. So the answer is A.\n"
