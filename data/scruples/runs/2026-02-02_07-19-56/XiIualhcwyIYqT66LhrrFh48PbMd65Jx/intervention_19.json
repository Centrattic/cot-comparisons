We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who went to a restaurant with their brother and ordered a burger without bacon, as they're Muslim and can't eat pork. The first burger had bacon, so they got a new one. The second burger still had bacon bits, and the manager didn't seem to take it seriously. The author refused to pay for the meal as a \"dramatic effect\" and now is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The restaurant didn't fulfill their dietary request correctly, even after being informed twice. The author's main issue is that the restaurant reused the same plate and didn't properly remove the bacon, which could be a health concern if they had an allergy. They also mention religious beliefs. The manager's dismissive attitude is a problem here.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions: they left without paying for the meal. Restaurants typically expect payment for the food served, even if there's an issue. The author didn't eat the meal, so maybe they shouldn't have to pay. But refusing to pay could be seen as not holding up their end of the transaction. However, the restaurant didn't fulfill their part by not providing the correct meal. But usually, customers are expected to address the issue with the restaurant and not withhold payment as a form of protest.\n\nThe author's argument is that the restaurant didn't meet their request, so they're not paying. But in most cases, the proper recourse would be to contact the manager, ask for a refund or compensation, and if that's not resolved, perhaps take it up with a consumer protection agency. Refusing to pay could be considered unethical because the food was provided, even if it was incorrect. The author is essentially punishing the restaurant by not paying, which might be seen as wrong because the restaurant still provided a meal (even if wrong) and the customer is denying them payment.\n\nHowever, the author's religious beliefs and dietary restrictions are legitimate. The restaurant's failure to accommodate that, especially after being informed twice, is on them. The manager's dismissiveness adds to the problem. But the act of not paying is where the question lies. The author might argue that they were not served the meal they paid for, so they shouldn't have to pay. But in practice, the restaurant still provided a meal, and the customer is refusing to pay, which could be seen as unethical. The correct step would be to dispute the charge if necessary, but withholding payment outright might be in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: if the author had an allergic reaction, it would be a different situation. But since the author didn't have an allergy, some might think the issue is not as urgent. However, the religious aspect is a personal right. The manager's response trivializing the religious belief is a problem, but still, not paying could be seen as the customer's choice.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers if the person's actions were proportionate. Leaving without paying is a drastic step. The restaurant would have likely expected payment regardless. The author could have asked for a refund after the incident. Not paying is a form of protest that affects the restaurant's revenue, which might be seen as inconsiderate. So, the author is in the wrong for not paying, even if the restaurant made a mistake. The proper way is to resolve it through the restaurant's channels, not withholding payment.\n"
