We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a Muslim individual who went out to eat with their brother and ordered a burger without pork (bacon). Despite specifying the request, the restaurant initially sent a burger with bacon, then tried to fix it but didn't properly remove all traces. The manager didn't take it seriously, leading the person to leave without paying for the meal.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The person's religious beliefs prevent them from consuming pork, even if it's been in contact with it. The restaurant failed to accommodate that, even after being told. The manager's dismissive attitude (saying, \"you're not allergic\") is problematic because it downplays the religious significance. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's accurate. The person did ask for a specific dietary requirement, which the restaurant should have respected. The manager's response was inadequate, and the person decided to leave without paying as a form of protest. \n\nLegally, in many places, restaurants must accommodate religious dietary restrictions. Ethically, the restaurant failed to meet their customer's needs despite being informed. The person's decision to not pay could be seen as a justified stand against the restaurant's insensitivity. However, not paying could be considered a breach of contract, as they didn't receive the service they paid for. \n\nBut the manager's attitude was dismissive, which might make the person's reaction understandable. However, leaving without paying could be seen as extreme. Maybe they should have at least paid for the brother's meal if their own wasn't properly handled. But the person's reasoning was that the beliefs were trivialized, so they left to make a point. \n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? The restaurant failed to meet their request, and the manager was disrespectful. The person's reaction was a response to that failure. However, refusing to pay might be seen as going too far, even if the restaurant was at fault. They could have left without paying for their own meal but paid for the brother's. By not paying at all, they might be penalizing the brother as well, which could be considered unfair. \n\nBut considering the restaurant's behavior, maybe the person's action is justified as a form of protest. However, the act of withholding payment is a civil matter. Depending on local laws, the restaurant might be able to charge them for the meal, even if it was mishandled. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the person's right to religious observance is significant. The restaurant should have ensured the meal was prepared correctly. The manager's laughter and dismissal are inexcusable. However, the decision to not pay for the brother's meal as well might be seen as a harsh response, especially if the brother's meal wasn't part of the issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the person isn't in the wrong for leaving due to the restaurant's failure, but the act of not paying for the meal, especially the brother's, might be the issue. But if the brother's meal was also affected by the same service failure, then maybe it's justified. The story isn't clear on whether the brother's meal had issues. The person left without paying for the meal as a dramatic effect, which might be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the person could be considered in the wrong for not paying, even if the restaurant was at fault. Alternatively, if the restaurant was negligent, the person might be in the right to refuse payment. \n\nThe key here is whether the person's actions were proportionate. The manager's response was wrong, but not paying might be a civil issue. In many cases, customers can withhold payment for unsatisfactory service, but that's more for cases where the service wasn't rendered at all. Here, the person did receive the service (the meal) but it was incorrect. However, since the restaurant failed to accommodate their specific request, which they had communicated clearly, the person might have the right to refuse payment. \n\nBut the story says they left without paying for their brother's meal. If the brother's meal was fine, then not paying for that might be unjustified. But if both meals were part of the same order, or the brother's meal was also affected by the same mishandling, then it's different. The story isn't entirely clear. The person left without paying for the meal, perhaps as a protest against the restaurant's attitude. \n\nIn conclusion, the person's main grievance is valid\u2014religious dietary needs not being respected. The manager's response was poor. However, the decision to not pay for the meal could be seen as a justified consumer action, especially if the restaurant failed to provide the service they were paid for. But if the brother's meal was unaffected, then not paying for that could be an overreach. However, the story doesn't specify that the brother's meal had issues. The person might have left without paying for both as a statement. \n\nConsidering all that, the person's actions, while perhaps extreme, are in response to the restaurant's failure and dismissiveness. Therefore, they might not be in the wrong. The manager's behavior was inexcusable, and the person had the right to leave. The not paying could be seen as a consequence of the restaurant's failure, so the person might not be in the wrong (B). Alternatively, if the person should have paid for the brother's meal regardless, then they might be in the wrong (A). But since the story says they left without paying \"for my brother's meal,\" implying the brother's meal was part of the same transaction, then not paying for the entire bill could be justified as a protest. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
