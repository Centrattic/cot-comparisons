We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after an incident at a restaurant. The situation involves a Muslim individual who can't eat pork, including anything that's touched it. They ordered a burger without bacon, but both times they received it, there were bacon bits. The waiter and manager didn't seem to take the issue seriously, leading the author to leave without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's responsibility. They serve food, and customers have the right to expect what they ordered. However, the restaurant did attempt to correct the mistake by remaking the burger. The manager's response was dismissive, which could have been handled better. But did the author overreact?\n\nThe author's main points are about their religious beliefs and the potential health risk if they were allergic. However, the manager dismissed the religious aspect, which is problematic. The author left without paying as a protest, which might be seen as a justified consumer action in some contexts. But not paying for a meal is a legal issue. Even if the restaurant was at fault, refusing to pay could be considered theft or fraud, depending on local laws.\n\nAlso, the author mentions leaving without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\" This seems like a punitive measure, which might not be fair. While the restaurant made a mistake, not paying could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. The author could have requested a refund or complained formally instead.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's failure to accommodate dietary restrictions, especially when explicitly stated, is a breach of service. The manager's dismissive attitude is unprofessional. However, the author's response of not paying might be excessive. They could have left the brother's meal but still paid for their own, or at least sought a resolution through proper channels before refusing payment.\n\nSo, the author has a valid grievance, but the response of not paying for the meal is likely the point where they cross into being in the wrong. It's about balancing the restaurant's responsibility with the customer's right to withhold payment. In many places, customers can refuse to pay if the service was unsatisfactory, but this varies by jurisdiction. However, leaving the brother's meal unpaid as a form of protest might be seen as taking an extreme action. The author's decision was probably inappropriate, making them at least partially at fault.\n"
