We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after this incident.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is Muslim and can't eat pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant didn't properly remove it. They tried twice, both times found bacon, and then confronted the manager. The manager dismissed their concerns, even after the author explained health and religious reasons. The author left without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nNow, considering the options: A is the author is in the wrong, B is not. \n\nFrom a consumer rights angle, the author paid for a service (meal) that wasn't delivered as agreed. Restaurants should accommodate dietary restrictions if possible. The restaurant failed to provide the meal as requested, so the author might have a right to not pay. However, not paying without resolving it could be seen as wrong because it's a business and they might have a right to expect payment unless there's a refund policy.\n\nThe manager's response was dismissive and potentially disrespectful to the religious beliefs, which is bad. The author's frustration is understandable. But walking out and not paying could be seen as a violation of the implied contract of a meal\u2014typically, if you leave, you'd be expected to pay for what you received, even if there was an issue. However, if the meal was not as ordered and the restaurant was uncooperative, the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned leaving without paying the brother's meal. If the brother's meal was fine, maybe the author is responsible for their own meal but not their brother's? Or maybe they split the bill, so the author could still pay their own part. Not paying the brother's might be an overreach, especially if the brother wanted to stay and eat.\n\nBut the main issue is the author's own meal. If the restaurant didn't provide the meal as ordered, and the manager was unhelpful, the author might not be obligated to pay for their own meal. However, in many places, you are expected to pay unless you can prove the service was not rendered. But in some cases, if the restaurant can't accommodate, maybe the customer is entitled to a refund.\n\nThe author's argument is that they didn't receive the service they paid for. The manager was dismissive, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the act of leaving without paying could be seen as wrong because it's a form of refusing to pay for services, which could be a breach of contract. However, if the service was not provided as agreed, maybe it's justified.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might not be in the wrong if they didn't receive the correct meal and the restaurant refused to properly address it. But there's a risk that the restaurant might still expect payment regardless. The author's decision to leave without paying as a protest might be seen as not in the wrong in this context, especially given the religious aspect and the manager's dismissive attitude. So I might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a bit of a gray area depending on local laws and expectations.\n"
