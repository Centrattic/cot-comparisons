We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not paying for a meal because of an incident at a restaurant. The person is Muslim and can't eat pork, which includes bacon. They ordered a burger without bacon twice, but both times they still got bacon, even after the waiter supposedly remade it. The manager didn't seem to take it seriously, laughed, and the person left without paying their brother's meal. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights of the customer. The user claims that they specifically requested no bacon, which is part of their religious beliefs. The restaurant failed to accommodate that request, even after being told twice. The manager's response was dismissive, which is problematic. The user's main argument is about not getting what they paid for and the restaurant not respecting their religious dietary restrictions.\n\nFrom a customer service perspective, the restaurant should have ensured that the meal was prepared according to the customer's specifications. If the manager is nonchalant and doesn't take the request seriously, that's a failure on their part. The user's frustration is understandable, especially when the manager trivializes their religious beliefs by saying \"you're not allergic.\" The user's threat to leave without paying could be seen as a form of protest, but is that justified?\n\nHowever, refusing to pay for the meal, even as a \"dramatic effect,\" is a form of non-payment. The user didn't mention if they tried to resolve it by asking for a refund or if they just left. The brother's meal was also unpaid for, which might be an issue if the brother was just a passive participant and didn't have a problem with the service. The user's actions could be seen as taking the restaurant's failure to a legal or financial level, which might be beyond what's appropriate. \n\nBut considering the religious aspect, in many places, businesses are required to accommodate religious dietary restrictions. If the restaurant can't do that, maybe the user has a right to be upset. However, the user didn't report the issue to a higher authority within the restaurant or seek a formal complaint process. Instead, they just left without paying. That could be seen as wrong because it's withholding payment without a formal dispute process. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a customer is dissatisfied, the proper recourse is to seek a refund or contact a regulatory body, not to refuse to pay altogether. The user's action might be considered a form of civil disobedience, but it's not typically a socially accepted method of resolving disputes. \n\nSo, the user's frustration is valid, but the method of resolution\u2014leaving without paying\u2014might not be the right approach. They should have sought a refund or left a formal complaint instead of refusing payment. Therefore, the user is in the wrong for not paying, even if their initial issue was justified. The manager's unprofessional response was wrong, but the user's retaliation is also a problem.\n"
