We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after this incident. The situation is about the author being a Muslim who can't eat pork, and they had two attempts to get a burger without bacon, which both failed. The manager dismissed their concerns, leading the author to leave without paying their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's responsibility. The restaurant should accommodate dietary restrictions, especially when clearly communicated. The waiter wrote down the request, but the kitchen didn't follow through properly. The second burger had bacon bits left, which is a big problem. The manager's response of \"but you're not allergic\" seems dismissive and doesn't take the religious dietary laws seriously. That's a key point\u2014religious dietary restrictions are valid, even if not life-threatening like allergies.\n\nThe author's reaction was to leave without paying, which is a financial penalty. But was that justified? Restaurants often have policies for such issues. The author could have asked for a refund or a new meal. However, the manager's lack of cooperation might have forced the author into a difficult position. The question is whether refusing to pay is a reasonable response. \n\nOn one hand, the restaurant failed to provide the service paid for, so the customer might have the right to withhold payment. On the other hand, withholding payment for another person's meal (the brother's) could be seen as taking it too far. Also, the author could have tried to resolve it through other means, like leaving a review or contacting the better business bureau. \n\nBut given the manager's dismissive attitude and the repeated failures, the author might feel that their concerns were trivialized, so refusing to pay is a stand for their religious beliefs. However, not paying is a financial hit to the restaurant and might be seen as unfair if the author's brother still got his meal. The author could be in the wrong for not addressing the issue without penalizing their brother's meal. \n\nAlternatively, if the restaurant didn't fulfill the order as requested, the customer isn't obligated to pay for it. But the brother's meal was separate. The author's decision to not pay for both meals might be impulsive, but the core issue is the restaurant's failure. \n\nI think the author's main point is about respecting their religious dietary laws. The manager's dismissive response is a problem. The author might not be in the wrong for holding the restaurant accountable, but the act of not paying could be seen as a mistake because it penalizes the brother as well. However, if the entire meal (including the brother's) was part of the same order, maybe the author's action was a protest. It's a bit of a gray area, but the restaurant's failure and the manager's attitude are on their side. The author might not be in the wrong, but there might be better ways to handle it. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the restaurant didn't provide the service they were paid for, and the author is standing up for their religious beliefs. However, the act of not paying the brother's meal might be a bit extreme. But considering the context, maybe it's justified.\n"
