We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after an incident at a restaurant. The situation involves the author and their brother being Muslim, so they can't eat pork. They ordered a burger, but when they opened it, there was bacon. The waiter got another burger, supposedly without bacon, but there were still bits and bacon on the plate. The manager dismissed their concerns by saying they aren't allergic and laughed. The author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions were justified. The key points here are religious dietary restrictions and the restaurant's failure to accommodate them. In many places, restaurants are supposed to accommodate dietary restrictions, including religious ones. The fact that the bacon wasn't properly removed, leading to the presence of bits and the same plate, suggests negligence or a breakdown in the process. The manager's dismissive attitude (\"but you're not allergic\") indicates a lack of seriousness towards the author's needs, which is problematic.\n\nHowever, the author left without paying for the meal. Refusing to pay can be considered a form of protest, but it's a morally and legally gray area. Even if the restaurant was at fault, not paying for a meal that was already served to the brother might be seen as unfair, especially if the brother's part was correctly prepared. The author might be punishing the restaurant for the mistake, but also the brother, who didn't have an issue. \n\nReligious beliefs are important and should be respected. The restaurant's failure to honor that could be a valid reason for leaving. But the act of not paying could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the issue. The author's intention was to make a statement, but it's a form of civil disobedience that could be considered wrong because they're withholding payment for a service that might have been provided correctly, at least for their brother. \n\nAlso, the manager's response was inappropriate, but the author's decision to not pay might not be the right approach. They could have considered other actions like leaving a review, reporting the incident, or not returning. Refusing to pay could lead to the restaurant taking legal action, which the author might not have intended. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a response to the restaurant's failure and the manager's insensitivity. But the decision to not pay for the meal, even as a protest, is ethically questionable. It's a mix of justified frustration and an ethical problem. The answer would depend on whether the protest is considered a fair response. If the author's brother's meal was also affected, then not paying might be more acceptable, but in this case, it seems only the author's meal had issues. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not paying for the brother's part, even if the restaurant was responsible for the mistake.\n"
