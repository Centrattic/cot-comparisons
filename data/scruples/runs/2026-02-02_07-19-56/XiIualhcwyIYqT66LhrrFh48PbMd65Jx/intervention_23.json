We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Muslim person who went to a restaurant with their brother and ordered a burger without bacon. The first time, the burger had bacon, and the waiter remade it but still didn't remove all the bacon pieces. The author was upset because of their religious dietary restrictions and also health concerns. The manager didn't seem to take it seriously, laughed it off, and offered a new burger. The author refused and left without paying for their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They were clear about their dietary restrictions, which are both religious and potentially health-related. The restaurant didn't properly accommodate their request, even after being told twice. The manager's response was dismissive, saying they took the bacon off, but the author pointed out that this isn't enough for someone with allergies or strict religious rules. \n\nNow, the author decided not to pay for the meal. Is that justified? Well, from a consumer rights perspective, the restaurant failed to provide what was ordered. The customer had the right to request modifications, and the restaurant didn't fulfill that. In many places, restaurants can't force you to pay for a meal if they didn't deliver as per the order. So the author might have a point in refusing to pay because the service was inadequate. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of whether leaving without paying was the right action. If the author and their brother had already left, maybe the restaurant would still expect payment for the brother's meal. The author left without paying, which could be seen as a form of protest. But is that fair? If the restaurant made a mistake, the proper course might have been to talk to the manager, request a refund, or leave the meal and pay for what was correctly served. However, the author left without paying anything, which could be seen as taking a stand against the restaurant's handling of their request. \n\nThe manager's response was dismissive, which is a problem. The author had a right to be upset. But leaving without paying might be considered extreme if the brother's meal was fine. The author might be in the wrong for not paying for the brother's part if the brother wanted to pay. But if the brother was also affected by the situation, maybe they both decided to leave and not pay. \n\nAnother angle: refusing to pay could be a way to hold the restaurant accountable. However, the author might have overreacted by not paying at all instead of trying to resolve the issue. Maybe they should have left the brother's payment but not their own. \n\nIn terms of religious beliefs being trivialized, the author's stance is valid. The restaurant should respect that. However, the method of not paying could be seen as a last resort. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they left without paying for their own meal, maybe not. But not paying for the brother's meal complicates things. If the brother was okay with it, maybe not. But if the brother wanted to pay, the author might have overstepped. \n\nIn conclusion, the author had a legitimate issue with the restaurant's service and their handling of a religious request. The manager's dismissive attitude is a problem. The author's refusal to pay could be a way to express dissatisfaction. Depending on the situation and the brother's consent, the author might not be in the wrong. However, walking out without paying could be seen as extreme. But considering the restaurant's failure, maybe it's justified. So I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
