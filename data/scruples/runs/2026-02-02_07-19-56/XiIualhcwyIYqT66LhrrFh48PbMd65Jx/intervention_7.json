We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they and their brother went to a restaurant, and the author, being Muslim, can't eat pork or anything that has touched pork. They ordered a burger, asked for the bacon to be removed both times, but the restaurant didn't do it properly. The first time they got another burger, but it still had bacon bits on the plate and in the burger. The manager dismissed their concerns, laughed, and said taking the bacon off was enough. The author left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" The question is whether they are the asshole here.\n\nHmm, starting with the author's actions. They were clear about their dietary restrictions due to religious beliefs. When the first burger had bacon, they asked for a new one, and the waiter did that. But the second burger still had bacon. The manager didn't take it seriously, which is a problem because the restaurant should accommodate such requests. The author's refusal to pay for their brother's meal is the key point here. Is it fair to penalize the brother for the restaurant's mistake? \n\nThe author might argue that the restaurant didn't fulfill their part of the service, so refusing to pay is a response to that failure. But the brother's meal was ordered separately. Unless the brother also had an issue, the author's refusal could be seen as holding the brother's payment hostage because of the author's own problem. That might not be fair. The author could have asked for a refund for their own meal and maybe left their brother's to be paid normally. \n\nAlso, the manager's response was dismissive, which is unprofessional. But the author's \"dramatic effect\" of leaving without paying another person's bill could be considered a bit extreme. They might have escalated the situation unnecessarily, but the restaurant's negligence in handling a food restriction (religious or otherwise) is their fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's main issue is with the restaurant, not the brother. They might have felt it was a statement to not pay at all. But taking the brother's meal into account when he didn't do anything wrong complicates it. So, maybe the author is being a bit petty by not paying for the brother's meal when the problem was their own. But the restaurant definitely messed up. \n\nSo, the author isn't solely in the wrong because the restaurant failed to meet their dietary needs, but their decision to leave without paying for the brother's meal might be seen as an unfair punishment. The right course of action would have been to get a refund for their own meal and not affect the brother's. Therefore, the author is partly in the wrong for that part.\n"
