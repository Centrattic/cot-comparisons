We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after this incident. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their brother went to a restaurant. They are Muslim and can't eat pork, including anything that's touched pork. The first burger had bacon, which they didn't want. The waiter was called and a new burger was ordered, but there were still bacon bits and the same plate. The manager didn't seem to take it seriously, laughed, and said things like \"you're not allergic.\" The author got upset, explained their religious beliefs, and left without paying for the meal.\n\nSo, the key points here: The restaurant failed to accommodate a dietary restriction that's based on religious beliefs. The author made their request clearly, but the restaurant didn't fulfill it properly, even after being asked again. The manager's response was dismissive, not taking the health and religious concerns seriously.\n\nNow, the author left without paying, possibly as a form of protest. The question is if that makes them at fault.\n\nIn terms of consumer rights, when a restaurant provides incorrect or inadequate service despite clear communication of a dietary restriction, the customer has the right to refuse payment. The manager's dismissive attitude and failure to address the issue properly might justify the author's actions. However, walking out and not paying could be seen as extreme, but considering the restaurant's negligence in handling a serious request, it might be justified.\n\nReligious dietary laws are important and shouldn't be trivialized. The manager's attitude of not respecting that could be a major factor. Also, the fact that even after correction, the food was still contaminated suggests negligence. The author's main point about the risk of allergic reactions (even if they don't have one) is a valid concern because cross-contamination is a real issue. The manager's response downplaying the situation might have been the trigger.\n\nSo, the author's actions seem reasonable in response to the restaurant's failure to meet their legitimate request. They didn't cause any harm beyond leaving, and the protest was a direct response to the poor service and disrespect. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
