We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault for not paying for a meal. They went to a restaurant, ordered a burger without bacon because they're Muslim and can't eat pork. The first time, there was bacon, so they got another one. The second one still had bits of bacon, and the manager was dismissive. The person left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" Now the question is, AITA?\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The user's situation involves religious dietary restrictions, which are important. They made it clear they wanted no pork, even if it touched it. The restaurant failed to accommodate that twice. The manager's response was dismissive, comparing the issue to an allergy and not taking it seriously. The user then left without paying, which is the main point of contention.\n\nFrom a consumer rights perspective, customers have the right to receive the service or product they paid for. If the restaurant didn't fulfill that, the customer isn't obligated to pay. However, leaving without paying might be seen as a form of protest, but it could also be considered a violation of the agreement made when paying for the meal. But the restaurant didn't resolve the issue properly, so maybe the customer is justified.\n\nReligious accommodation is also a factor. Restaurants should respect customers' dietary restrictions, especially when communicated clearly. The manager's attitude minimized the user's concerns, which could be seen as a failure on the restaurant's part. The user had to explain the health risk of cross-contamination, which is a valid concern, not just religious preference.\n\nThe user's decision to not pay for the brother's meal could be seen as a stand against the restaurant's negligence. However, taking such an action might be extreme. The user might be in the right because the restaurant didn't meet their request, but leaving without paying could be seen as holding others (like the brother) hostage. But the brother might have agreed, so maybe not.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, the restaurant is at fault for not fulfilling the request despite being informed. The customer's response, while perhaps a bit dramatic, is a reaction to poor service. So the answer is likely B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
