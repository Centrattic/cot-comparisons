We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying for their meal. The situation is that the author and their brother went to a restaurant where they can't eat pork, which is part of their Muslim faith. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant didn't remove it properly even after being told twice. The author confronted the manager, who didn't seem to take it seriously, and then left without paying as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue. The author has a religious dietary restriction that the restaurant failed to accommodate. The restaurant's mistake was not just a minor inconvenience but a violation of the customer's beliefs and possibly a health risk if it were a true allergy. The manager's dismissive attitude probably escalated the situation because they didn't acknowledge the seriousness of the request.\n\nThe author's response was to leave without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\" Not paying for the meal is a financial penalty against the restaurant. The question is whether this action is justified. On one hand, the restaurant didn't fulfill the order as requested, which is a customer's right. On the other hand, refusing to pay could be seen as going beyond what's appropriate, especially since the meal was provided, even if it was incorrect. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't eat the meal, so maybe they didn't receive the service they paid for. However, in most restaurant settings, the customer pays for the service of the meal, and if the meal is not prepared as ordered, the customer might have the right to request a replacement or a refund. If the restaurant is unwilling to provide that, the customer might have a case for not paying. But the act of leaving without paying could be considered a violation of the social contract of dining, where you pay for the service even if there's a mistake.\n\nHowever, given the religious significance and the manager's dismissive attitude, the author might feel that the restaurant didn't take their request seriously. The manager's comment about the customer not being allergic could be seen as minimizing the issue, which the author has a right to be upset about. The author's action might be a form of protest against the lack of respect for their religious beliefs.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In the AITA framework, people often look at whether the action was proportionate and if the person acted in a way that's reasonable. The author didn't pay, which is a significant action. While the restaurant was at fault for not following the order, leaving without paying could be seen as a form of civil disobedience. Depending on local laws, the restaurant might still expect payment for the meal provided, even if it was incorrect, unless there was a formal complaint and refusal to resolve.\n\nIn some places, if a customer refuses a meal due to the restaurant's failure, they might still be expected to pay, unless the restaurant is at fault. However, if the restaurant is unwilling to correct the mistake, the customer might have the right to leave without paying. But this can vary by jurisdiction. From a moral standpoint, the author had a right to be upset, but the act of not paying could be seen as taking it too far, especially if the brother paid for both. The brother might be left out of pocket, which complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, the author's action was a stand against disrespect for their religious beliefs, which is a valid concern. The manager's laughter and trivialization of the issue could have justified the author's decision to leave. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their beliefs. However, the decision to not pay might be seen as a financial penalty that's beyond the scope of what's acceptable in a restaurant setting.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right (B) because the restaurant didn't fulfill the order and the manager was dismissive, so the author had a right to leave. But there's also an argument that they should have paid and then filed a complaint or review instead. But given the context of religious sensitivity and the manager's response, the author's action could be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here because sometimes AITA expects that refusing to pay is a no-win situation. Alternatively, maybe A (in the wrong) because the financial penalty is not the right approach. But if the restaurant is at fault, the author could argue that they were paying for a service that wasn't delivered, so not paying is a way to protest the bad service. It's a bit of a toss-up, but I think in the AITA context, the manager's unprofessionalism and the restaurant's failure might mean the author is not in the wrong.\n"
