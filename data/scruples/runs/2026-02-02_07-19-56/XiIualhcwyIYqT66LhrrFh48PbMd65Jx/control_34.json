We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying for their meal after a bad experience at a restaurant. The situation involves the author being Muslim and not eating pork, which includes bacon. They ordered a burger without bacon, but both times they got it, there were bacon bits. They tried to get it fixed, but the manager didn't take it seriously, leading them to leave without paying as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. The author's dietary restrictions are based on their faith, which is a significant reason for them not to consume pork. The restaurant's failure to accommodate this could be seen as a breach of service. The manager's dismissive attitude, especially not respecting religious beliefs and underestimating the seriousness of the issue, plays a role here. The manager even laughed and downplayed the situation, which might have been the tipping point.\n\nNext, the author's decision to leave without paying. That's a financial loss for the restaurant. Typically, not paying for a meal is considered wrong because it's a form of theft, regardless of the reason. However, the author's reasoning is that the restaurant didn't honor their request, so they're protesting the poor service and lack of respect. But legally, the restaurant provided the service, even if it was faulty. The author still consumed the meal, even if it wasn't as requested. \n\nThere's also the argument about consumer rights. The author did their due diligence by informing the waiter, verifying the order, and escalating to the manager. The restaurant's failure to correct the issue properly might be their fault. However, the appropriate response would usually be to seek a refund or compensation, not to not pay at all. \n\nThe manager's response was unprofessional, but the author's action of leaving without paying could be seen as taking the law into their own hands. There might be a better way to handle it, like leaving a bad review or reporting the incident. But the author's choice to withhold payment might not be justified under standard consumer laws, even if the service was poor.\n\nSo, even though the restaurant was at fault for not respecting the religious request and providing a faulty service, the act of not paying the bill is typically considered wrong. The author might have a point in feeling disrespected, but the financial consequences are on them. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
