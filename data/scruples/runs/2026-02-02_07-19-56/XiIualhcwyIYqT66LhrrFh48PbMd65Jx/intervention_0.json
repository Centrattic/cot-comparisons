We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after this incident. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the user and their brother are Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that's touched it. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant failed to comply. The first time, they got bacon. The waiter said they'd make a new one, but even then, there were bits of bacon and the same plate. The manager dismissed their concerns, not respecting their religious beliefs and downplaying the issue. The author then left without paying as a \"dramatic effect\".\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought so, but I need to consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They clearly communicated their dietary restrictions, which are based on religious beliefs. The restaurant didn't honor the request, even after correction. The manager's response was dismissive, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author didn't want to eat there anymore because of the lack of respect for their beliefs. Not paying could be a protest against poor service and non-compliance with their request. In some cases, if a service isn't provided as agreed, the customer might not be obligated to pay. However, walking out without paying could be seen as a breach of contract, as the customer used the restaurant's services (seating, service, food) even if the order was wrong.\n\nOn the other side: The restaurant might have made a mistake, but the author's decision not to pay could be seen as a financial penalty for the restaurant's error, which might be harsh. The manager offered to fix it, but the author refused. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on the jurisdiction and policies. In some places, if a customer refuses service or leaves without paying, they might still have to pay for what they consumed. However, if the main issue is the violation of religious dietary laws and the restaurant's negligence, the author's actions could be justified as standing up for their rights and beliefs.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was to make a point about the restaurant's disregard for their needs. While refusing to pay is a strong move, it's a way to express dissatisfaction. However, in many places, even if the service was subpar, the customer is still expected to pay, unless they can prove the service was completely lacking. Since the author did receive a meal (even if it was wrong), there might be an obligation to pay for the brother's meal. However, the author's own meal wasn't paid for, but the brother's was. So by not paying for the brother's meal, the author is penalizing both. \n\nBut considering that the restaurant didn't fulfill the order correctly and the manager was dismissive, some might argue that the author had the right to withhold payment as a protest. It's a gray area. The key factors are: the restaurant's failure to comply with the request, the manager's dismissive attitude, and the author's response. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the restaurant is at fault for not providing the requested service, then the author's refusal to pay might be justified. However, from a strict contractual standpoint, the customer still has to pay for the service rendered. But since the service rendered was incorrect and the restaurant failed to correct it adequately, the author might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
