We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying for the meal. The situation involves a Muslim individual who couldn't eat a burger because it had bacon, which is against their religious beliefs. They tried multiple times to fix the issue, but the restaurant's staff didn't properly address it. The manager was dismissive, and the person left without paying for their brother's meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's actions. They had a valid religious reason for not eating pork. They communicated their request clearly, but the restaurant failed to accommodate them properly. The manager's response was dismissive, which probably added to the frustration. The person left without paying as a form of protest. \n\nFrom a consumer rights perspective, customers have the right to request modifications to their orders. The restaurant's failure to comply correctly was their fault. The person's refusal to pay could be seen as holding the restaurant accountable, but leaving without paying might be considered unethical or even illegal if it's intentional non-payment. However, the person might argue that the restaurant didn't provide the service they paid for, so they weren't obligated to pay. \n\nHowever, not paying could lead to issues like being reported for non-payment, which might affect their credit or lead to legal problems. But the core issue is the restaurant's failure to meet the customer's dietary needs, which they had a right to. The person's actions were a reaction to the restaurant's negligence. \n\nIn terms of morality, the person is standing up for their beliefs and holding the restaurant accountable. The manager's dismissive attitude (\"you're not allergic\") trivialized the religious requirement, which is a significant issue. The person's decision not to pay could be seen as justified in this context, but it's a gray area. \n\nLegally, if the person ordered a meal and didn't receive it as requested, they might have a right to a refund or to leave without paying. However, the situation is more about the principle here. The person's main goal was to express dissatisfaction with the service, not necessarily to avoid paying. \n\nSo considering all factors, the person might not be in the wrong. The restaurant was at fault for not accommodating the dietary restriction, and the person's actions were a response to that. However, refusing to pay could be seen as a bit dramatic. But given the circumstances, it's more about the restaurant's failure than the customer's wrongdoing. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
