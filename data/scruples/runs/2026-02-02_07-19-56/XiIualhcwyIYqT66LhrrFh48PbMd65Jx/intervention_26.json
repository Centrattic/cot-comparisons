We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after an incident at a restaurant. The situation involves their religious dietary restrictions as a Muslim, specifically avoiding pork and anything that has touched pork. The author ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant failed to accommodate that, even after multiple attempts. The manager didn't seem to take it seriously, mentioning that the customer isn't allergic, which the author found dismissive of their religious beliefs. They left without paying as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The restaurant has a responsibility to accommodate dietary restrictions, especially religious ones. The staff's failure to properly prepare the meal despite clear communication might be a problem on their end. However, the author's response was to leave without paying, which is a form of protest. \n\nFrom a consumer rights perspective, not paying for a meal is typically considered wrong because you're not receiving the service you paid for. However, in this case, the author felt that their religious beliefs were disrespected. There's a balance between holding the establishment accountable and taking a morally questionable action like not paying.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the restaurant fail to meet their obligation? Yes, they provided a meal that shouldn't have had bacon. The manager's dismissive attitude likely exacerbated the situation. But the author's decision to not pay could be seen as taking a stand against poor service, but it's also a breach of the social contract of paying for services rendered. \n\nLegally, the author could have complained or sought a refund through proper channels, but choosing to not pay might lead to legal repercussions. However, the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically. The author might argue that their right to religious accommodation was violated, and the manager's lack of empathy justified their actions. On the flip side, not paying is a form of punishment that affects others (like the brother who might still have to pay) and could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nI think there's a gray area here. The restaurant definitely messed up, but the author's response is a point of contention. If the author had followed up through proper channels (like a review, complaint, etc.), it might be more justified. However, not paying the bill is where the ethical line is crossed. So, the author is in the wrong for not paying, even if the restaurant was at fault.\n"
