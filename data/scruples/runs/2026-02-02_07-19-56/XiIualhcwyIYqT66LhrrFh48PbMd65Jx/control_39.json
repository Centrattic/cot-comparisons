We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not paying for their meal after a problem with their food at a restaurant, specifically a burger with bacon which they can't eat due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is Muslim and mentioned that they can't eat pork or anything that has touched pork. They tried to get the burger remade without bacon, but even after two attempts, the food still had bacon bits. The manager was dismissive, saying things like \"you're not allergic,\" which the author found trivializing their religious beliefs. The author then left without paying for their meal as a form of protest.\n\nNow, the key points here are the right to receive the correct order, the restaurant's responsibility, and the author's actions. From a consumer rights perspective, if a customer specifies a modification (like no bacon) and the restaurant fails to comply, the customer is not obligated to pay for the incorrect order. The manager's dismissive attitude and failure to address the issue properly might have contributed to the author's decision.\n\nHowever, the author left without paying for their brother's meal as well. That part is a bit tricky. If the brother's meal was paid for separately and the author refused to pay their own, that's one thing. But if the author left without paying for both, that complicates it. The original post mentions \"my brothers meal,\" so maybe the author and brother shared the cost. If the author left without paying, even if justified in their own mind, it's still a form of leaving without paying, which is a violation of the restaurant's policy. However, if the restaurant agreed to remake the order and the author refused, then they aren't required to pay for the unsatisfactory order.\n\nThe manager's response was inconsiderate and didn't respect the author's religious beliefs, which is a problem. The author's right to get the food as ordered is valid. But leaving without paying could be seen as a breach of contract or policy. However, in some cases, if a customer is wronged and refuses to pay, it's a judgment call. Some people might side with the customer here because the restaurant wasn't accommodating their needs properly and showed disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently. They could have requested a refund, asked to speak to a manager, or even left a bad review instead of walking out without paying. The act of leaving without paying could be seen as a form of protest, but it's also a potential legal issue depending on local laws. In some places, it might be considered shoplifting, but since it's a meal, it's more about breach of contract.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on cultural and legal contexts. However, in the context of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) community, the person is often judged based on whether their actions were reasonable. The manager's dismissiveness and the restaurant's failure to accommodate a basic request (removing pork for religious reasons) is on their part. The author's right to refuse to pay for an incorrect order is valid, but the act of leaving without paying might be seen as extreme. However, given the manager's attitude and the repeated failure to provide the correct meal, the author's actions could be seen as justified as a form of protest against the lack of respect for their beliefs. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
