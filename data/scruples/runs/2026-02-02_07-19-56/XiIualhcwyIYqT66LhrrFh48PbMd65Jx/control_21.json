We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not paying for their meal. The scenario is about a Muslim brother who can't eat pork, even if it's just touched by pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant didn't properly remove it. The brother ended up leaving without paying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. For Muslims, consuming pork is haram, so the brother has a valid reason to avoid it. The restaurant's failure to comply could be seen as a breach of service. The brother explained his dietary restrictions and even mentioned a potential allergic reaction, but the manager dismissed it. That's a problem because the restaurant has a responsibility to accommodate dietary restrictions, whether religious or medical.\n\nNext, the brother's actions: he asked for a new burger and plate, which was ignored. The manager's response was dismissive, laughing and not taking the issue seriously. The brother left without paying as a form of protest. Now, is this justified? On one hand, not paying for a meal is a significant action. But the restaurant's negligence in handling a specific request might make the brother's decision understandable. However, leaving without paying could be seen as a breach of contract, as the service was provided but not up to the standard expected. \n\nThe key points here are the restaurant's failure to meet the customer's request and the manager's lack of empathy. The brother had valid reasons tied to religious beliefs and health concerns. The manager's dismissiveness might have contributed to the brother's decision. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. The brother could have tried to resolve it differently, like asking for a refund or leaving a review. But the restaurant's negligence is on their side. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as the restaurant didn't fulfill their part of the service agreement. However, there's a counter-argument that not paying is still a wrong action regardless. But given the context of the restaurant's failure and the dismissive attitude, the brother's decision might be justified.\n"
