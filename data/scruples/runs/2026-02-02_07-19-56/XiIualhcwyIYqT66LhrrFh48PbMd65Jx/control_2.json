We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after this incident.\n\nFirst, let me summarize the situation. The person and their brother went to a restaurant. They are Muslim and can't eat pork, including anything that has touched pork. They ordered a burger without bacon. The first time, the burger had bacon, so they asked for a new one. The second burger still had bacon bits and it was on the same plate. They confronted the waiter and then the manager. The manager dismissed their concerns, saying they weren't allergic and just took the bacon off. The author left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo the key points here are: the restaurant failed to provide the requested meal (no pork), the staff was dismissive of their religious needs, and the customer left without paying. \n\nLegally, in most places, when you order a meal, you pay for the service. If there was a mistake, the proper procedure is to resolve it by getting a refund or a replacement. However, if the customer leaves without paying, that's typically considered theft or a breach of contract. But there's also the aspect of the restaurant's fault in not following the order. \n\nReligious dietary restrictions are protected in many places, so the restaurant should accommodate that. However, walking out and not paying could be seen as extreme. The author might have a valid complaint about the restaurant's negligence and lack of respect for their beliefs, but not paying is a civil disobedience act and could land them in legal trouble. \n\nThe manager's response was dismissive, which is unprofessional. The restaurant failed to provide the service they were paid for, but the customer's retaliation might be seen as taking the law into their own hands. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong in terms of their religious beliefs and the restaurant's failure to accommodate them. However, refusing to pay is a separate issue. Legally, they are in the wrong because they didn't pay for the service rendered. Ethically, maybe there's a middle ground, but legally, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't pay, regardless of the restaurant's faults. But maybe the situation is more nuanced. The restaurant made a mistake and the manager was dismissive, so perhaps the author's actions were a justified protest. However, in most legal systems, you can't just decide not to pay because of a dispute. You have to go through proper channels. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, some might argue that the restaurant's failure to provide the correct meal (which they were supposed to do) means the customer isn't obligated to pay, but that's a stretch. Most places require payment regardless of subsequent issues, though you can dispute the charge later. So the answer is likely A.\n"
