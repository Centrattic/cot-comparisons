We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a restaurant issue. The scenario involves a Muslim person who can't eat pork, and their burger had bacon, which they're not supposed to consume. They tried to get it fixed but were unsatisfied, leading them to walk out without paying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is part of a religion that prohibits pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon. The waiter tried to fix it, but the second attempt still had bacon bits. The manager dismissed their concerns, saying they weren't allergic. The author then left without paying, considering it a stand for their beliefs and consumer rights.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The restaurant made a mistake by not following the dietary restrictions. The author tried to resolve it through the waiter and then the manager. The manager's response was dismissive, which the author found disrespectful. The author's action of leaving without paying could be seen as a form of protest or holding the restaurant accountable for their mistake.\n\nBut is it fair to not pay? If the restaurant failed to provide the service they were paid for, the customer might argue they have the right to not pay. However, walking out without paying could also be considered a breach of contract or not following the proper procedure (like not asking for a refund or leaving a review instead). The author might have other options, like getting a refund or contacting the establishment later. By not paying, they might be penalizing the restaurant twice\u2014once for the mistake and again by not paying.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's responsibility is to provide the correct meal as ordered. If they couldn't do that, the customer has the right to refuse the service. The manager's dismissive attitude might have escalated the situation, and the author's refusal to pay could be a way to highlight the importance of respecting dietary restrictions and religious beliefs.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the action. The author's brother might have paid, but the author didn't. If the bill was split, leaving the brother to cover the cost could be unfair. However, the author might see it as a necessary sacrifice to make a point.\n\nI also need to consider cultural and religious sensitivities. For someone with strict dietary laws, the issue isn't just about taste but religious compliance. The restaurant's failure to accommodate that could be a serious oversight. The manager's response downplaying the issue might have been inappropriate, especially when the customer explained the religious aspect.\n\nIn terms of consumer rights, if a service isn't provided as agreed, the consumer can sometimes withhold payment. However, the proper method is usually to inform the establishment and request a refund or credit. Walking out without paying could be seen as extreme, but if the restaurant is unwilling to resolve the issue, it might be justified.\n\nSo, putting this all together: The restaurant made a mistake, the customer tried to resolve it, the management was dismissive, and the customer chose not to pay as a form of protest. The author could be seen as in the right for holding the restaurant accountable, but the act of not paying might be seen as inconsiderate towards their own brother and the restaurant's policies. However, given the context of religious and health concerns being dismissed, the author's actions might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
