We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for not paying for a meal. The scenario is about a Muslim individual who went to a restaurant and had issues with their burger containing bacon, which they can't eat due to religious and health reasons. They tried to address the problem with the waiter and then the manager, but the manager didn't take it seriously. The author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from different angles. The restaurant's responsibility is to provide the service paid for, which includes fulfilling dietary restrictions when requested. The customer informed the waiter about the need to remove bacon and avoid cross-contamination, but the restaurant failed to do so twice. The manager's response downplayed the issue, implying that since there's no allergy, it's not a big deal. However, the user's religious beliefs are equally important and should be respected. \n\nThe author's actions: They refused to pay for their brother's meal as a protest. This is where the debate lies. Legally, if a customer leaves without paying, that's theft, which is a problem. However, the context is that the restaurant didn't honor their request, leading to a breach of service. But walking out and not paying is a form of civil disobedience, which can be controversial. \n\nEthically, the restaurant is at fault for not accommodating the customer's legitimate request. However, the customer's choice to not pay could be seen as taking it too far. They could have asked for a partial refund or left a negative review instead of refusing payment entirely. By not paying, they might be punishing the restaurant, which could be seen as unfair, especially if it's a small business. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's negligence in handling a serious religious and health matter is inexcusable. The manager's dismissive attitude suggests a lack of training or respect for customers' needs. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of response (not paying) could be considered extreme. \n\nThe key points are the restaurant's failure to provide the agreed service and the customer's response. The customer has the right to expect their restrictions to be respected, but withholding payment isn't typically a standard recourse. The appropriate action would be to refuse the second burger, request a full refund, and perhaps leave the meal uneaten. Paying for the brother's meal might not be necessary if the main issue was their own meal, but leaving the brother's meal unpaid seems like a separate issue. \n\nSo, the author's wrong is in not paying for the meal, but the restaurant is also at fault for not fulfilling the request. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since refusing to pay is a legal issue and could be seen as unethical regardless of the restaurant's fault, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong). But if the main issue is the restaurant's negligence, then the author's actions could be justified as a stand against poor service. \n\nBut legally and ethically, even if the restaurant is at fault, the customer is still expected to pay for the service they received. Refusing to pay is not the standard resolution. The proper recourse would be to file a complaint, get a refund, or not return. Not paying is a form of theft, so the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
