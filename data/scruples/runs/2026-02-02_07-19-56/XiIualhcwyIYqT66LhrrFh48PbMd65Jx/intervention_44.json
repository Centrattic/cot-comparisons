We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Muslim person who went to a restaurant and got a burger with bacon, which they can't eat. They asked for a new one without bacon, but the second one still had bits of bacon. The waiter and manager didn't seem to take the issue seriously, and the author left without paying for their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. The author is Muslim, so eating pork is haram (forbidden), and even trace amounts are a problem. That's a valid religious belief. The restaurant should accommodate dietary restrictions if they can. But the restaurant made a mistake twice. The first time, they didn't remove the bacon properly. The second time, maybe they used the same plate or didn't clean it properly, which is a big issue because cross-contamination is a real concern, especially for religious or allergic reasons.\n\nThe author was upset because the restaurant wasn't taking their concerns seriously. The manager's response was dismissive, comparing it to an allergy but not seeing the religious issue. The author left the meal unpaid to make a point. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying.\n\nLegally, not paying for a meal is usually wrong unless there's a breach of contract. If the restaurant failed to provide the ordered meal, the customer isn't obligated to pay for it. But in this case, the brother's meal might have been paid for as well. If the author didn't eat anything and left without paying, maybe they could argue that the service was inadequate, so they didn't receive value for the payment. However, in many places, restaurants can still demand payment even if the food was bad, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author felt strongly about their religious beliefs being respected. The restaurant's negligence in handling a repeated request could be seen as disrespectful. The author's decision to leave without paying might be a protest against the restaurant's attitude, but it's a bit of a drastic measure. However, if the restaurant didn't fulfill their part of the agreement (providing the correct meal), the customer isn't necessarily in the wrong for not fulfilling their part (paying).\n\nOn the other hand, the author's brother might have paid for their meal if they left without doing so. It depends on how the payment was structured. If they were paying together and the author refused to pay, the brother might be stuck with the bill. That could make the author's action impact someone else, which is a negative point.\n\nBut considering the restaurant's failure to accommodate a clear request, especially regarding a religious practice (which should be legally protected in many places), the author's stance might be justified. The manager's dismissive attitude towards their religious beliefs could be seen as discriminatory or at least disrespectful. In such cases, consumers have the right to refuse services that don't meet their standards, especially when it comes to personal or religious needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the restaurant didn't follow the order, the manager was dismissive, and the author left without paying as a form of protest. Legally, it's a gray area, but morally, if the restaurant didn't provide what was ordered and was disrespectful, the author might not be in the wrong. The key points are whether the restaurant breached their duty to accommodate the dietary needs and whether the author's response was proportionate. The author's action could be seen as standing up for their rights and beliefs, which might outweigh the obligation to pay for a meal that wasn't properly provided.\n"
