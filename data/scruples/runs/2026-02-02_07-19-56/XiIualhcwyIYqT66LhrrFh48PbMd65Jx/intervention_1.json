We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their brother went to a restaurant. They're Muslim, so they can't eat pork, including things that have touched it. The author asked for a burger without bacon, but even after getting a new one, there were still bits of bacon on the plate. They got angry, talked to the manager, who downplayed the issue, and then the author left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious dietary restrictions. Being Muslim, avoiding pork is a fundamental part of their faith. The restaurant made a mistake in the first burger, which the author corrected. The second time, even after remaking the burger, there were still pieces of bacon. This is a problem because cross-contamination could make the food haram for them. The author's main issue is not just about the bacon being there, but about the restaurant's attitude towards their religious beliefs and the potential health risks if someone were allergic.\n\nThe manager's response was dismissive, saying that the author isn't allergic, so it's not a big deal. But the author is right to point out that even if they weren't allergic, the restaurant's failure to provide a clean order that respects their religious requirements is a valid concern. The manager's laughter and lack of understanding might indicate a lack of respect for the author's beliefs and the seriousness of food safety issues.\n\nNow, the key part is the author not paying for their brother's meal. The user says they left without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\" That's the main issue here. Legally, if you order a meal, you're supposed to pay for it unless the restaurant is at fault. But in this case, the author claims the restaurant was at fault for not providing the correct order and for their dismissive attitude. However, the brother's meal might not have had any bacon in it. The question is whether refusing to pay for the brother's meal is justified. \n\nEven if the restaurant messed up the author's order, the brother's order is a separate transaction. Unless the brother's meal was also contaminated due to the restaurant's negligence, the author is in the wrong for not paying for it. The brother might have wanted to pay for his own meal regardless of the author's issue. The author's decision to walk out without paying the brother's part could be seen as punishing the brother for the restaurant's mistake, which is unfair. \n\nThe author's reaction to the manager's response might be justified in terms of standing up for their beliefs, but the act of not paying for the brother's meal, especially if it was correctly ordered, is a different matter. Restaurants can't be expected to pay for every order if a customer is dissatisfied, unless there's a clear error on their part. The brother's meal wasn't mentioned as having any issues, so the author's refusal to pay that part might be seen as taking it too far. \n\nSo, the author might have a valid complaint about the restaurant's handling of their request and the manager's attitude, but the action of not paying for the brother's meal is problematic. It's a financial responsibility issue. Unless the brother's meal was also affected, the author is in the wrong for not paying for it. The \"dramatic effect\" part suggests that the author was using the brother's meal as a leverage tool, which is unfair and could be considered unethical.\n"
