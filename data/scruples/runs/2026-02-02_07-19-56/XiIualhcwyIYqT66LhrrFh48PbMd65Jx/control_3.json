We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not paying for a meal because the restaurant didn't accommodate their religious dietary restrictions.\n\nFirst, the situation: they're Muslim, so pork is prohibited. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon. They got a second one, which still had bits of bacon. The waiter and manager didn't seem to take their concerns seriously. The manager laughed and said they took the bacon off, but the user pointed out that even if you remove the bacon, cross-contamination is a problem, both for their religion and potential allergies. They left without paying to make a point.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Legally, if you order a meal and the restaurant doesn't fulfill the request, they might be at fault. However, refusing to pay entirely could be problematic. Restaurants can't be held responsible for every possible cross-contamination, but they should make an effort. The user did try to get it fixed, and when that failed, left without paying.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more complex. The user's religious beliefs are important, and the restaurant's lack of respect for that is an issue. However, walking out and not paying could be seen as a breach of contract. But if the restaurant didn't provide the service they were supposed to, maybe they're not obligated to pay for the meal. The manager's dismissive attitude probably didn't help.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might have valid reasons for their actions, especially regarding their beliefs and the restaurant's failure. But not paying could be seen as extreme. However, given that the restaurant didn't address the issue adequately, maybe they weren't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
