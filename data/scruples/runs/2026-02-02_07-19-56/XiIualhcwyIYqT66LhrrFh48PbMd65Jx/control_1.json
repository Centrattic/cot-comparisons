We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for not paying for a meal. The author is a Muslim who can't eat pork, including things that have touched pork. They ordered a burger, specified no bacon, got it remade, but still had bacon bits. The waiter and manager didn't take it seriously, so the author left without paying as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the consumer rights aspect. The restaurant didn't fulfill the order correctly. The customer asked for no bacon, which is a legitimate request, especially for religious reasons. The first burger had bacon, and even after remaking, it still had bits. The manager's response was dismissive, not acknowledging the importance of the request. \n\nThen, the author decided not to pay for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect\". That's the key point. The question is whether that's justified. If the restaurant failed to provide the ordered meal, the customer might have the right to refuse payment for that meal. But leaving without paying for a sibling's meal complicates things. \n\nWait, the original order was for the author's meal. If the restaurant didn't provide the correct food for the author, they could walk out and not pay for their own meal. But the brother's meal was separate. The author didn't mention the brother's meal being an issue; the brother might have ordered and eaten normally. So, leaving without paying for the brother's meal could be seen as wrong because the brother's part was fulfilled. \n\nThe author's action might be a protest, but it's affecting the brother's part. However, the main issue is the restaurant's failure to accommodate a religious dietary restriction. The manager's dismissive attitude adds to the problem. In some cases, if a restaurant can't meet a reasonable request, the customer can refuse payment for their own order. But taking the brother's meal into it might be crossing a line. \n\nSo, the author might be justified in not paying for their own meal but not the brother's. However, the situation might have been mishandled by the author. Maybe they should have only refused their own meal. The brother might not be at fault here, but the author's decision to not pay for both could be seen as wrong. The answer depends on whether the author should have only refused their own meal. If they didn't pay for their brother's, that's a problem. But if the brother's meal was fine, then the author is not in the wrong for their own part. The question is whether the user is the author in the wrong for not paying for the meal they ordered. The brother's meal wasn't mentioned as being affected, so the author might be in the right for not paying their own, but maybe not the brother's. The original post says they left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect,\" which might be an overreaction. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't pay for the brother's meal, which was properly served. But the restaurant is at fault for not handling the order correctly. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't pay for the brother's meal, which was not an issue. However, the main mistake was their own meal, but the act of not paying for the brother's is the key point here. So the answer would be A.\n"
