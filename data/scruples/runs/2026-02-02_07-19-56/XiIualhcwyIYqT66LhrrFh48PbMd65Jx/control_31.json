We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying a meal after a restaurant messed up their order. The situation is that they're Muslim and can't eat pork, including things that have touched pork. They ordered a burger with bacon removed, but the first one still had bacon. The waiter sent it back, and the second one also had bacon bits and was on the same plate. The manager laughed and dismissed their concerns, even though the user explained health and religious reasons. Then the user left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nSo, the main points here are about respecting religious dietary restrictions and the restaurant's responsibility to accommodate them. The user clearly communicated their needs, the restaurant failed to comply twice, and the manager was dismissive. The user didn't pay as a form of protest. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a consumer rights perspective, customers have the right to request modifications to their orders. The restaurant should ensure the food meets the customer's specifications. Failing to do so, especially after being informed of a mistake, could be a breach of service. Plus, the manager's response was condescending and didn't acknowledge the seriousness of the issue. \n\nHowever, not paying for the meal might be seen as a penalty for the restaurant's mistake. But if the user left without paying, that's typically considered unethical or even illegal, as restaurants provide a service and expect payment. Unless the user explicitly told them they wouldn't be paying from the start, but in this case, they tried to get a resolution first. \n\nThe user's action was a protest, but legally, they are still responsible for paying. The ethical angle might be debated, but the user's main wrong is not paying, even if the restaurant was at fault. The brother's meal is a separate issue; the user didn't pay for it as a consequence. But the brother might have already eaten something, so not paying for their meal might not be fair to the brother if they didn't have a problem with the service. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not paying. The restaurant's mistake is on them, but the customer still has a responsibility to pay for the service received. The user could have requested a refund or complaint, but refusing to pay is crossing a line. The manager's response was unprofessional, but that doesn't excuse the customer's action. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
