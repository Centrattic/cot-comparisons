We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Muslim person who didn't get their meal without bacon as requested, leading to them leaving without paying for their brother's meal.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person is Muslim, so their dietary restrictions are religious. They ordered a burger without bacon, got it wrong twice. The waiter and manager didn't take it seriously, even when the health risks were mentioned. The manager's response was dismissive, and the author left without paying as a protest.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, can you withhold payment for a meal? In most places, leaving without paying would be considered theft or fraud. However, the situation is more about the restaurant's failure to accommodate dietary restrictions. But the customer's response was to not pay their brother's part. \n\nEthically, the restaurant is at fault for not following the order, especially considering religious and potential health concerns. The manager's dismissiveness shows poor customer service. However, the customer's decision to leave without paying might be seen as extreme. Instead of withholding payment, they could have asked for a refund or complained further. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of religious accommodation. The restaurant should respect their dietary laws. If they can't provide a meal that adheres to those laws, maybe they should have refused the order upfront. But in this case, the customer followed up twice, and the restaurant still failed. \n\nThe author's reasoning for leaving without paying is to make a point about their beliefs being trivialized. However, this action affects their brother's part too. Is that fair? Maybe the brother would have paid for his own meal, but the author refused to pay for both as a dramatic gesture. That could be seen as punishing the brother for the restaurant's mistake.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the restaurant is primarily at fault for not fulfilling the order and dismissing the customer's concerns. The author is in a tough spot, but their response of not paying might be excessive. Legally, they owe the money unless they can dispute the charge. Ethically, while the restaurant's actions were wrong, withholding payment might not be the best course of action. It's possible the author is in the wrong because they chose an extreme response that affects others and could lead to legal issues. Alternatively, if the restaurant violated their religious practices, there might be a case for not paying. But I think legally, the obligation to pay remains unless the restaurant agreed to a refund.\n"
