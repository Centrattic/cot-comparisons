We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after an incident at a restaurant. The situation involves religious dietary restrictions. The author is Muslim and can't eat pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant didn't properly remove it both times. The manager didn't take the issue seriously, and the author left without paying, considering it a dramatic effect. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a legitimate reason based on their religion. The restaurant failed to accommodate their request, which is a service issue. However, the author didn't pay, which is a form of protest. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, not paying for a meal could be seen as unethical because the restaurant provided the service (the meal) even if it was incorrect. The author could have asked for a refund or complaint, but leaving without paying might be considered wrong because it's not resolving the issue through proper channels. The manager's dismissive attitude is bad, but retaliating by not paying could lead to legal or financial consequences for the author. They could have left a negative review or contacted customer service instead. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's failure to respect religious dietary needs is a serious issue. The author's actions might be a form of standing up for their beliefs. However, the method of non-payment is a public relations move that might not be effective. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong because not paying is a form of withholding payment for a service, even if defective. The proper approach would be to refuse the meal and request a refund. The author's action could be seen as an overreaction. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
