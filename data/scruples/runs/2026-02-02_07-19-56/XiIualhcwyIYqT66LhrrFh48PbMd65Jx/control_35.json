We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a Muslim individual who couldn't eat pork, so they ordered a burger without bacon. The restaurant messed up the order twice, even after being told. The manager wasn't taking it seriously, and the person left without paying for their brother's meal as a protest. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the religious dietary restrictions are important here. For Muslims, avoiding pork is a religious obligation, not just a personal preference. So the restaurant should accommodate that. The first mistake was understandable maybe, but when they were told again and the second order was still messed up, that's on the restaurant. The manager's response dismissing the issue because there's no allergy seems to trivialize the religious aspect. \n\nThe person's right as a consumer to get what they paid for is a key point. If they specifically asked for something and the restaurant failed to deliver, especially after multiple attempts, that's a service failure. The manager's nonchalant attitude and laughing off the issue probably escalated the situation. \n\nLeaving without paying for the brother's meal could be seen as a form of protest. But usually, when someone doesn't pay, it's considered unethical. However, in this case, the person might be using that as a way to make a point about the restaurant's lack of respect for their beliefs. The dilemma here is between standing up for one's rights and the act of not paying, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nI need to consider if the author had other options. They could have asked to speak to a higher manager, requested a refund, or left a review. But the immediate reaction of not paying might come off as extreme. However, given the restaurant's failure to comply and the manager's dismissive attitude, the author might feel justified. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, withholding payment is a financial penalty against the restaurant. On the other, the restaurant failed to meet their request twice and didn't show proper respect. The author is standing up for their rights and religious beliefs. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural context and the severity of the offense. In some cases, not paying is considered wrong, but if the service was subpar and the establishment was negligent, some might side with the author. The key is whether the restaurant's actions were inexcusable and if the author's response was proportional. The manager's laughter and dismissal could justify the author's frustration. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to uphold their religious beliefs and held the restaurant accountable. The restaurant's failure to comply and the manager's attitude were the main issues. So the answer is B.\n"
