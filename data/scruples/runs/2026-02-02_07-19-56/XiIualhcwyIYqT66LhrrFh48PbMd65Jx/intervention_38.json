We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nSo, the author and his brother went to a restaurant. They're Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that touched it. They usually check, and usually it works, but this time they got a burger with bacon. They asked the waiter, got a new one, but there were still bits of bacon. The manager didn't take it seriously, laughed, and said they took the bacon off. The author argued about the health risks and religious beliefs, and left without paying for the meal to make a point.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, the restaurant's responsibility. The customer has a religious requirement that the restaurant should accommodate. If they can't meet that, maybe it's their fault. But the manager's response was dismissive. However, the author left without paying, which could be seen as unfair because the brother's meal was paid for. Wait, the author didn't pay for their own meal, but also didn't pay for the brother's? Or did they split the bill? The story says \"without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect.\" So maybe the author didn't pay for both meals. That's a problem because the brother might not have done anything wrong. The author's action affects another person's responsibility. \n\nAlso, the manager's response was inappropriate. The restaurant should respect dietary restrictions, especially religious ones. But the author's decision to leave without paying could be seen as a form of protest, but it's ethically questionable because they still received service. Not paying the bill is theft, regardless of the reason. Even if the restaurant messed up, the customer still owes for the food they received. \n\nThe author argues about consumer rights, but in this case, the issue is about their right to have their religious needs met. However, refusing to pay is a separate issue. It's possible the restaurant is at fault for not accommodating, but the customer's retaliation (not paying) is another problem. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for leaving without paying the bill, even if the restaurant was disrespectful. The right approach would have been to leave, maybe not return, and not pay for the meal they didn't consume, but the brother's meal? If the author paid for both, not paying at all is wrong. If they didn't pay for their own meal, maybe that's okay, but the brother's? The situation is a bit unclear on that. \n\nIn any case, not paying the bill is generally wrong, regardless of the dispute. So the author is in the wrong for that action, even if the restaurant's handling was poor. Therefore, answer A.\n"
