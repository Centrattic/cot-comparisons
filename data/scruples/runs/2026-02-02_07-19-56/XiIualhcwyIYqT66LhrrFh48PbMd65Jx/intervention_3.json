We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a conflict at a restaurant. The situation involves the author being Muslim and not eating pork, including things that have touched pork. They ordered a burger, but it had bacon. They asked the waiter to remake it without bacon, and the second time it still had bits of bacon and the same plate. The manager laughed it off, leading the author to leave without paying their brother's meal as a statement. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a different opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They had a valid reason for not eating pork, which is part of their religious beliefs. It's understandable that they wanted the burger to be free of any pork contact. The restaurant failed to accommodate their request properly, even after being told. The second burger still had bacon, and the plate was reused. The manager's response downplayed the issue, which could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe author then refused to pay for their brother's meal, leaving the restaurant. The user thinks this is wrong, maybe because not paying is a big action. But the author's reasoning is about their rights as a consumer and the restaurant not respecting their religious beliefs. \n\nFrom a consumer rights perspective, the restaurant didn't fulfill the order correctly. The author had communicated the allergy (even though they aren't allergic, they used that as a hypothetical) and the religious requirement. The manager's dismissive attitude might have been a trigger. Refusing to pay could be a form of protest against the poor service. \n\nHowever, leaving without paying the bill, even if it's for the brother, might be considered unethical or illegal. The brother might have paid, but the author's refusal to pay their own meal (or both meals) could be seen as a hostile act. The restaurant might still expect payment for the food and service, even if there was an issue. \n\nBut the key point here is the religious accommodation. The restaurant should have been more careful to prevent cross-contamination. The author's actions were a reaction to the restaurant's failure, which might be justified in terms of their beliefs. Still, the refusal to pay is a significant consequence. \n\nIn the AITA context, sometimes the answer depends on whether the person's actions are proportionate. The author was upset and felt their beliefs were disrespected. The manager's laughter might have escalated the situation. But not paying the bill is a strong measure. The brother might not have been part of the issue, so leaving without paying for both meals could be seen as unfair to the brother. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant didn't handle the request correctly, and the manager's response was dismissive. The author's reaction could be seen as standing up for their rights and beliefs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. Legally, they might be expected to pay even if there was an issue. But ethically, if the restaurant consistently failed to accommodate a valid request and the manager was disrespectful, then maybe not. However, the fact that they left without paying the bill at all, even their own, might be the problem. They could have at least paid for their own meal and refused to pay the brother's as a protest, but leaving without paying anything could be seen as holding the brother hostage. \n\nBut the user says the author left without paying for the brother's meal as a dramatic effect. That seems like a personal choice to make a point, but it's not fair to the brother. The author's brother might have wanted to eat there regardless of the incident. So the author acted unilaterally without considering the brother's wishes. \n\nIn conclusion, while the restaurant made mistakes, the author's action of not paying the bill might be in the wrong because it's a financial decision that affects others (the brother) and is a form of protest that's not typically acceptable. The correct course would have been to address the issue with the manager, maybe request a refund, but not withhold payment for their brother's meal. So the answer is A (yes, in the wrong). But I need to check if the religious accommodation is a protected right, which might require the restaurant to make adjustments. If the restaurant failed to do so, the author might have a case, but the non-payment is still a problem. I think the main issue is the refusal to pay, so AITA would lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
