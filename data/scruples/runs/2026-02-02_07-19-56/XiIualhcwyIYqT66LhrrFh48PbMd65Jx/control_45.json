We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user is a Muslim person who went out to eat with their brother. They can't eat pork, including anything that's touched it. They ordered a burger, checked for bacon, and the first one had bacon. The waiter was called, and a new one was made, but there were still bits left. Then the manager was involved, and the user explained their religious reasons and health concerns. The manager didn't take it seriously, laughed, and the user left without paying for the meal as a statement. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the user's actions: They didn't pay for the meal, which is a significant point. The restaurant's responsibility is to provide the food as ordered and accommodate dietary restrictions, especially religious ones. The manager's response was dismissive and showed a lack of understanding. The user had a valid reason for not eating pork, and the restaurant failed to comply with their request, which is a service failure.\n\nHowever, leaving without paying could be seen as taking a strong stance, but is it justified? The user did order a meal and then left, so from the restaurant's perspective, they didn't receive payment. But the user's argument is that the restaurant didn't fulfill the order as requested, so perhaps they shouldn't have to pay. But in most cases, even if there's an issue, the customer is still expected to pay, and the restaurant should offer a refund or credit. By leaving without paying, the user might be seen as taking a stand, but it's technically not paying for the service received, which could be considered wrong.\n\nBut the user's main issue was the restaurant's disregard for their religious beliefs and the health concerns. The manager's response was inappropriate, and the user's frustration is understandable. The act of not paying might be a form of protest against the poor service and the failure to accommodate their needs. However, in legal and typical business practices, the customer still has to pay, and the restaurant should handle the issue through a refund process. The user might have escalated the situation correctly but then took it too far by not paying.\n\nAnother angle: The user mentioned the health concerns, like an allergic reaction. Even if they aren't allergic, the restaurant's failure to handle the food safely could be a liability. The manager's dismissal of the religious aspect is also a problem. The user's decision to leave without paying could be seen as standing up for their rights, but it's a risky move as it involves not fulfilling their part of the contract (payment) for the service.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n1. The restaurant's failure to accommodate dietary restrictions.\n2. The manager's dismissive attitude.\n3. The user's decision not to pay as a form of protest.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user's actions were a response to the restaurant's failure. However, according to standard practices, the user should have requested a refund or left the meal and then not paid, but just walked out without paying could be seen as not honoring the agreement. But the restaurant's fault is significant here. Depending on the jurisdiction, the user might be allowed to withhold payment, but generally, you can't just leave without paying unless there's a specific agreement. However, the manager's actions might have given the user a reason to feel justified. \n\nThe community response to AITA posts often considers the intention and the reasonableness. Here, the user's reason was based on religious beliefs and the restaurant's failure to comply, which is a strong point. The manager's response was inconsiderate, so the user's frustration is valid. The act of not paying might be seen as a last resort after being ignored, but it's still a violation of the service agreement. However, if the restaurant failed to provide the correct meal as ordered, the user might have the right to not pay. \n\nI think the answer here is B (the user is not in the wrong) because the restaurant didn't fulfill their part of the agreement, and the user's actions were in response to the restaurant's negligence, especially regarding religious and health concerns. The manager's dismissiveness added to the problem. The user's protest, while dramatic, was a result of the restaurant's failure to accommodate their needs, which is a valid reason for not proceeding with payment.\n"
