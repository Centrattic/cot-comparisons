We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after this situation. Let me break it down.\n\nThe person is Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that's touched pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but both times the burger had bacon. They explained their dietary restrictions and health concerns, even mentioning a possible allergic reaction, but the manager dismissed them, saying they're not allergic. The author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a show of protest.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the restaurant failed to accommodate a valid dietary restriction based on religious beliefs. The customer clearly communicated the issue, but the staff did not resolve it properly. The manager's response was dismissive, which is a problem. The author left without paying as a consequence. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, not paying for the meal is a problem because you can't just leave without paying. But morally, the restaurant didn't meet their request despite multiple attempts. However, leaving without paying is still an issue regardless of the reason. The author might have a valid complaint, but refusing to pay is a different matter. \n\nThe manager's response was inappropriate, but the customer's solution was extreme. The brother's meal is separate; if the author didn't eat, maybe they could have just left their own meal. But the author left without paying for both, which is a bigger issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the right because not paying is wrong regardless. But the restaurant's fault is on their end. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they refused to pay, which is a problem even if the restaurant was at fault.\n"
