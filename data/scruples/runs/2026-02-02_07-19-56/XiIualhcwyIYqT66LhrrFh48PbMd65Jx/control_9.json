We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after their experience at the restaurant.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that has touched pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but the first one had bacon. They got a second one, which also had bacon bits. The waiter said they remade it, but the manager dismissed their concerns, saying \"you're not allergic,\" and laughed. The author left without paying for their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nSo, the main points are:\n\n1. **Religious Dietary Restrictions**: The author has a valid reason for not eating pork, which is part of their religion. This isn't just a preference; it's a religious requirement.\n\n2. **Repeated Failures by the Restaurant**: The first burger had bacon, and the second one still had bits of it. The staff didn't properly address the request to remove bacon and served the same plate again. This shows negligence or lack of care.\n\n3. **Manager's Dismissive Attitude**: The manager trivialized the issue by saying the author isn't allergic and laughed. This implies a lack of respect for the author's religious beliefs and concerns about food safety.\n\n4. **Author's Response**: The author left without paying for the meal, citing the manager's lack of respect and the restaurant's failure to accommodate their request. They considered this a protest against being dismissed.\n\nNow, considering consumer rights and religious accommodations:\n\n- Restaurants are generally expected to accommodate dietary restrictions, especially when customers communicate them clearly. Failing to do so could be seen as a breach of service.\n\n- The manager's response was dismissive and disrespectful. Dismissing religious concerns is problematic and could be seen as discriminatory or at least inconsiderate.\n\n- The author could argue that the restaurant didn't fulfill the service they paid for (a meal without pork). If the restaurant can't provide that, the customer isn't obligated to pay, especially as a form of protest against the service's inadequacy.\n\nHowever, some might argue that leaving without paying could be seen as taking an extreme action, regardless of the situation. But given the context\u2014repeated failures to accommodate, the manager's dismissal, and the religious significance\u2014it's a valid form of protest. The author might feel that paying would condone the restaurant's behavior.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned leaving a dramatic effect, which indicates they wanted to make a point about being respected. In such cases, consumer advocacy often supports withholding payment if the service is unsatisfactory and the provider is uncooperative.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate grievance, communicated it clearly, and the restaurant didn't address it properly. Their response, while perhaps impulsive, was a reaction to being disrespected and not having their dietary needs met.\n"
