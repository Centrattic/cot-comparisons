We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they went to a restaurant with their brother. They're Muslim, so they can't eat pork, including bacon. They ordered a burger with the bacon removed, but the first time it had bacon, then even after getting a new one, there were still bits of bacon. The waiter and manager didn't take it seriously, and the author left without paying for their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. Since it's a religious requirement, not just a preference, the restaurant should accommodate that. The problem is that the restaurant didn't properly handle the request to remove bacon. The first burger had bacon, then the second one had bits left. The manager dismissed the concern by saying \"you're not allergic,\" which minimizes the religious dietary laws. The author argued that even if you take the bacon off, using the same plate or not fully removing it could still be an issue, especially from a religious standpoint. The manager's dismissive attitude probably made the author feel disrespected.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author was wrong for not paying for the meal. In a typical AITA scenario, the person might be expected to pay if they received the service, but here the issue was a violation of their religious beliefs and the restaurant's failure to accommodate that. The author didn't eat their meal and left without paying as a form of protest. However, in most cases, walking out without paying, even if you're upset, is considered wrong because you still received the service (the meal was prepared and served, even if it was incorrect). The author's brother's meal might have been paid for as part of the same order, but the author's own meal was problematic. But they didn't eat either and left without paying, which could be seen as a form of protest, but perhaps not justified since you can't hold someone else's payment hostage. Also, the manager offered to make a new burger, which the author declined. So maybe the right thing would have been to not eat their own meal but still pay for their brother's and maybe leave a review or complaint. By not paying at all, the author is penalizing both themselves and their brother, which might be seen as going too far.\n\nBut considering the religious aspect, the author might feel that the restaurant's failure to accommodate their needs was a significant breach of service. However, the appropriate response would be to leave a complaint or report the restaurant, but refusing to pay is usually frowned upon unless there's a clear agreement otherwise. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't pay, even though the restaurant's actions were incorrect. The author could have addressed the issue by not eating their own meal, paying for their brother's, and then disputing the charge if possible, but just leaving without paying is generally considered the wrong move in such situations.\n"
