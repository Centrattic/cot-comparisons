We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after a negative experience at a restaurant. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author and their brother are Muslim and can't eat pork, including any food that has touched pork. They ordered a burger and had to remove bacon each time. The first time, the burger still had bacon, and even after getting a replacement, there were still bits left. The manager didn't seem to understand the seriousness, focusing on the fact that the person isn't allergic. The author left without paying as a protest.\n\nNow, considering the religious beliefs and dietary restrictions: The user's religious background makes the situation more than just a preference. It's a significant part of their faith. The restaurant's failure to accommodate this could be seen as a breach of service. The manager's dismissal by saying \"you're not allergic\" downplays the importance of the religious requirement, which the author rightly points out is about more than just allergies.\n\nThe author's actions: They left without paying the bill as a \"dramatic effect.\" While the manager's behavior was unprofessional, not paying for the meal could be seen as going too far. Restaurants typically expect payment regardless of service issues unless there's a clear fault on their end. The author did get a replacement meal, so the total cost might have been higher. However, the manager's refusal to acknowledge the problem and the lack of proper accommodation could justify their stance.\n\nBut legally and ethically, when someone receives a service, they usually have to pay unless there's a dispute or a formal complaint process. The author's refusal to pay might be seen as taking matters into their own hands instead of following proper channels. However, the manager's dismissive attitude and the restaurant's failure to comply with their specific request might mitigate that. \n\nIn terms of AITA standards, the community often considers whether the action was proportionate. The author's decision not to pay was a strong response, but given the manager's lack of understanding and the potential health/religious issue, some might see it as justified. Others might argue that the author should have paid and filed a complaint instead.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not paying, but the circumstances could also be seen as justifying their actions. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering standard expectations of paying for services, the answer might lean towards A (Yes). But if the community values the protest against the manager's attitude, it could be B (No).\n"
