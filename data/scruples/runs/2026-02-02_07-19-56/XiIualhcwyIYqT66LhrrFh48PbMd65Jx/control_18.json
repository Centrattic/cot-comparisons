We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a bad experience. The person is Muslim and can't eat pork, so they ordered a burger without bacon. The first time, the burger had bacon, so they asked for a new one. The waiter said it was remade without, but the second one still had bacon bits and the same plate. They confronted the manager, who didn't seem to take it seriously and laughed. The person left without paying their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nSo, the main points here are about religious dietary restrictions and consumer rights. The person was clear about their request, but the restaurant didn't fulfill it properly. The manager dismissed their concerns, not considering the religious aspect or the potential for an allergic reaction (even though the person isn't allergic, they raised a valid point about contamination). \n\nLeaving without paying is a big decision. Legally, not paying for a meal is considered theft, right? But the person's reasoning is that the restaurant didn't follow their request, so they felt their payment wasn't justified. However, the appropriate action would typically be to contact the manager again to resolve the issue, maybe get a refund or compensation. Slapping the bill on the table and leaving could be seen as a breach of contract since you can't just walk out on a debt. \n\nBut the person's actions were a response to the restaurant's failure to meet their specific request despite being informed twice. The manager's attitude of not respecting their religious beliefs is a problem. The question is whether their refusal to pay is justified. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the customer has a right to refuse the service if it's not delivered as requested, but legally, that's a gray area. The author could be in the wrong because they didn't follow proper procedures first. They could have tried to get a refund or complained further. Also, not paying might be seen as a form of protest, which is debatable. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant clearly didn't honor their request, and the manager's dismissive attitude is unprofessional. The author's actions might be seen as a justified stand against disrespecting their beliefs, even if the legal aspect is against them. \n\nBut I need to consider if there's a way to balance both sides. The author's right to refuse a meal that violates their beliefs is understandable, but the method of not paying could be problematic. So maybe the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't handle it through proper channels and walked out without settling the bill. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the restaurant's negligence and the manager's attitude make the author's actions a form of justified protest. \n\nI think the key is that the author didn't first attempt to resolve the issue through returning for a refund or taking legal action. Instead, they chose to not pay, which is a problem. But the restaurant's failure was significant. However, in most consumer relations, not paying is not the correct approach. So the author is in the wrong for that. But maybe the manager's response was so dismissive that it's the restaurant's fault. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Legally, they probably are because the restaurant is still responsible for providing the service they paid for. But ethically, maybe the manager was in the wrong. \n\nThe answer likely depends on the perspective. But the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't pay for the meal, which is a financial obligation, the author is in the wrong. The correct action would have been to leave, but take the bill to the manager for a refund. So the answer is A.\n"
