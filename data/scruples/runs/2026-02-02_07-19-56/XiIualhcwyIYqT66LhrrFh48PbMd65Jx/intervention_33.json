We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Muslim person who ordered a burger without bacon, but the restaurant didn't properly remove it even after two attempts. The manager dismissed their concerns, leading the author to leave without paying for their brother's meal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's actions. They had a valid reason based on their religious beliefs not to consume pork. The restaurant didn't honor their request despite being told twice. The manager's response was dismissive, not taking the issue seriously. The author then left in protest, not paying the bill. \n\nNow, whether this makes them at fault. Legally, not paying for a meal because of a service issue is generally not acceptable. However, there are ethical considerations. The author's religious dietary laws are important, and the restaurant failed to accommodate that. The manager's attitude was poor, trivializing the request. \n\nBut the author's solution was to leave without paying the brother's meal. That's a financial penalty against the restaurant. In many places, refusing to pay for a meal based on bad service can be seen as unethical, even if the service was poor. The author could have tried to resolve the issue by negotiating a partial refund or discussing with the manager further. Instead, they chose to withhold payment, which could be seen as taking an extreme step. \n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant's failure to provide the requested meal was their fault. The manager's dismissive attitude likely escalated the situation. The author's religious beliefs are valid, and the restaurant should have been more accommodating. However, the act of not paying for the meal, especially the brother's part, might be considered an overreaction. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, they might be, but ethically, the restaurant had a responsibility to address the issue properly. The author's action could be seen as a justified protest, but it's still a breach of social norms to not pay for a meal. The answer might depend on the perspective taken. However, typically, refusing to pay for a service because of dissatisfaction is considered wrong, regardless of the reason. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The key points are: valid reason, poor service, but the author's response was to not pay. That's usually seen as the customer being in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
