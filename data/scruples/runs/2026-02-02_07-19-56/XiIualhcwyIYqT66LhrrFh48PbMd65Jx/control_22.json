We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a Muslim person who went to a restaurant and had an issue with their burger containing bacon despite informing the waiter. They ended up not paying for their brother's meal as a protest.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The user's religious beliefs prohibit eating pork, including any food that has touched pork. They communicated this to the waiter, but the restaurant didn't handle it properly. The manager's response seemed dismissive, focusing on the fact that the customer isn't allergic. The author then decided to leave without paying as a \"dramatic effect.\"\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, restaurants have a responsibility to accommodate dietary restrictions, especially religious ones. The fact that they didn't properly remove the bacon and then dismissed the concern could be an issue. However, refusing to pay for the meal might be a problem. Legally, the customer might be responsible for the meal unless there was a breach of contract or violation of consumer protection laws. \n\nReligious accommodation is important, and the restaurant should have taken the request seriously. The manager's attitude seems to trivialize the request, which is not good customer service. However, the customer's decision to leave without paying could be seen as unfair unless there was a specific policy in place for such situations. \n\nAlso, the user's argument about allergies is a valid point because even if they aren't allergic, the restaurant should still comply with the request. The manager's response of \"but you're not allergic\" is dismissive. \n\nSo, the author's actions were in response to the restaurant not respecting their religious beliefs and mishandling the order. However, refusing to pay might be seen as taking it too far unless there was a legitimate reason to void the payment. \n\nBut in some cases, if a restaurant fails to provide the service they were paid for, the customer might have grounds to refuse payment. However, this can vary by location and specific laws. \n\nIn summary, the author had valid concerns about their religious dietary restrictions not being respected. The restaurant's failure to address this properly is on their part. The decision to not pay might be justified if they were not given the service they paid for. However, the \"dramatic effect\" could be seen as excessive. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the restaurant didn't fulfill the request, and the customer had the right to express their dissatisfaction, even if the method was extreme. The key here is that the restaurant's failure to accommodate a known restriction, combined with the dismissive attitude, supports the author's stance.\n"
