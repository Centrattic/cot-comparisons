We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal. The context is that the author is Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that's touched it. They ordered a burger, asked for the bacon to be removed, but the restaurant didn't handle it properly twice. The manager was dismissive, laughing off the issue and not respecting their religious beliefs. The author left without paying as a form of protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the restaurant's responsibility. They should accommodate dietary restrictions, especially religious ones, which are as important as allergies. The fact that the staff didn't properly remove the bacon and reused the same plate is a problem. The manager's response downplayed the issue, which the author found unacceptable. \n\nNext, the author's actions. They tried to resolve the issue calmly, explained their health and religious concerns, but when the manager was dismissive, they walked out without paying. The argument is that the restaurant failed in their service, so refusing to pay is a way to hold them accountable. However, not paying could be seen as financially punishing the restaurant, which might not be fair if the staff made a genuine mistake.\n\nBut in this case, the manager's attitude was problematic. The author felt their beliefs were trivialized. The restaurant's failure wasn't just a mistake but a systemic issue where they didn't take the request seriously. The author had already left after the second attempt, so the meal wasn't consumed, so not paying is a way to say they didn't receive the service they paid for.\n\nLegally, in some places, you can't force a business to serve you if they can't accommodate your request, but here the restaurant initially agreed to remove the bacon. However, their negligence in doing it properly and the manager's attitude justify the author's frustration. \n\nThe key point is that the author didn't eat the meal due to the restaurant's failure. Leaving without paying is a protest against the poor service and lack of respect for their beliefs. While it's a strong move, given the circumstances, it's a reasonable response to an unacceptable situation. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
