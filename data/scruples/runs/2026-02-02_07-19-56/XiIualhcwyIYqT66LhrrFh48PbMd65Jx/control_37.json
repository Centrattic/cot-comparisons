We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that they went to a restaurant with their brother, being Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that touched it. They ordered a burger without bacon, but both times the staff didn't properly remove the bacon. The manager didn't take it seriously, laughing and saying they took the bacon off. The author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had valid religious reasons for not wanting pork. They tried to communicate this to the waiter, who made a second burger, but it still had bacon bits. Then the manager dismissed their concerns, trivializing their religious beliefs. The author left without paying as a form of protest.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not paying. Let's break it down. The restaurant made mistakes in preparing the meal despite clear instructions. The author tried to resolve it but the staff was unhelpful. The manager's response was dismissive and even laughed, which is problematic.\n\nBut leaving without paying is a serious action. In most places, not paying for a meal is considered theft, even if it's in protest. The author might have a right to be upset, but their solution could be seen as illegal. However, some might argue that the manager's failure to respect their religious needs justified the action. But legally, that might not matter. The author's brother didn't specify not to pay, so it's unclear if the brother is also avoiding payment. The author's choice to leave without paying could be seen as wrong because it's a financial loss to the restaurant. But the restaurant's negligence in handling a dietary requirement, especially a religious one, is also at fault.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author had the right to refuse a meal that violated their beliefs, but the method of not paying is questionable. They could have requested a refund first. The fact that the manager was dismissive adds to the frustration, but the action of leaving without paying might not be the right approach. So, the author is not in the wrong for refusing the meal, but the decision not to pay is where the gray area is. However, the answer is likely A (they are in the wrong) because walking out without paying is not acceptable, even if the restaurant made a mistake. They should have asked for a refund or called for a supervisor before leaving.\n"
