We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a mishap with bacon in their burger. They mentioned being Muslim and the dietary restrictions related to pork. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author clearly communicated their dietary restrictions, even specifying that the food can't have touched pork. The first burger had bacon, which they found out and asked for a replacement. The waiter said it was a new one, but the second had bacon bits and even on the plate. The manager dismissed the concern, saying they took the bacon off, and laughed, which the author found trivializing.\n\nThe author then left without paying for their brother's meal as a \"dramatic effect.\" The question is whether this action is justified. From a restaurant policy standpoint, if the food was ordered incorrectly despite clear communication, the restaurant is responsible. The manager's response seems dismissive and not respectful of the author's religious beliefs, which are strict. The author's refusal to pay for the meal could be seen as a form of protest, but is it right?\n\nIn many places, if a customer requests a specific modification and the restaurant fails to comply, the customer might have a right to a refund or replacement. However, refusing to pay for the brother's meal adds a layer of complexity. The brother didn't ask for the same modifications, so maybe the author is conflating their own issue with the brother's meal. \n\nLegally, the author is responsible for their own order, but the brother's meal was part of the same transaction. If the author left without paying for the brother's meal, that's typically considered a breach of contract or even theft, depending on local laws. The manager might not be responsible for the brother's order, but the author's action could be seen as holding the entire bill hostage because of their own issue. \n\nEthically, the author is standing up for their beliefs and the restaurant's failure to accommodate them. However, the decision to not pay for the brother's meal might be seen as unfair to the brother, especially if he didn't request any changes. The author could have handled it by only refusing their own part of the bill. \n\nSo, the main points are the restaurant's fault for not following the order and the manager's dismissive attitude. The author's refusal to pay the entire bill, including the brother's, might be where the wrong comes in. They could be in the wrong for not just their own meal but also the brother's, which wasn't part of the problem. Alternatively, if the restaurant's failure to comply with a specific request is considered a breach, the author might have a right to protest. But the action taken (not paying the entire bill) is questionable. \n\nI need to decide if the author's decision to not pay the brother's meal is justified. Since the brother's meal wasn't the issue, the author might be overstepping. The manager's response was inappropriate, but the author's action could be seen as a form of protest that's too extreme. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not paying the entire bill, even if the restaurant made a mistake. They should have addressed their own meal and perhaps refused to pay for that only, but taking the brother's meal into it is where the responsibility lies with the author.\n"
