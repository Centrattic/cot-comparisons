We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after a dispute at a restaurant. The situation involves the author being Muslim and not eating pork, which includes bacon. They ordered a burger and asked to have the bacon removed, but the first replacement still had bacon bits and was on the same plate. The waiter and manager didn't seem to take the issue seriously, leading the author to leave without paying their brother's bill as a \"dramatic effect.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a valid reason for not eating pork, both religious and health-related (allergies). The restaurant staff failed to accommodate their request, and when confronted, the manager dismissed their concerns, saying they weren't allergic. The author then refused to pay the bill as a protest. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, refusing to pay for a meal typically means you're responsible for the cost of the food you consumed. If the author didn't eat anything due to the error, they might not be obligated to pay for the meal they ordered. However, the brother's meal was paid for as well. The author left without paying the brother's part, which could be seen as a financial burden on the brother or the restaurant. \n\nEthically, the author's actions are a response to the restaurant's failure to meet their dietary restrictions and the manager's dismissive attitude. The religious aspect is important here; the author's beliefs are a core part of their identity, and the restaurant's staff didn't respect that. The manager's comment about not being allergic seems to trivialize the religious aspect, which is a mistake. \n\nHowever, the decision to leave without paying the brother's meal could be problematic. The brother might have wanted to pay for his own food, and the author's choice to not pay could be seen as a self-serving move that affects another person. The author's reasoning is to make a statement, but it's unclear if the brother agreed with this action. \n\nIn terms of consumer rights, the author is correct that if they paid for a meal without pork, they should get exactly that. The restaurant's mistake led to the food not being prepared as ordered. However, the act of leaving without paying introduces a financial consequence. The author might be justified in not paying for their own meal but taking the brother's into account complicates things. \n\nThe manager's response was unprofessional, especially since the restaurant serves diverse customers. Failing to address the issue properly could lead to loss of good customers and damage to reputation. The author's frustration is understandable, but the method of protest might be seen as extreme, especially involving another person's payment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author has a right to be upset and to demand their meal as ordered. However, the choice to not pay the bill, particularly the brother's part, might be seen as inconsiderate or unfair. The correct action would be to leave without paying for their own meal but perhaps to let the brother pay for his if he wanted to. The author's decision to take the brother into it might be the part where they are in the wrong.\n"
