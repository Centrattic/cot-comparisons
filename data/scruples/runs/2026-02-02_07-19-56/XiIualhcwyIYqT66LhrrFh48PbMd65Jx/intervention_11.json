We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not paying for a meal after an incident at a restaurant. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is Muslim and can't eat pork or anything that's touched pork. They ordered a burger and found bacon both times, even after the waiter supposedly remade it. They tried to resolve it with the waiter and then the manager, but the manager dismissed their concerns, saying they could just take the bacon off. The person then left without paying for their brother's meal as a dramatic effect.\n\nSo, the key points here are: religious dietary restrictions, the restaurant's failure to accommodate those restrictions despite being informed, and the person's response of leaving without paying.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the person's perspective, they have a legitimate religious requirement. They informed the restaurant twice and the staff still served bacon-infused food. The manager's dismissive attitude (\"you're not allergic\") might be part of the problem, as they're not respecting the religious aspect. The person's argument that food that's been sent back and modified isn't safe or acceptable, especially for religious reasons, is valid. They might feel wronged and that their beliefs were trivialized. Leaving without paying could be seen as a protest against poor service that violated their beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, restaurants do have a right to expect payment for services rendered. If the person left without paying, it could be considered theft, regardless of the reason. Even if the restaurant made a mistake, the customer is still responsible for their meal unless the restaurant agrees to waive the charge. The person's response might be seen as extreme, even if justified in their mind. They could have demanded a refund or left a negative review, but withholding payment is a financial loss to the restaurant.\n\nThe question is whether the person's actions were disproportionate. They did try to resolve the issue calmly, explained their religious needs, and the manager didn't take it seriously. However, refusing to pay is a financial consequence. In some places, refusing to pay could be illegal, even if the business is at fault. The person's right to a meal that meets their dietary restrictions is important, but so is the restaurant's right to be paid for the service provided.\n\nLooking at similar situations, if a customer has a legitimate reason for not receiving the service they paid for, they might be justified in not paying. However, proving that the restaurant failed to accommodate their needs could be necessary. If the person can show that the restaurant didn't fulfill the order despite clear instructions, they might have a case. But in practice, it's often expected that customers pay and then dispute the charge through proper channels (like returning for a refund or disputing the payment through their bank).\n\nIn this case, the person left without paying. While their frustration is understandable, especially with the manager's dismissive attitude, the act of not paying could be seen as wrong because it's a financial loss to the restaurant. The proper course of action would have been to refuse the meal, ask for a refund, and leave if necessary, but still pay if that's the only way to get the refund. Alternatively, they could have left the meal and the money as a protest, but that's more of a symbolic act and might not be feasible.\n\nSo, while the restaurant did fail to meet the customer's reasonable request, the customer's decision to not pay might cross a line. They could be in the wrong for not following the proper process of seeking a refund rather than refusing to pay outright. The person might have a valid point about the restaurant's negligence, but their response could be considered disproportionate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
