We're Muslim, so we cant eat pork. We can't even eat things that have touched pork. While we we order we usually verify if something has pork and ask them to take it off.  Usually this works, however this time it didnt. I opened up my burger to find bacon. I was a little annoyed and called over our waiter who got us another order. I verified with the waiter that it had been a brand new burger and they didn't just take the bacon off. Well I open up my burger again and it's got little tiny bits of bacon in it and there are pieces of bacon on the plate because they apparently can't be bothered to take it all off. I get pissed and call the waiter over and verify they said to remake the burger with no bacon and apparently that's what she did. I walk around trying to find a manager and finally spot her. I tell her my issue very calmly, the health concerns of reserving food that got sent back, and I even tell her my religious background to help her understand and she doesn't seem to be understanding the problem. What if I had an allergic reaction to the bacon? Would she still think taking bacon off and sending it back out is a good thing? Her response was \n\n\"but you're not allergic.\" \n\n\"That's not the point, I'm paying for a service and I have a right as a consumer to get what I paid for, not anything less. I told your waiter, and she wrote it down right infront of me that I want a new burger with no bacon on a new plate and shes sent back with the same burger on the same plate and they didn't even take all of the bacon pieces off. And because you're so nonchalant about reserving food that has been sent back because something is wrong, this mentality has gone down the chain of command.\" \n\nAnd shes starting to laugh because apparently it's not that serious. \n\nHer: \"But they took the bacon off.\"\nMe: \"So what if they took the bacon off? If I was allergic to bacon do you think just taking the bacon off would be sufficient? Or is it just that you don't respect my religious beliefs that state to not eat bacon?\" \nHer: \"Its not like you're allergic. I'll make you a new burger and make sure it doesnt have bacon.\" \nMe: \"No thanks, I don't want to eat anywhere my beliefs are trivialized.\"\n\nAnd I left without paying for my brothers meal because dramatic effect. I'd like to say I slammed the door on my way out but it's one of those doors that close silently.\n\nSo AITA?? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not paying for the meal after this incident. The situation is that they went to a restaurant, are Muslim and can't eat pork. They ordered a burger without bacon, but even after two attempts, the restaurant didn't properly remove the bacon. The manager downplayed the issue, and the author left without paying as a show of protest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author had a legitimate request based on their religious beliefs. The restaurant failed to accommodate that, which could be seen as a failure to provide the service they were paying for. The manager's dismissive attitude probably added to the frustration. When the author left without paying, was that a justified protest or an overreaction?\n\nFrom a consumer rights perspective, the author paid for a meal that wasn't as ordered, so they might have a case in demanding a refund. But by walking out without paying, they're refusing to pay for both their and their brother's meals. That could be seen as wrong because the brother's meal wasn't the issue. The author might be holding the restaurant accountable for their failure, but it's a bit of a tit-for-tat situation.\n\nAlso, the manager's response was dismissive, which is unprofessional. The author's right to have their dietary restrictions respected is important. However, refusing to pay as a form of protest is a strong move. In some places, leaving without paying could be considered theft or fraud. So legally, the author might be in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the restaurant didn't fulfill their part of the service, so the author isn't necessarily obligated to pay for a service that wasn't rendered properly. But the brother's meal wasn't at fault, so maybe the author shouldn't have refused to pay for that. The line between protest and wrongdoing can be blurry here.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to request a meal without pork, the restaurant's failure to comply, the manager's dismissiveness, and the author's decision to leave without paying. The author's action was a form of protest against the restaurant's negligence, but it's a bit extreme. However, if the restaurant didn't provide the service they were paid for, the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a tricky situation where both sides have some issues. The author might not be in the wrong because the restaurant didn't meet their obligations, but the method of not paying could be seen as a breach of etiquette. So, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong, but the answer is B.\n"
