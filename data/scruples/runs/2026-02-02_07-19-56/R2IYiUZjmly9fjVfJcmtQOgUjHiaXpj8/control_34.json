We were sitting on the sidewalk away from the crowds working on sit and down with distractions like other dogs/people and many loud noises. \n\nAn older black man opened his door about 5 feet from us so I got up and stepped another 5 feet away saying something like \u201csorry sir he\u2019s friendly\u201d the guy said \u201c that\u2019s a pit bull, I don\u2019t like them, they can\u2019t be trusted!\u201d to which I responded, \u201cisn\u2019t that like me saying I don\u2019t like black people, they can\u2019t be trusted?\u201d  He looked surprised and backpedaled saying \u201cI only like little dogs\u201d I then said \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d so Reddit am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for comparing the older man's dislike of pit bulls to racism.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man had a negative comment about pit bulls, saying they can't be trusted. The author responded by comparing that to racial prejudice. The man then tried to backtrack by saying he only likes small dogs.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the comparison is valid. Comparing prejudice against a dog breed to racism is a bit of a stretch because they are different types of discrimination. However, the author is pointing out that both are forms of stereotyping and bias. \n\nThe man's statement about pit bulls could be seen as a stereotype, and the author is challenging that by drawing a parallel to racial stereotyping. While the comparison might not be perfect, the intent is to highlight the unfairness of making assumptions based on breed, similar to racial assumptions.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that equating breed bias with racism is an exaggeration because the contexts are different. But the author's intent was to confront the man's prejudice, which is a valid response to challenge harmful stereotypes.\n\nThe man did backpedal, suggesting he realized his comment was inappropriate. The author's response was a direct challenge, which could be seen as a way to educate or confront the man's bias. \n\nIn terms of social norms, calling out prejudice is generally seen as right. However, the method might be debated. Was the comparison the best way? Maybe not, but the act of challenging bias isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
