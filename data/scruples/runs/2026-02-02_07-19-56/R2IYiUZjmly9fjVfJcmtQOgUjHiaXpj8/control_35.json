We were sitting on the sidewalk away from the crowds working on sit and down with distractions like other dogs/people and many loud noises. \n\nAn older black man opened his door about 5 feet from us so I got up and stepped another 5 feet away saying something like \u201csorry sir he\u2019s friendly\u201d the guy said \u201c that\u2019s a pit bull, I don\u2019t like them, they can\u2019t be trusted!\u201d to which I responded, \u201cisn\u2019t that like me saying I don\u2019t like black people, they can\u2019t be trusted?\u201d  He looked surprised and backpedaled saying \u201cI only like little dogs\u201d I then said \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d so Reddit am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a dog breed comment and a racial comparison.\n\nFirst, the man at the parade says something about pit bulls not being trustworthy. The person responds by comparing it to racism against Black people. The key here is whether the comparison is fair or if the author overstepped.\n\nThe man's comment is about a specific dog breed, which he might have negative views on, maybe due to past experiences or stereotypes. The author points out the similarity to racial prejudice, which is a serious issue. Comparing breed bias to racism can be a strong analogy, but maybe it's a stretch. However, the author's intention was to highlight the unfairness of stereotyping.\n\nIs the analogy valid? Some might argue that comparing breed prejudice to racism is a form of equating different forms of discrimination, which can be controversial. Others might see it as a necessary comparison to emphasize the harm in both cases.\n\nThe man then backtracks, saying he only likes small dogs. The author responds with understanding. The main question is whether the author was in the wrong for making that comparison. \n\nIn terms of social norms, calling out prejudice is generally seen as right. But the method here was direct and confrontational. Depending on the context, the author's response could be seen as a valid challenge to the man's bias, using a parallel to a serious social issue. However, some might argue that the comparison isn't entirely accurate, which could come off as dismissive or inflammatory.\n\nSo, considering the intent to address prejudice and the context of a public event, the author's response is likely justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). However, if the comparison is seen as forcing the analogy too much, there's a case for A. But given that the author's response aimed to confront the man's bias and promote understanding, B seems more appropriate.\n"
