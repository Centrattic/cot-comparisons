We were sitting on the sidewalk away from the crowds working on sit and down with distractions like other dogs/people and many loud noises. \n\nAn older black man opened his door about 5 feet from us so I got up and stepped another 5 feet away saying something like \u201csorry sir he\u2019s friendly\u201d the guy said \u201c that\u2019s a pit bull, I don\u2019t like them, they can\u2019t be trusted!\u201d to which I responded, \u201cisn\u2019t that like me saying I don\u2019t like black people, they can\u2019t be trusted?\u201d  He looked surprised and backpedaled saying \u201cI only like little dogs\u201d I then said \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way\u201d so Reddit am I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person took their pit bull to a parade and was working on training. An older black man parked nearby and expressed dislike for pit bulls. The author then compared that dislike to racism by saying it's like saying they don't like black people. The man then backpedaled, saying he only likes small dogs. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for making that comparison.\n\nFirst, the context: The man was close to the dog, which the author had to move away from. The man's comment about pit bulls not being trustworthy. The author's response was to equate breed-based distrust to racism based on race.\n\nNow, is the comparison fair? People often compare prejudice based on characteristics like race, gender, or breed. In this case, the man's statement about pit bulls being untrustworthy is a form of breed-based prejudice. Comparing that to racism is a way to highlight the unfairness of such prejudice. However, some might argue that it's not exactly the same because racism is systemic and more severe. But the analogy is used to point out that both involve making judgments based on group membership rather than individual merit.\n\nThe author's response was direct but not aggressive. They used a parallel to challenge the man's prejudiced view. The man did backpedal, which might indicate he realized his comment was inappropriate. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author was defending their dog against a prejudiced remark. The comparison is a common rhetorical device to draw attention to the issue. Whether the author is in the wrong would depend on if the analogy was inappropriate or crossed a line. Since the author didn't escalate the situation and made a point to highlight the prejudice, it seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
