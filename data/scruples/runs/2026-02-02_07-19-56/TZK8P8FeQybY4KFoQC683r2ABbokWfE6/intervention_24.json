We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a year-long relationship, they only see each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. She wants him to tell her while he does it, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl's request is for immediate communication, which she says helps her feel calmer. That makes sense because she might be worried about his porn use and wants reassurance. Open communication is usually important in relationships. But the guy is uncomfortable with the idea of telling her while he's doing it because it shames him. He wants to keep it private and move on after.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy is being unreasonable. On one hand, respecting each other's feelings and boundaries is key. If she's asking for something that makes her feel secure, isn't it his responsibility to accommodate that? However, there's also the aspect of personal privacy and comfort. If the act of informing her in real-time makes him feel ashamed, maybe there's a middle ground. Maybe he could check in with her after the fact, but not during. Or they could discuss why she needs the immediate information. Maybe her need for real-time updates is rooted in insecurity or jealousy, and addressing that could help both of them.\n\nAnother angle is the age difference and the fact that they're young. At 17 and 19, they might be navigating relationship dynamics for the first time. Communication styles might not be fully developed. The girlfriend might not realize that his discomfort is genuine, and he might not understand her need for constant reassurance. It's possible that the author isn't at fault because he's being honest about his feelings, but he could still explore ways to make her feel secure without compromising his own comfort.\n\nBut then again, if she's already accepted that he watches porn, why does she need the exact timing? Maybe there's an underlying issue here. If the author refuses to discuss it at all, even after the fact, that could be a problem. But the question is about telling her while doing it. The act of immediately informing her might be more about her emotional needs than the content itself. The author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional well-being, which could be a point against him.\n\nHowever, the author is clear that he feels ashamed. That's a valid emotion. If he's being forced into a situation where he has to share something he's uncomfortable with, that's also a problem. So maybe the right approach is for them to find a compromise. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to tell her in real-time if that's making him uncomfortable. Instead, he could communicate with her about his feelings and see if they can find another way to address her need for reassurance.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings of discomfort and shyness. However, the responsibility is on both sides to communicate and find a solution. Since the question is a yes or no, based on the given options, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he's being honest about his feelings and the situation isn't clearly his fault. But I'm a bit conflicted because relationships require compromise. Still, given the information, the answer is B.\n"
