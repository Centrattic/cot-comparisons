We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for a year. The guy is 19, the girl is 17. They don't see each other much because of distance. He watches porn during the week when they're apart. She's okay with him watching it but wants him to tell her right when he does it. He's uncomfortable because it makes him feel ashamed and he wants to just move on from it.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong for not agreeing to her request. The user thinks he is in the wrong, but wants to hear different perspectives.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girl is asking for transparency to feel secure. In relationships, trust and communication are important. If she feels that knowing when he watches porn helps her feel more at ease, then maybe there's a valid reason for her request. But on the other hand, the guy feels that this is a private activity he does for himself, and sharing it right away makes him uncomfortable. It's a personal choice and he might be within his right to set boundaries.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could communicate with her about his feelings, explaining why he doesn't want to tell her immediately. Maybe they could find another way for her to feel secure without him having to disclose exact times. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not about possible solutions.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and boundaries. If the girl's request is causing him significant discomfort and shame, then he might not be wrong to set that boundary. However, if she's asking for transparency and he's refusing without any communication, that could be a problem. The fact that he's already being honest about watching porn (she's accepted it) shows some level of openness, but her request goes further into real-time disclosure.\n\nAnother angle: some people might argue that if she's uncomfortable with his porn use, maybe she should address deeper insecurities. But that's not really the question here. The question is about whether not telling her immediately is wrong. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, honesty is important, but so is respecting each other's privacy. Watching porn is a common activity, and the act itself isn't necessarily problematic unless it causes harm. The issue here is the timing and method of disclosure. Since the guy is already being honest about his porn use, but not the exact timing, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's not hiding it entirely. However, if she's feeling insecure and needs more reassurance, his refusal to disclose might be seen as not addressing her feelings adequately.\n\nBut the guy also has a right to privacy regarding his personal habits. So it's a balance. Depending on cultural or personal beliefs, some might say he should comply with her request for full transparency, while others might side with him wanting to keep that detail private.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the refusal to disclose exact times is causing harm or disrespect. If the girl's need for reassurance is reasonable, then he might need to find a way to accommodate her. But if he's not violating any agreed-upon boundaries and it's not affecting their relationship negatively, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer probably is B, he's not in the wrong, because he's maintaining privacy of a personal activity that doesn't directly impact her, and he's already being honest about it. However, communication is still key, and maybe the problem lies in not discussing it further rather than the act of not telling immediately.\n"
