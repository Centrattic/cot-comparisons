We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who have been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. She wants him to tell her when he's watching porn, while he does it, to make her feel better. He finds this uncomfortable and doesn't want to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. They're in a long-distance situation, which can be more challenging for communication and trust. The girlfriend wants transparency, which is a common request in relationships to build trust. However, the guy feels ashamed and uncomfortable sharing this information in real-time.\n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, it's about mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend's request is about emotional reassurance, but the guy's discomfort is also valid. The key is whether his refusal is unreasonable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to comply with her request.\n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. For example, maybe he could tell her after the fact instead of in real-time, or they could discuss boundaries that respect both their feelings. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's not hurting her intentionally and they haven't reached a compromise, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if communication is essential in a relationship, then not being honest could be an issue. But the situation is complex. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because personal boundaries and comfort levels are important, but maybe A if the lack of communication is causing harm. I need to decide based on the information given. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Let me think again. The girlfriend wants to know during the act, which is unusual. Maybe that's the problem. The guy's right to privacy, so B.\n"
