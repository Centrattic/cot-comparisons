We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the 19M guy) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. They've been together for a year, only see each other on weekends, and he studies in a different city. She wants to be told in the moment he's watching it, but he feels ashamed and wants privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's request is about feeling calm knowing when he's watching porn. It's her way of managing her discomfort, maybe to avoid feeling ignored or to schedule her own time. On the other hand, the author feels that it's a private activity and doesn't want to be embarrassed. Watching porn is a common behavior, and some people might find discussing it intrusive.\n\nIs it reasonable for her to ask for that? It might depend on their communication style. If they've discussed boundaries before and she's now changing her stance, maybe there's a need for compromise. But he's not hiding it; he's just not disclosing the exact times. He's already accepted that she knows he does it, just not the specifics. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author's discomfort is valid. If he's already honest about watching porn, but not the timing, is that a problem? She's asking for more information than he's comfortable sharing. So, is he in the wrong? Probably not. People have different privacy needs. It's a matter of negotiation. There's no right or wrong, just different perspectives. So the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
