We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants the guy to tell her when he's watching porn, but he's uncomfortable with that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend, who is 17 and they've been together for a year, wants to know exactly when he watches porn. She says it calms her to know. On the other hand, the guy, 19, feels ashamed and uncomfortable. He wants to keep it private and just get it out of his mind after doing it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think it's important to look at communication and mutual respect. In a relationship, both partners should feel comfortable and respected. The girlfriend's request is about transparency, which is understandable. However, the guy has valid reasons for his discomfort. Watching porn is a personal activity, and some people might find it embarrassing to discuss in real-time.\n\nThe key here is whether the request is reasonable. If the girlfriend is asking for something that makes the guy feel ashamed, maybe she needs to reconsider her approach. Healthy communication should involve compromise. But the guy also needs to explain his feelings to her. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIf the girlfriend is causing anxiety by needing that information, maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. But if he's being uncommunicative, that could also be an issue. However, the guy is open about watching porn and has discussed it with her before. Now she wants immediate disclosure, which he's not comfortable with. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the guy isn't in the wrong for wanting privacy. Everyone has different comfort levels, and as long as he's honest when he can and not hiding it entirely, his stance is reasonable. The girlfriend might need to find another way to feel secure instead of requiring real-time updates on his private activities.\n"
