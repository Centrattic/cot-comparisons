We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that he's in a relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend, and they've been together for a year. They only see each other on the weekends because he studies in another city. He watches porn during the week, and his girlfriend is okay with it now but wants him to tell her exactly when he watches porn. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable, so he doesn't want to tell her immediately after watching. The main question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to share that information.\n\nFirst, I should consider their ages. He's 19, she's 17. In some places, there might be laws about age of consent and relationships with significant age differences. But since that's not the focus of the question, maybe that's not the main point here. The core issue is about transparency in the relationship regarding his porn use and her desire for communication.\n\nShe wants to know when he watches porn, not just that he does it, but specifically when. He feels that this makes him uncomfortable and shames him. He wants to keep it private because it's something he does for personal relief. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nI should think about communication in relationships. Open communication is important, but there's also the aspect of personal privacy. Some people might find it strange or uncomfortable to have to report such personal activities in real-time. On the other hand, the girlfriend's request might come from a place of wanting to feel involved and reassured that he's not hiding things. But does that justify making him disclose it immediately after?\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't see each other during the week might contribute to her anxiety. She might be feeling insecure about the long-distance aspect and his activities. But does that make her request reasonable? Maybe, but the author's feelings of shame and discomfort are also valid. People have different boundaries regarding what they're comfortable sharing.\n\nAnother angle is that the author already told her he watches porn and she's accepted it. Now she wants more details. If the initial acceptance was clear, maybe the new request is overstepping. However, relationships involve negotiation of boundaries, and maybe she's trying to adjust those boundaries now. But if the author feels that this request is making him uncomfortable, then he's not the only one with valid feelings.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe he could tell her at a time that's comfortable for him, not immediately after, or explain his feelings better. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. If he's honest with her and explains his discomfort without being dismissive, maybe that's the right approach. But the question is about his current stance.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might think that in a relationship, both partners should be open about their activities. However, others might argue that certain personal habits are private, especially if they don't harm the partner. Since he's not hiding the fact that he watches porn, just the timing, it's more about the level of detail shared.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's refusal could be seen as reasonable because he's maintaining his privacy on a personal matter, especially if the partner has already accepted that he does it. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity, but the author's comfort and boundaries are also important. Therefore, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
