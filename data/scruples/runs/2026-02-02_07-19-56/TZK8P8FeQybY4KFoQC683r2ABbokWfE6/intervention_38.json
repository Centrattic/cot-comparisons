We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a couple, only see each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. The girlfriend wants him to tell her in the moment when he does it, but he feels uncomfortable and doesn't want to because it's something he does for personal relief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: she's asking for transparency to feel calm and secure. Maybe she feels insecure or like she's not trusted. She's younger too (17), which might make her more sensitive about such things. On the other hand, the author is 19 and might see watching porn as a private, stress-relief activity. He's not hiding it from her; he's just not sharing the exact timing. He's already told her he does it, and she's accepted it. Now she wants more information, but he finds it shameful and wants to move past it quickly.\n\nIs there a cultural or societal norm here? Some people might think that full transparency is important in a relationship, especially regarding things that could cause jealousy or insecurity. Others might argue that everyone has private habits, and as long as there's no harm or deceit, it's okay to keep certain things to oneself. The key here is that the author is not lying about watching porn; he's just not disclosing the specific times. The girlfriend is requesting more communication, but the author feels that it's intrusive.\n\nAlso, their age difference and the fact that they only see each other on weekends might mean that there's a lot of alone time during the week, which could contribute to her needing reassurance. However, the author's discomfort is valid. Feeling ashamed about a private activity that's not harming anyone else is a common issue. He might be worried about judgment or her negative reaction if he tells her in the moment.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could explain his feelings to her, showing that he respects her feelings but also needs privacy. Communication is key here. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to comply with her request. If he's honest about his reasoning and they can find a compromise, maybe neither is entirely wrong. However, if he refuses to communicate at all and it's causing her distress without effort to understand her perspective, that might be where he's at fault.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's for his own relief and he doesn't want to dwell on it. But if transparency is a mutual expectation in their relationship, then maybe he's not meeting her needs. However, if the act itself isn't a deal-breaker and he's already disclosed that he does it, then maybe the request for immediate disclosure is unreasonable. The line between privacy and transparency can be blurry. \n\nIn similar situations, people often suggest that both partners should express their needs and find a solution that works for both. The author might be in the wrong if he's dismissing her feelings and not trying to accommodate them. But if he's making an effort to explain his stance and she's not willing to meet him halfway, then maybe she's the one being unreasonable. Since the question is about the author's position, and he hasn't tried to communicate his reasons to her, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, if the request is reasonable and he's refusing without discussion, that could be where the issue lies.\n\nI think the main point is whether the author is being dishonest or violating trust. Since he's already told her he watches porn, and it's not a secret, the act of not telling her the exact time isn't necessarily deceitful. But if she feels that his refusal to share the timing is a form of hiding something, then that could be a problem. It's a balance between respecting his privacy and her need for reassurance. So, depending on how the situation is handled, both could have valid points. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he's not lying and it's a personal activity, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the relationship requires more communication for her peace of mind, then he might be. But since he's explaining his feelings here, seeking opinions, it shows he's trying to understand, which could mean he's not entirely wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not being deceptive and is sharing his feelings, even if there's room for better communication.\n"
