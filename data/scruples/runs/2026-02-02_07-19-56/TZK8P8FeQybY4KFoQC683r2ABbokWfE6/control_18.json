We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that the girlfriend wants him to inform her in real-time while he's watching, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing so. He wants it to be a private matter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: she wants to know because it calms her. That suggests she's trying to feel more secure in the relationship, maybe to reduce jealousy or anxiety. On the other hand, the author feels that this request is intrusive and makes him uncomfortable. He views watching porn as a private act that he doesn't want to share in the moment.\n\nRelationships often require compromise. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and trust, which are important. But the author has valid feelings about privacy and discomfort. The key here is communication. Is there a middle ground? For example, maybe he could tell her after the fact without having to do it in real-time. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nIn some cases, partners might expect openness about such matters, especially if it affects trust. However, the act of watching porn itself isn't inherently a betrayal if both parties agree. The author's discomfort with real-time disclosure might be reasonable if it adds unnecessary stress. The girlfriend's need for reassurance is understandable, but the method might not be the best approach.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the request is causing him significant distress and there's no mutual agreement on the terms, then maybe not. But if the girlfriend's request is a reasonable boundary that he's refusing without trying to find a compromise, then perhaps he's at fault. However, since he's already disclosing after the fact and she's accepted that, maybe his stance isn't entirely unreasonable. The answer might hinge on whether there's a compromise possible, but the question is whether he's in the wrong now. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend's request is new and the author's feelings are valid, the answer is likely B (he's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. Maybe there's a cultural or relational context where immediate disclosure is expected. However, without more info, his discomfort is a valid reason to not comply with that specific request. So, the answer is B.\n"
