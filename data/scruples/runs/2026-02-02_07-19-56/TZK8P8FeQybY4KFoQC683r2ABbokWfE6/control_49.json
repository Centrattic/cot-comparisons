We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation involves a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who are in a one-year relationship. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in another city during the week. He watches porn during the week, which she doesn't like but has accepted. Now she wants him to tell her while he's doing it, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful. He wants to keep it private as a quick relief and doesn't want to discuss it afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They are in a committed relationship, and communication is key. The girlfriend is seeking reassurance by wanting to know when he's watching porn, which suggests she might have trust issues or anxiety about his behavior. On the other hand, the author feels that this is a personal activity he wants to keep private, and the immediate disclosure makes him uncomfortable.\n\nThe age difference might also be a factor, but both are young adults. The key issue here is consent and mutual agreement on boundaries. The girlfriend is asking for something that the author is not comfortable with. Healthy relationships require both parties to respect each other's boundaries. If the author is not in the wrong, it's because he has a right to his privacy, especially regarding personal habits that don't harm others. However, if the girlfriend's request is about open communication and trust, then the author might be seen as not fully respecting her need for transparency.\n\nBut the problem is that the girlfriend has accepted that he watches porn, just wants to know when. The author is resisting because it makes him uncomfortable. It's a balance between respecting his privacy and her need for reassurance. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. If both can't find a middle ground, maybe the wrong isn't entirely on one side. However, since the author is in a committed relationship, perhaps some level of openness is expected. But if the act itself is not a deal-breaker for her, just the timing of disclosure, then his stance might be justified.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is being honest about his feelings and boundaries. He isn't hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's just not disclosing the exact timing. The girlfriend wants more information, but he feels it's intrusive. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong if he's being honest and the girlfriend is overstepping by demanding immediate disclosure. However, if the girlfriend's anxiety is valid and the author isn't making an effort to address her feelings, maybe he is at fault for not compromising.\n\nI think the key here is mutual respect. The author isn't violating any major boundary if he's not hiding the fact he watches porn. The girlfriend might need to adjust her expectations regarding the level of detail she wants. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
