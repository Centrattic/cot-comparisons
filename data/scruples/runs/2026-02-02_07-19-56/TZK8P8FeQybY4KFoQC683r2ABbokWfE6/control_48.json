We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend and girlfriend are in a 1-year relationship, meet only on weekends, and live apart during the week. The girl wants him to inform her right after he watches porn, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing so. He wants it to be a private matter for stress relief. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not agreeing to her request.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is important, but so is personal privacy. The girl's request might come from a place of insecurity or wanting reassurance. However, the boyfriend's feelings of shame and discomfort are valid. He's not hiding it from her; he's just not disclosing the exact timing. He's already accepted to not watch it in her presence, which might be what she wants. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have boundaries around certain topics. It's about mutual respect. If both parties can't find a middle ground, it's a conflict of needs. But the boyfriend isn't violating any agreement they might have had. He's just not meeting her specific request that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nLooking at similar situations, people often have different comfort levels. If the girl is okay with him watching porn as long as he informs her immediately, but he can't do that without feeling ashamed, it's a clash of needs. Neither is entirely wrong, but the boyfriend's stance is about his personal boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's respecting his own feelings and maintaining his privacy, as long as he's honest about it without causing harm. The key is whether there's mutual understanding and respect. Since he's not hiding it and she's accepted his porn use, the issue is the timing of disclosure. His discomfort is valid, so he's not necessarily wrong.\n"
