We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a young couple, 19 and 17, in a one-year relationship. They see each other only on weekends, and during the week, the guy is studying far away. He watches porn, which his girlfriend disapproves of but has accepted. Now she wants him to tell her in real-time when he's watching it, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful. He's wondering if he's unreasonable for not wanting to do that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is younger and maybe still in a formative stage of her views on relationships and intimacy. She's asking for transparency, which she says calms her. But the guy feels ashamed and wants to keep it private. The question is about whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nFrom a communication perspective, it's important that both partners feel heard and respected. The girlfriend's need for reassurance is valid, as she might feel insecure or worried about his behavior. However, the act of watching porn is a private matter for many people, and the expectation to disclose in real-time might be too much for the guy. His discomfort and the feeling of shame suggest that this request is causing him emotional distress.\n\nI should also consider cultural and psychological factors. Pornography is a sensitive topic in many relationships, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people might find it helpful to communicate openly about such matters, while others might prefer privacy. The key here is mutual respect and finding a compromise. The boyfriend isn't hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's already being transparent about it. The girlfriend is pushing for more immediate disclosure, which he's not comfortable with.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. Since the girlfriend is 17, there might be legal or maturity considerations, but the question is more about the relationship dynamics. However, the age difference isn't the main issue here. The main issue is about privacy vs. transparency.\n\nI should also think about the potential consequences. If he complies, he might feel even more ashamed and resentful, which could harm the relationship. If he doesn't comply, she might feel neglected or insecure. The ideal situation would be for them to find a middle ground where both feel respected. Maybe instead of real-time disclosure, he could check in with her later without the exact timing. But as it stands, the question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing.\n\nIn summary, while the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the author's discomfort and the nature of the request being in real-time during an act he does in private might make his stance understandable. It's a matter of balancing both partners' needs without forcing one to compromise their comfort level excessively. So, the answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong (B), but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
