We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the letter is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They don't see each other much except on weekends. He watches porn during the week, and his girlfriend wants him to tell her exactly when he does it, even while he's doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable and doesn't want to tell her immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're both teenagers, which can complicate matters because emotions and boundaries might still be developing. The girlfriend is 17, and he's 19. They're in a long-distance situation, which can lead to more jealousy or insecurity. She wants to know when he watches porn, but he's uncomfortable sharing that. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend is expressing her need for reassurance, which is understandable. She might feel insecure or anxious when he's not around. On the other hand, the author feels that this request makes him uncomfortable and ashamed. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nI should consider what's reasonable in a relationship. Trust and communication are important. If one partner wants more transparency, the other might feel it's an invasion of privacy. However, if the girlfriend's request is causing significant distress, it's a problem. But is the author at fault here? \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's age is a factor. She's 17, so maybe she's still figuring out how to handle such situations. But the author is older and in a position where he might need to be more understanding of her feelings. However, he also has the right to his own privacy, especially if it's a personal habit that doesn't harm her. \n\nThe author isn't lying about watching porn; he's just not disclosing the exact timing. The girlfriend wants real-time updates, which is more intrusive. So, the conflict is between her need for reassurance and his need for privacy. \n\nI think both sides have valid points. The author's discomfort isn't unreasonable, especially if it's something he does to relieve stress. But the girlfriend's request for communication is also a valid concern. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to tell immediately, but maybe the problem is the lack of a middle ground. Perhaps they need to find a compromise that respects both their feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not being deceptive but is setting a boundary, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's anxiety is due to a lack of trust, then the author might need to consider her feelings more. But again, it's a balance. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's asserting his privacy and the request seems excessive. However, it's a nuanced situation where both need to communicate better.\n"
