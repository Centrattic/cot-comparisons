We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they've been together a year, he's 19, she's 17. They only see each other on weekends. He watches porn during the week, and she wants to know when he does it in real-time. He's uncomfortable because it makes him feel ashamed and he wants to just get it over with.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is 17, which is under 18 in many places, so there might be legal or maturity factors. But the main issue is about communication and boundaries. The girl wants transparency to feel calm, which is understandable. But the author feels that it's a private matter and that sharing it in real-time is too much.\n\nI should think about consent and mutual respect. If both partners are okay with the boundaries, then it's about their agreement. However, since she's 17, maybe there's an imbalance in the relationship dynamics. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nHe's not sharing something she wants to know, which is about honesty. But he's also within his right to keep certain things private. The key here is whether his refusal is unreasonable. Some might argue that in a relationship, full honesty is important, but others might say everyone has privacy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's 17 might mean she's more anxious or seeking reassurance, which he should consider. However, the author's discomfort is valid too. So it's a balance between her need for reassurance and his need for privacy. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether there's mutual agreement. If they've discussed it and she still insists, maybe the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. But if he agreed to tell her and then changed his mind, that's different. Based on the description, he's not agreeing to her request, which she finds comforting. But he feels it's shame-inducing. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he can't explain his feelings without making her feel dismissed, that's a problem. But if he's honest about his reasons and they find a compromise, that's better than one side feeling wrong. Given the options, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong, because privacy is a valid concern, and she needs to respect his boundaries too.\n"
