We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's in a relationship with his girlfriend, and they only see each other on weekends. He's 19, she's 17, and they've been together for a year. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it now but wants him to tell her exactly when he does it, even while he's doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable about it because he wants to just get it out of his mind and do it alone for a quick release.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend wants transparency to feel at ease, which is a common need in relationships. Communication is key, so her asking for that makes sense. But the author is uncomfortable with the idea of telling her in real-time. He might feel that his privacy is being invaded, or that it's something personal he doesn't want to discuss.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, honesty is important. If she's requesting this level of communication because it helps her feel secure, then maybe the author should be more accommodating. However, there's also the aspect of personal privacy. Everyone has private habits, and porn is a common topic where people might feel embarrassed. The author's discomfort could be valid if he feels it's a personal matter that doesn't need to be discussed in real-time.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend's request might be about control or insecurity. If she's making him disclose his actions in a way that's intrusive, it might be a sign that she's not respecting his boundaries. But if it's just about her needing reassurance, then the author might need to find a middle ground, like discussing it after the fact without the pressure of real-time communication.\n\nThe key factors are mutual respect and boundaries. If the author is not violating any agreements they've already made, and if his actions aren't causing her harm beyond her emotional discomfort, then he might not be in the wrong. However, if transparency is a mutual expectation they've agreed upon, then not complying could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut in this case, the author mentions that she's grown to accept it, so maybe the initial agreement was about not having to talk about it. Now she's changing the terms, which could be problematic. The author's discomfort is valid if the new request is unreasonable. So, the balance here is between her need for communication and his right to privacy. \n\nIn relationships, negotiation is essential. The author might need to explain his feelings of shame and suggest alternative ways she can get reassurance without real-time disclosure. If he's honest about his feelings and they can find a compromise, that's the ideal solution. But in terms of whether he's in the wrong, if the new request was not part of their established boundaries, he might not be at fault for maintaining his privacy, especially if it's causing him emotional distress.\n"
