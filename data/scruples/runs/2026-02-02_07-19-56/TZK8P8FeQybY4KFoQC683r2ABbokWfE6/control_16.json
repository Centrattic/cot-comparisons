We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (a guy in a relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately when he watches porn. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their situation. They've been together a year, see each other only on weekends, and he studies in a different city. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it but wants him to tell her in the moment. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing that.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's request is about her feeling calmer knowing, but the guy feels it's embarrassing. Now, the age here is a factor\u2014she's 17, which is under 18 in many places, but the legal age for relationships can vary, and since they're both minors, maybe it's allowed, but that's a legal detail. But the question isn't about legality, it's about whether he's wrong in this specific situation.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, when one partner has a request regarding another's behavior, it's important to address it. However, the guy's discomfort is valid. There's a balance between respecting her feelings and his own boundaries. If he's willing to communicate after the fact or discuss it in a way that makes both comfortable, that's good. But if he refuses any form of communication, that could be an issue. However, she's asking for immediate disclosure, which he finds shameful. \n\nHe might not be in the wrong if he's honest about his feelings and they find a middle ground. If he's completely closed off and refuses to communicate at all, that's different. But here, he's expressing discomfort and seeking advice on how to explain his feelings. So he's trying to find a solution, not being dismissive. \n\nAlso, considering the age difference and their living arrangements, they're both young and navigating adult relationships. It's possible that both are learning how to communicate effectively. The key here is whether he's being disrespectful. Since he's not hiding it entirely (he's already told her he watches porn, and she's accepted it to some extent), the issue is the timing of disclosure. He's not being dishonest, just choosing when to share the information. \n\nIn many relationships, partners negotiate boundaries around such sensitive topics. His discomfort with immediate disclosure might be reasonable if it's causing him distress. However, her request is about her emotional needs. The answer likely depends on whether they can find a compromise. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that both partners have valid feelings, it's a matter of mutual understanding. If he's open to discussing his feelings and finding a solution, he's not necessarily wrong. If he's being inflexible without trying to understand her perspective, that's different. The original post shows he's trying to understand his own feelings and seek advice, so he's not in the wrong for being honest about his discomfort. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
