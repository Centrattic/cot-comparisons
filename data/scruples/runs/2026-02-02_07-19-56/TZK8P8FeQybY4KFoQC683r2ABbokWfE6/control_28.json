We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The author is 19M, girlfriend is 17F, in a 1-year relationship. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in another city. She's okay with him watching porn but wants him to tell her immediately when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable, wants to just forget about it.\n\nHmm, so first, the age thing. She's 17, which is under 18 in many places. Wait, but they've been together a year. Maybe that's not directly relevant here, but maybe there's some context about their maturity levels. However, the main issue is about communication and boundaries around watching porn.\n\nShe wants to know in the moment or right after. He feels that's uncomfortable. He wants to keep it private because it's for stress relief. The key points here are consent and communication. Both partners need to agree on what's acceptable. If she's asking for transparency, but he's uncomfortable, there's a conflict.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, if the agreement was that she's accepted he watches porn, but now she's changing the terms without considering his feelings. If he didn't agree to this new condition, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the new condition is part of their ongoing discussions, he needs to communicate his feelings. It's about mutual respect. He has the right to privacy, especially if it's a personal habit that doesn't harm her. But she has a right to feel secure. However, the immediate disclosure might be too much for him. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because he's not wrong for not wanting to disclose in the moment. It's about finding a middle ground where both feel respected. But if the new condition was mutually agreed upon before, then maybe he is. But according to his description, she's newly introduced this requirement without considering his discomfort. So he's not in the wrong for not complying. He should negotiate with her, explain his feelings, and perhaps agree on a time when he can talk about it without pressure. So B.\n"
