We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a 19-year-old guy, is in a one-year relationship with his 17-year-old girlfriend. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in another city. He watches porn during the week, and his girlfriend is okay with it but wants to know exactly when he does it while he's doing it. He's uncomfortable and doesn't want to tell her in real time because it makes him feel ashamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. The girlfriend isn't asking to watch him do it, just to know when he's watching porn. The author is concerned about privacy. But the girlfriend's request is about communication and reassurance. However, the key points are consent, mutual respect, and understanding each other's boundaries.\n\nThe author's argument is that he wants privacy and that it's a personal, private act. On the other hand, the girlfriend's request is to be informed in real time, which might be her way of feeling involved or trusting. But asking someone to inform you immediately after they engage in a private act might be a bit much. It's possible that the girlfriend's need for reassurance is valid, but the method might not be. The author's discomfort is understandable because sharing such a personal act in real time could be intrusive.\n\nAlso, considering their age difference, both are minors (the girlfriend is 17), but the legal age for consent varies by jurisdiction. However, the question isn't about legality but about right and wrong in the context of their relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of boundaries. If the author is willing to tell her after the fact but not in real time, that's a middle ground. The girlfriend's request is more demanding. The author's discomfort is valid because people often feel embarrassed about pornography use. The key here is whether the girlfriend's request is reasonable. If she's not asking to monitor or control it, just to know when it happens, maybe there's a way to communicate without being ashamed. However, if the act is a private one, expecting someone to announce it as they do it might be crossing into being overbearing.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's refusal isn't about lying but about setting a boundary. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or a need for validation. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because he's maintaining his privacy, which is a reasonable boundary. However, the girlfriend's feelings are also important. If the author is willing to be honest about his behavior, even if not in real-time, that's a compromise. But forcing someone to announce their private actions might be too much.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the request is reasonable. Since the author is not lying but choosing not to share in a specific way that makes him uncomfortable, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend might need to adjust her request to respect his privacy. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
