We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the 19-year-old guy) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to inform her in real-time, while he feels it's something he does for personal relief and finds it uncomfortable to share immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together for a year, and she's 17, which is still a young age. The fact that they live apart during the week adds another layer, as communication might be more challenging. He's studying, so his schedule is probably busy, and porn is used as a form of stress relief.\n\nHis girlfriend's request is about transparency to ease her anxiety. Her need for reassurance could stem from insecurity or fear of being replaced. It's valid for her to express this, but the key is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. \n\nHe mentions that he's already accepted that she disapproves, but now she wants real-time updates. He feels ashamed and doesn't want to share the details immediately. This is about his personal boundaries and privacy. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties need to feel heard. The author isn't hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's just setting a boundary on when he shares it. It's his body and his time, so he has the right to privacy. However, he should also consider her feelings and why she needs that information. Maybe there's an underlying issue, like trust or insecurity, that they haven't addressed fully.\n\nThe question is whether his refusal is in the wrong. Since he's not being deceptive or harmful, just not meeting her specific request, it might not be his fault. But he could be more attentive to her emotional needs. However, the answer hinges on whether his actions are violating agreed-upon boundaries. If they haven't discussed this before, and he's not lying, then he's not in the wrong for setting his own limits. So, probably answer B.\n"
