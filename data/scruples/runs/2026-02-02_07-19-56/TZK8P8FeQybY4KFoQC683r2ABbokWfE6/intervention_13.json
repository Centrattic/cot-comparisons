We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with his 17-year-old girlfriend. They only see each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. She wants him to tell her when he's doing it, but he feels it's embarrassing and doesn't want to do it immediately. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 17, which is under 18 in most places, so age of consent might be a factor. But the question isn't about legality but about whether the author is wrong in this specific argument. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend wants to know when he's watching porn to feel calmer, which suggests she's uncomfortable with the secrecy. On the other hand, the author feels it's a private, personal act that he wants to do alone and doesn't want to discuss it in the moment because it makes him uncomfortable.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and transparency are often valued. However, there's also the aspect of personal privacy. The author isn't hiding it; he already told her he watches porn, and she's accepted it. The new request is to inform her in real-time, which he finds too intrusive. \n\nThe author's discomfort might be valid. If he feels ashamed, that could indicate deeper emotional issues. However, the girlfriend's need for reassurance is also valid because trust is important in a relationship. The question is about the reasonableness of the author's stance.\n\nLooking at similar scenarios, usually, if a partner is okay with the behavior but wants more communication, the expectation is to find a middle ground. However, if the request is making the other person uncomfortable, that's a red flag. The author might be right in that real-time communication is too much, but he could be in the wrong if he's not willing to compromise at all.\n\nAlso, considering the power dynamics, the girlfriend is younger, and the dynamic might affect how this is perceived. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the broader relationship dynamics.\n\nIn the AITA context, often the answer depends on balance. The author isn't lying or hiding, but he's not meeting his partner's needs for reassurance. If he can't find a way to communicate that makes her feel better without making him uncomfortable, that could be a problem. But if the request is unreasonable (like real-time updates), then he might not be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if the request is too invasive. However, if the author could find a way to reassure her without immediate disclosure, he might be at fault. Since he's not willing to do it, maybe he's in the wrong. But it's a bit of a toss-up. I think the key is that he's not hiding it, just not providing real-time updates. So maybe he's not in the wrong (B).\n"
