We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy and his girlfriend have been in a relationship for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. His girlfriend wants him to tell her exactly when he does it, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable, so he doesn't want to immediately after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl is asking for communication to feel reassured, which is a valid need in a relationship. Open communication is important for trust. However, the guy feels that this request makes him uncomfortable and shames him. He wants to keep this part of his life private, which might be a personal boundary he's trying to maintain.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the couple has an agreement about porn and this request is part of that agreement, then not following through could be a breach. On the other hand, if the request is new and he hasn't agreed to it, maybe he's not obligated to comply. However, ignoring his partner's feelings of needing reassurance might be harmful to the relationship. The key here is mutual respect and negotiation. If he can't communicate his reasons to her and she still feels uncomfortable, it might create tension. But if he's honest about his feelings and they can find a compromise, that's a better path. The answer might depend on how they handle the situation rather than a clear right or wrong. However, since the girl's request is about communication and he's refusing to provide that, some might see it as a lack of transparency. But others might see his right to privacy. So, the answer isn't straightforward. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides again. If the author refuses to meet halfway or communicate, he's in the wrong. If he's trying to find a middle ground, maybe not. In this case, the author hasn't mentioned trying to find a compromise, so maybe he's in the wrong. But maybe not because he has his own feelings to consider. Hmm. Maybe the answer is A (yes) because not communicating can hurt the relationship, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, B (no), because his privacy and comfort matter too. I need to check if there's a standard here. In relationships, being honest about such things is often advised. However, the timing and method of disclosure can vary. The girl's request is specific to when he watches it. If he's honest after the fact, maybe that's not enough for her. But if he's honest about his feelings, maybe they can find another way. Since he's not willing to meet her request, he might be in the wrong. So maybe A.\n"
