We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the described situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They see each other only on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. The girlfriend wants him to tell her exactly when he's watching porn, while he feels it's something he does in private and doesn't want to share. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when it comes to things that can cause discomfort or insecurity. The girlfriend is asking for transparency because it \"calms her,\" which suggests she might feel anxious about his porn use. Maybe she's concerned about his fidelity, or perhaps she feels left out. It's important to recognize that her request is about her emotional needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels ashamed and uncomfortable sharing the exact times he watches porn. He sees it as a private activity for stress relief. It's possible he feels that being transparent would invade his privacy and make him feel exposed. So, there's a conflict between her need for reassurance and his need for privacy.\n\nBut wait, age is a factor here. The girlfriend is 17, which is below the legal age of adulthood in many places. The relationship might be in a gray area legally, but the question isn't about the legality. Still, it's worth noting that the girlfriend might not have the emotional maturity to handle such a situation, or vice versa.\n\nThe author's request is about whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, both partners have the right to privacy and the right to have their feelings respected. However, when one partner's actions affect the other's emotional well-being, finding a middle ground is necessary. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, he's not hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's just not disclosing the exact times. The girlfriend's request is specific and might stem from insecurity. If the author is already being honest about his porn use, then not sharing the exact times might not be inconsiderate. However, if this lack of transparency is causing her distress, then maybe he should consider her feelings more. \n\nBut the author's discomfort is valid too. It's natural to feel that some activities should remain private. However, in a relationship, especially a trusting one, there's a balance. The question is whether his refusal to share the exact times is unreasonable. \n\nLooking at similar situations, some people might expect their partner to be honest about their actions but not necessarily every detail. The key is mutual respect. If the author is willing to communicate about his porn use in general, then his stance isn't entirely unreasonable. But if the girlfriend's anxiety is significant, maybe he could find a way to reassure her without compromising his privacy. For example, telling her a general time frame without specifics. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author is being dishonest or just selective about the details. If he's honest about his behavior but not the exact times, he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's request is a legitimate emotional need that he's dismissing without effort to address, then he might be contributing to the problem. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's not hiding the fact he watches porn. He's just choosing not to share every detail, which is a personal boundary. The girlfriend's request is valid in her need for reassurance, but the author's discomfort is also valid. It's a communication issue rather than a clear case of one being wrong.\n"
