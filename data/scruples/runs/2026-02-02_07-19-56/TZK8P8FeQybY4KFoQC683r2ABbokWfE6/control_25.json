      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a year-long relationship. They only see each other on weekends, and the guy studies in another city. He watches porn during the week. The girlfriend is okay with the fact that he does it, but she wants him to tell her in the moment when he's doing it. He feels uncomfortable with that and doesn't want to. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nHmm. So, in relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend is expressing her need for reassurance. She says it calms her to know when he watches porn. But the guy feels ashamed and wants privacy. He sees it as a personal thing he does alone for stress relief. \n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and making her feel secure. But the guy's discomfort is about privacy and embarrassment. Both have valid points. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend is not asking for him to stop, just to inform her when he does it. However, he's not in the wrong if he has a legitimate reason to decline. But maybe there's a middle ground. Like, he could tell her after the fact if he feels uncomfortable doing it in the moment. That way, he shares the information without the immediate pressure.\n\nBut the way the question is framed, it's a yes or no. The options are A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong). The key here is mutual respect and understanding. If the girlfriend's request is causing him significant discomfort, maybe she needs to reconsider. However, if communication is important for their relationship, finding a compromise is necessary. But the question is if he's in the wrong. Since both have valid perspectives, but he's not violating any boundaries by not agreeing to her request, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: if they have agreed on certain terms already, like she's accepted him watching porn, then her new condition might be a boundary he doesn't have to meet. The problem is she's now adding a new condition that makes him uncomfortable. So he's not wrong for not agreeing. Therefore, answer B.\n"
