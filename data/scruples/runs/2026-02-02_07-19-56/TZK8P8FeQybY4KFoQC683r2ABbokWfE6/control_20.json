We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not telling his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that the girlfriend wants him to tell her while he's doing it to calm her down, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. They're 19 and 17, and they've been together a year. He's studying in another city, so they only see each other on weekends. That physical separation might affect their communication. The girlfriend has accepted that he watches porn, but now wants him to inform her in real-time. The author is uncomfortable with this because it makes him feel ashamed and he wants to keep it private.\n\nI should think about boundaries and mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's request is about transparency, which is understandable if she feels anxious. But the author's request for privacy is also valid because it's a personal activity. The key here is whether one person's needs are overriding the other's without compromise.\n\nThe girlfriend's wanting to know might stem from insecurity or a need for reassurance. However, the author has a right to privacy regarding his personal habits, especially if they aren't harmful. It's about finding a middle ground. If the author is willing to tell her after the fact but not in real-time, maybe that's a compromise. The question is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable. Since he's explaining his feelings and the request isn't about stopping the behavior but timing of disclosure, he's not in the wrong. He's setting a boundary, which is okay as long as it's communicated and respected. The answer would be B.\n"
