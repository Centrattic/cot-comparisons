We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. So, the situation is that they're in a one-year relationship. He's 19, she's 17. They see each other only on weekends, and he studies in another city. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it now but wants him to inform her while he's doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable about it and just wants to move on after. He's wondering if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in relationships. Communication is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend wants transparency, which is understandable if she's feeling insecure or wants to be involved in all aspects of his life. However, the act of watching porn is a private, personal activity that many people prefer to keep to themselves. It's a form of self-pleasure, and sharing that exact moment might be intrusive for him.\n\nOn the other hand, her request could stem from a need for trust and reassurance. If she's uncomfortable with the secrecy, she might feel like he's hiding something. But in this case, he's already told her he watches porn, and she's accepted it. Now she wants more information than he's willing to give. That might be crossing into his personal space.\n\nAlso, considering their age difference and the fact that they're young, they might still be figuring out what's acceptable in their relationship. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't lying or keeping it a secret; he's just not disclosing the exact timing. He's being honest but wants to maintain some privacy. She's asking for more than he's comfortable giving, which could be a matter of personal boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: if the request was about general openness, like discussing it after the fact, that might be different. But doing it in real-time could interfere with his privacy and comfort. It's possible she's seeking control or reassurance in a way that's not necessary. It's a balance between her emotional needs and his personal space.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's honest about his porn use and she's accepted that, then not sharing the exact timing might not be wrong. It's about respecting each other's boundaries. If she can handle knowing he watches porn without needing real-time updates, then his stance is reasonable. But if she feels her needs aren't met, that's a separate issue. The question is about the author's right to keep that part private. In many relationships, this is a common point of discussion where both partners need to find a middle ground. Since he's not hiding the fact he watches porn, just the timing, it seems like he's not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
