We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's think through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. He's 19, she's 17, and they've been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and he's in another city for school. She wants him to tell her in the moment he's watching porn, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend is expressing her need for reassurance, which is valid. But the author is also sharing his feelings about the situation. He feels ashamed and wants privacy. The question is whether his refusal to comply with her request is unreasonable.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the girlfriend's request for transparency might stem from insecurity or trust issues. She wants to feel involved and maybe reduce her anxiety. On the other hand, the author has a right to privacy and autonomy over his personal habits, especially if they're not harmful. Watching porn isn't inherently wrong, and the act of informing her in real-time adds an extra layer of discomfort that might not be necessary.\n\nThe author isn't hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's just not disclosing the exact timing. He's already agreed she knows he does it, which is a middle ground. The girlfriend's need for more information could be reasonable, but it's pushing the author beyond his comfort zone. It's a balance between her need for reassurance and his need for privacy.\n\nAlso, considering their age and relationship duration, they're still learning each other's boundaries. It's possible that the girlfriend's request is a bit extreme given the circumstances. The author's discomfort is a valid emotion, and forcing him to comply might create more issues. They might need to find a compromise, like setting a time to discuss it later without the immediate pressure.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's respecting his own boundaries while being honest about his habits. The issue is about differing needs in the relationship rather than one party being wrong.\n"
