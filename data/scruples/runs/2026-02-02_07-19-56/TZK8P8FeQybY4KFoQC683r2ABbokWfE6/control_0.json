We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy and his girlfriend have a disagreement about him watching porn. She wants him to tell her exactly when he does it, while he feels ashamed and doesn't want to. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants transparency for her peace of mind. That's understandable; she might feel insecure or worried about his actions. On the other hand, the guy feels uncomfortable and wants to keep this personal activity private. It's not uncommon for people to have private habits they don't want to share, especially if it makes them feel vulnerable.\n\nNow, considering their relationship dynamics, they've been together a year and she's accepted that he watches porn, even if she dislikes it. The new issue is the immediate disclosure. The author's reasoning is that it shames him and he wants to move on from it. That seems like a valid personal boundary. However, the girlfriend's request is about communication. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is crucial. But it's also important to respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend's request is making the guy uncomfortable to the point of feeling shamed, that's a red flag. It might indicate control or insecurity on her part. But if she's genuinely trying to feel more at ease, maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to comply.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. If the girlfriend is asking for something that makes him feel violated or ashamed, and there's no mutual agreement, then perhaps the author isn't wrong. Relationships require compromise, but both parties need to respect each other's limits. Since the author is not hiding the fact that he watches porn, just the exact timing, and he's already sharing it with her, maybe the issue is about the method of disclosure. If she can't respect his privacy in the act, that could be an issue. \n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author might need to explain his feelings better. However, based on the information given, the author's discomfort is valid. So the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
