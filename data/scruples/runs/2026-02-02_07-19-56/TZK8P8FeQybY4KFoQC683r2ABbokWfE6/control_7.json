      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend, having been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in another city during the week. He watches porn, which she's not happy about but has accepted. Now, she wants him to tell her when he does it, while doing it, to calm her nerves. He's uncomfortable with that, feels ashamed, and wants to just get it out of his mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is 17 and he's 19. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so I should check if that's a red flag. If the relationship is legal, but maybe there's a power imbalance because she's younger and might feel pressured. However, the main issue here is about privacy versus transparency.\n\nHe wants to keep it private because it's something personal and he feels ashamed. She wants reassurance by knowing in real-time. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. From a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. If he's already watching porn, even if she's accepted it, her need for immediate disclosure might stem from insecurity or fear of being left out. But he's not willing to comply because it's a personal activity he wants to keep separate.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. Everyone has different comfort levels. If the agreement was that he wouldn't tell her when he watches, and she's now changing the terms without consensus, that could be an issue. However, if he's already agreed to tell her after the fact, but she wants real-time updates, maybe he's not in the wrong for not agreeing to a more intrusive level. Alternatively, if he's not agreed to any disclosure previously, and she's now asking for more than before, he's within his rights to set a boundary.\n\nAnother angle: The shame he feels might indicate that he's conflicted about his porn use, which could be a deeper issue. But the question is about the right to privacy. If she's okay with him watching it as long as he's honest, but now wants more transparency, it's about mutual respect and compromise. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, maybe he's being unreasonable. But if his comfort level is non-negotiable, he's not in the wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the age difference. At 17, she might be more emotionally dependent, but that doesn't mean her feelings are invalid. However, the fact that he's in a sexual activity and using porn might be complicated given her age, even if it's legal. But the question is specifically about disclosure.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might find it reasonable to respect someone's privacy in such matters, while others might prioritize the partner's emotional needs. It's a balance between individual rights and relationship dynamics.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there was prior agreement. If the girlfriend's request is new and he's not on board, he's not wrong to set a boundary. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong. However, if the problem is that he's not being transparent at all, maybe there's an issue. But given that she's accepted it before, just wants more info, he's within his rights to say no.\n"
