We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the guy is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. They've been together a year, only see each other on weekends. He studies in another city. She's okay with him watching porn but wants him to tell her when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing it immediately after because he wants to forget about it quickly.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend wants to know to feel calm, which suggests she's trying to be open and maybe deal with her feelings. The guy feels it's a private thing, something he does for himself and wants to keep separate. \n\nBut in a healthy relationship, both partners should feel comfortable discussing their needs. However, the guy's request for privacy isn't unreasonable. Watching porn is a common activity, and the act of sharing the exact time might not be necessary if both are already in agreement that it's okay. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or wanting to be involved in all aspects of his life, but if it's causing him discomfort, that's a problem too.\n\nThe guy isn't hiding it; he's already sharing that he watches porn. His refusal to tell her immediately after is about his personal boundaries. It's important both partners respect each other's limits. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But there's a balance. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like a general time frame or reassurance without the exact moment. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girl's need for communication is important for trust, not complying could cause issues. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since he's not lying or hiding, just setting boundaries, he's probably not wrong. Answer B.\n"
