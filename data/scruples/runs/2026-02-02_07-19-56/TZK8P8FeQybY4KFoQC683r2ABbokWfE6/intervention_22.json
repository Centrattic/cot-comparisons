We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the guy watches porn and the girlfriend wants him to tell her exactly when he does it. He doesn't want to because it makes him uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy is 19, and his girlfriend is 17, which is still a minor in many places. The fact that they have a long-distance situation and only see each other on weekends adds some context. The girl wants to know when he watches porn because it calms her. She's not asking for approval, just communication. But he's ashamed and doesn't want to share that moment. \n\nNow, communication is key in relationships. If she's expressing a need for transparency to feel secure, maybe he should at least acknowledge her feelings. But on the other hand, everyone has private moments, and watching porn is a common behavior. The discomfort he feels is valid too. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's request might stem from a place of insecurity. She might fear he's hiding something or being deceptive. If he's not being dishonest but just not sharing that specific detail, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, he could tell her he watches it on certain days without giving exact times, or reassure her that he's not hiding anything. \n\nBut the core issue is whether he's wrong for not complying. If the request is about knowing when he does it while doing it, that could be invasive. Privacy is important. However, if the girl feels her need for communication is not being met, there's a problem. The guy's discomfort is also valid, as sharing such a private act might be embarrassing. \n\nI think it's a balance. The guy isn't in the wrong for not wanting to tell her in the moment, but maybe he should find a way to address her feelings without full disclosure. The answer depends on mutual respect and compromise. Since the user says the author is in the wrong, but I see valid points from both sides, I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because the request might be too specific and intruding on his privacy. However, there's room for discussion on how to handle her need for reassurance without violating his privacy.\n"
