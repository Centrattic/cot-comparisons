We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a couple for a year, he's 19, she's 17, they see each other only on weekends. He watches porn during the week, and now she wants him to tell her when he does it, so it calms her. He's uncomfortable because it shames him and he wants to just get it out of his mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girl's request is about feeling reassured, which is valid. Open communication in relationships is important. But the guy feels that this request makes him uncomfortable and ashamed. He views it as something he does alone for stress relief. \n\nThe age part might be relevant. She's 17, which is under 18 in many places. However, the question isn't about legality but about the ethics of the situation. The key issue is consent and mutual respect. The girl wants to know, the guy doesn't want to share. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they could find a compromise. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girl's request is causing him distress, then it's a problem. However, if he's agreed to some level of openness before, maybe he's not meeting her needs. \n\nBut the situation is that she wants him to tell her in the moment, which he's not comfortable with. He's been accepted for watching porn, but now she wants more transparency. It's a communication issue. The author's discomfort might be valid, but so is her need for reassurance. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. If he's not willing to meet her needs, it's a conflict. But if his refusal is based on his own discomfort, maybe he's being unreasonable. However, the act of watching porn is a personal choice, and being forced to disclose it in real-time might infringe on his privacy. \n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? It's a balance. He isn't violating any prior agreement since she accepted him watching porn. But now she's asking for something new that he's uncomfortable with. If he can't meet her needs without feeling ashamed, maybe they need to talk again. Alternatively, his stance is about personal privacy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear yes or no. But since the options are A or B, I have to pick. If the author's refusal is causing distress to the partner, maybe he's in the wrong. However, if he's honest about his discomfort and they can find another solution, maybe not. Since he hasn't agreed, but she's asking for something new, and he's not willing, perhaps he's not in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
