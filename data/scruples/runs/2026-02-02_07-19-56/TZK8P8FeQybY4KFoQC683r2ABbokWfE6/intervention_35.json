We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they are in a one-year relationship, and they only see each other on weekends. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it now but wants him to tell her when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend wants transparency to feel calmer, which is understandable. Open communication is important in relationships. However, the author feels it's a private matter and wants to keep it to himself for his mental state. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could tell her after the fact without being intrusive. But the key here is mutual respect. If she's asking for something that makes him uncomfortable, maybe she's overstepping. On the flip side, if he's willing to discuss it after, but not during, maybe that's a compromise. But does her request violate his privacy?\n\nAlso, the age factor: 19 and 17. Depending on the jurisdiction, the legal age of consent might be a factor, but since they're in a relationship, that's probably not the main issue here. \n\nThe author's discomfort is valid. Watching porn is a personal habit, and feeling the need to inform someone in real-time could add stress. However, in a relationship, some level of openness is expected. The problem is whether her request is reasonable. If she's okay with him watching it but just wants to know the timing, maybe it's about trust. If he can't find a way to make her feel secure without violating his own comfort, there might be a deeper issue. \n\nThe answer probably depends on whether the author is willing to meet halfway. If he's completely refusing to communicate, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if he's open to talking about it after the fact, then it's a matter of negotiation. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the author might not be entirely wrong if he's maintaining that the act itself isn't the issue, just the timing of disclosure. But if she's asking for something that affects her emotional well-being, and he's unwilling to accommodate even a bit, that could be where he's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if he's already informed her that he watches porn and she's accepted it, maybe the real issue is her needing reassurance in a way that he's not comfortable providing. In that case, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. But it's a delicate balance between respecting each other's needs.\n"
