      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who have been in a relationship for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in another city during the week. The main issue is about him watching porn and her wanting him to tell her exactly when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable about it and doesn't want to inform her immediately after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl wants transparency because it makes her feel secure. It's understandable that she's concerned, maybe even insecure or worried about his fidelity, even though he's watching porn, which isn't necessarily cheating. But her request is specific: he should tell her exactly when he does it, right then. That's a bit unusual. Most people might prefer to know in general, but not necessarily the exact time.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy feels that doing so would make him uncomfortable and ashamed. He views it as something personal and private, which he wants to keep to himself for stress relief. His reasoning is that he just wants to get it out of his mind afterward. The key here is about consent and mutual understanding in the relationship. \n\nNow, considering the ages: both are teenagers, and relationships can be more volatile or influenced by emotional immaturity. The girl is 17, which is still young, and her need for reassurance might stem from insecurity rather than mature communication. But that's not an excuse; communication is important regardless of age.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to comply with her request. The answer depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If they have an agreement where he tells her he watches porn in general but not the exact times, and now she's changing the rules, that might be a problem. However, if she's now asking for something that makes him uncomfortable, it's a boundary issue. \n\nBut is it wrong to set boundaries? If the girl is making him do something that causes him distress, that could be problematic. However, the other aspect is transparency in a relationship. If he's being honest about watching porn in general, but not the exact times, maybe she's feeling left out or not trusted. It's a balance between honesty and privacy.\n\nIn many relationships, partners don't have to disclose every detail of their personal habits unless it affects the other person. Since watching porn is a common behavior, and unless it's causing harm, the need to know exact times might be excessive. Therefore, the author's discomfort is valid. However, if the girl feels that not knowing specific times is causing her anxiety, there's a responsibility to address that. \n\nBut the crux is whether not informing her immediately makes him wrong. If he's already being honest about watching porn, the exact time might be a personal choice. So, the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because maintaining personal boundaries is important, and her request is unreasonable if it causes him distress without a valid reason. However, there's a need for mutual respect and communication. If he's not forthcoming at all, that's different. But in this case, he's already sharing that he watches porn, just not the exact time. So, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
