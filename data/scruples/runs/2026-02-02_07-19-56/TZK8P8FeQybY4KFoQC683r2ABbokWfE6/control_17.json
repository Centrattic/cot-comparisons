We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is a 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in a different city. He watches porn during the week, which she dislikes but has accepted. Now she wants him to tell her when he's doing it, even while he's doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable, and just wants to do it privately. He's asking if he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age aspect. She's 17, which is under 18 in most places, so the relationship might have some legal or maturity-related issues. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong regarding the porn issue. \n\nIn terms of communication, transparency is important in relationships. She's asking him to be more open about his porn use, which she finds comforting. But he feels it's something private and doesn't want to share the exact timing. \n\nI should think about boundaries and mutual respect. If she's uncomfortable with him watching porn, maybe there's an underlying issue about their communication or trust. However, he's already told her he does it and she's accepted that. Now she wants real-time notification, which he finds intrusive. \n\nSome people might argue that he should comply because it reduces her anxiety, but others might say that his privacy and personal habits should be respected. The key here is whether there's a mutual agreement that's respectful to both. \n\nHe mentions that he does it for \"quick relief, no strings attached,\" which might indicate it's a personal habit he doesn't feel needs to be shared in detail. If she's agreed not to ask for specifics, then maybe she's overstepping now. \n\nAlso, considering the power dynamic, since he's older and in a different location, but she's still 17, which might affect how the situation is viewed. However, the main question is about the specific issue of disclosure. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable and if there's a healthy way to address her concerns without violating his boundaries. The author's discomfort with sharing the exact times could be valid, especially if it's causing him shame. \n\nSo, the possible answer is B (No), because his desire for privacy in this personal activity might be reasonable, and her request could be seen as excessive, especially if he's already been open about his habits. However, there's also a need for him to explain his feelings to her to find a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, so if he's not violating any prior agreement, he might not be.\n"
