She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to inform her while he's doing it, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable, preferring to keep it private for his own reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a year, see each other only on weekends, and live apart during the week. The girlfriend has accepted that he watches porn but now wants more transparency. The key issue here is communication and boundaries. Both partners have valid feelings here: the girlfriend feels anxious without knowing, and the author feels embarrassed and wants privacy.\n\nOpen communication is crucial in relationships. The girlfriend's request might stem from a need for reassurance, especially if she's concerned about his habits or potential issues. However, the author's discomfort is also valid. Watching porn is a personal activity, and expecting someone to share that moment in real-time could be seen as intrusive. It's about mutual respect for each other's needs.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend has made this a deal-breaker and the author refuses to comply, it could lead to conflict. But if the author has clearly communicated his reasons and they're both trying to find a middle ground, then it's a negotiation. The author isn't hiding it completely\u2014he's just not telling her in real-time. He shares after the fact, which the girlfriend might not find sufficient. However, the act of informing her post-hoc might not be enough for her, but the author's discomfort needs to be respected as well.\n\nThe key here is whether there's a compromise. The author could consider sharing some information to ease her anxiety without having to do it in real-time. For example, letting her know when he watches it later in the day or setting some boundaries that work for both. But the author's stance is about his personal privacy and comfort. If the girlfriend is pressuring him beyond his comfort zone, that might be an issue.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might argue that transparency is important, but others might see the author's position as reasonable. Since both have valid points, the answer might hinge on whether the author's refusal to comply with her specific request is a deal-breaker. If the girlfriend's anxiety is leading to a breakdown in trust, that's a problem. But the author isn't being deceptive; he's just keeping a part of his life private. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because both sides have valid perspectives and the issue is about differing needs in the relationship.\n"
