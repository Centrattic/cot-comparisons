We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a one-year relationship, mostly only seeing each other on weekends. The girl wants him to tell her in the moment he's watching porn, but he feels ashamed and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that knowing when he does it calms her. Maybe she's feeling insecure or has trust issues. Communication is key in relationships, so her asking for transparency is understandable. On the other hand, the author feels it's a personal, private activity that he wants to handle alone without sharing. It's a common desire for some people to keep certain things private, especially if it's a sensitive topic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are mutual respect and communication. The author isn't refusing to talk about it entirely; he's just not wanting to share the exact timing. The girlfriend might feel that any secrecy is a problem, but the author has his reasons for privacy. It's important to find a middle ground where both feel respected.\n\nAnother angle is consent and boundaries. The author isn't doing anything harmful; he's engaging in a legal activity. However, the girlfriend's emotional needs are valid. The conflict arises from differing needs for privacy versus reassurance. The author's discomfort in discussing it in the moment might be reasonable, as some people find it embarrassing. But the girlfriend's request is about feeling secure, which is also important.\n\nI should also consider if there's a compromise possible. Maybe the author could tell her after the fact, rather than in the moment, which might satisfy both. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not telling her immediately. Since both have valid points, it's a matter of negotiation. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to disclose in the moment, but he might need to explain his perspective to her and see if they can find a solution that works for both.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his feelings of privacy and discomfort are valid, and it's a personal choice that doesn't harm her. However, he should communicate this to her to maintain trust and understanding. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, which could be a nuanced answer. Since the situation is about differing needs and not clear harm, it's not a straightforward right or wrong. But leaning towards B because the author's perspective is understandable and he's not violating any direct boundary yet.\n"
