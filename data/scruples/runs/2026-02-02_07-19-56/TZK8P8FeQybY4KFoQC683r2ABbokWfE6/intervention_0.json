We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (19M) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend (17F) exactly when he watches porn. They've been in a relationship for a year, and she wants him to inform her in real-time, while he feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing so. He wants to keep it private for personal relief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and reassurance. She's younger (17) and might be more sensitive to his actions, even though she's accepted that he watches porn. Her needing to know in the moment could be about feeling secure in the relationship. On the other hand, the guy feels that it's a private, personal activity that he doesn't want to discuss, especially during the times when he's doing it. He's 19, and this is a common issue in relationships, where privacy and communication can clash.\n\nThe question is whether not complying with her request makes him wrong. Communication is key in relationships, but boundaries are also important. The girlfriend's request might be reasonable in her eyes, but his discomfort and the nature of the activity (something he does for personal reasons) might justify his stance. However, the problem here isn't just about telling in the moment but about the emotional impact. If she's feeling anxious that he's not communicating, maybe there's a bigger issue about trust or insecurity.\n\nBut in this case, the guy isn't hiding it entirely; he's just not telling her in real-time. He's already sharing that he watches porn, which she's accepted. The issue is the timing of the disclosure. The question is whether the act of not informing her while doing it is a breach of trust or a reasonable privacy boundary. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have different comfort levels regarding such topics. What's important is mutual respect. If the girl's request is causing him significant discomfort, perhaps there's a compromise. But if he's not communicating at all, that could be a problem. However, since he's already being open about watching porn, the issue is the immediacy of the disclosure. \n\nFrom a general standpoint, if someone is doing something that their partner wants to know about in real-time, refusing to comply might be seen as not respecting their feelings. But if the action is something private and the partner is already aware, maybe the guy isn't in the wrong for not wanting to share the exact timing. The key is whether the refusal is causing unnecessary harm. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. The girl's need for reassurance is valid, but if the guy feels ashamed and it's making him uncomfortable, maybe the request is too intrusive. However, since the relationship is important, both need to find a middle ground. But the question is if he's in the wrong. If the request is for transparency and he's refusing without a valid reason, then maybe he is. But if his reasons are about personal privacy and it's a one-time use without harm, perhaps not. \n\nIn this case, the author is not in the wrong because his reasons are about personal privacy and comfort. The girlfriend's request is reasonable, but the author's feelings are also valid. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, since relationships require communication, maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about solving the issue. Given the information, the answer is B.\n"
