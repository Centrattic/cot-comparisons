We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old guy who's in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girl. They only see each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. His girlfriend wants him to tell her exactly when he's watching porn, but he feels ashamed and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in a long-distance situation since he studies in a different city. Communication is important in such relationships. The girl wants to know when he's watching porn, which she says calms her. But he's uncomfortable with that. \n\nNow, the key points here are consent and mutual respect. The girl's request is about transparency, which is understandable if she feels anxious or insecure. However, the guy's right to privacy is also a factor. Watching porn is a personal activity, and expecting someone to disclose it in real-time might be too much, especially if it causes them discomfort. \n\nLegally, both are adults, though the girl is 17. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be age of consent laws, but that's probably not the focus here. The main issue is about their mutual expectations in the relationship. \n\nThe guy feels that the request makes him ashamed. That's a valid emotional response. On the other hand, the girl's need for reassurance is also valid. But is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. It's a matter of balancing both perspectives. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. They need to find a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not agreeing to her request. Since he's expressing his feelings of discomfort and the girl is expecting something she feels makes her calm, there's a clash. \n\nBut is it his fault? It's possible he's not wrong. People have different comfort levels. Forcing someone to disclose personal activities in real-time could be seen as overstepping, especially if it causes emotional distress. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any other angle. \n\nAlso, considering the age difference, though both are close in age, they're both young. Young relationships can have varying levels of maturity in handling such issues. The girl's request might stem from insecurity, but the guy's autonomy is important. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They need to communicate better, but his refusal isn't inherently wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
