We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants to know in real-time, while the author feels ashamed and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication in relationships. Open communication is usually key. The girlfriend is expressing her needs, which is completely valid. She finds comfort in knowing when he does it, so her request isn't just about control but about emotional reassurance. That's important.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is feeling uncomfortable. Watching porn is a private activity for him, and sharing the exact timing might add stress. He's not hiding it; he's been open about it, and she's accepted it. Now, she wants more transparency, which is reasonable but might not align with his comfort level.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could check in after the fact without being there while he does it? Like a text message later. But she wants immediate notification. He's not being dishonest, but he's also not meeting her emotional needs. \n\nThe age difference and maturity levels might play a role. She's 17, which is a young age where she might need more reassurance. However, the author is 19, and both are adults (legally). The key issue is mutual respect. He needs to respect her feelings, even if he doesn't fully understand them. At the same time, she needs to respect his privacy and discomfort.\n\nIs he being unreasonable? If the agreement was not to tell her in real-time, but she's now changing the terms, there's a need for negotiation. But if he's not violating any prior agreement, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should address each other's feelings. His refusal might lead to her feeling unsecured, which can affect the relationship negatively. It's a balance between privacy and emotional support. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because his feelings are valid. But he might need to find a way to compromise, like informing her after the fact, rather than in real-time. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), because it's a matter of differing needs and not necessarily a right or wrong. However, there's room for discussion and compromise.\n"
