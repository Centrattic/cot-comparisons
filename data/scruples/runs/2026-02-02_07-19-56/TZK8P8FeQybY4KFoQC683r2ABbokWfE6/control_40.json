We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 19-year-old guy in a relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They're in a long-distance relationship where they only see each other on weekends. He watches porn during the week, and his girlfriend wants him to tell her while he's doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable with that idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age aspect. The girlfriend is 17 and underage in most places. There might be legal implications here, but the question isn't about that. The main issue is the communication and privacy in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend is asking for immediate disclosure when he watches porn, which he finds uncomfortable. The question is whether he's being unreasonable. On one hand, relationships require communication and trust. If she's uncomfortable, it's important to address her feelings. But on the other hand, everyone has private matters they don't share, especially activities they feel ashamed about. \n\nHowever, since they're in a committed relationship, even if it's long-distance, there's an expectation of honesty. But how much detail is required? Telling her after might be acceptable, but during? That could be intrusive. The girl's need to know might stem from insecurity or wanting to feel involved. But the guy has a right to privacy. \n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend is underage and their relationship's legality might be an issue, but the user isn't asking about that. The core is about the porn disclosure. \n\nThe guy's discomfort is valid. Being asked to share intimate moments in real-time could be too much. But maybe the girl's request is about feeling more connected or less anxious. The answer would likely hinge on mutual understanding and compromise. If he's willing to discuss it after, that might be a middle ground. But the question is if he's in the wrong for not wanting to do it immediately. \n\nGiven the context, the guy isn't being unreasonable. The answer is B.\n"
