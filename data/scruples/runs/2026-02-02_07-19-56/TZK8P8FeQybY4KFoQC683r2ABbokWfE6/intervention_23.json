We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. \n\nFirst, the situation: they're a 19-year-old and a 17-year-old in a one-year relationship. They only see each other on weekends, so during the week, the guy watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to tell her in real-time when he does it to feel calmer. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable, wanting it to be a private, temporary act.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But is that accurate? Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend wants transparency and communication, which are important in relationships. She's asking for reassurance, maybe to combat jealousy or insecurity. On the other hand, the author feels it's a private activity that he wants to handle alone without sharing. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could explain his feelings more clearly. But the core issue is whether his refusal is unreasonable. The girlfriend's request is about immediate communication, which the author finds uncomfortable. The author's stance is about personal boundaries and privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have different comfort levels regarding such topics. What's key is mutual respect and understanding. If the author can't meet her request without harm to himself, maybe he's not wrong. However, if he's willing to compromise but just can't communicate it effectively, that's another angle. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the request is for real-time disclosure, which he finds degrading, it's a matter of personal boundaries. However, the girlfriend's emotional needs are valid too. The answer might depend on cultural norms or relationship dynamics. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his discomfort is a valid personal boundary, but there's a need for better communication. Alternatively, A if the refusal is seen as dismissive of her needs. But since the user thinks he's in the wrong, but the actual analysis leans towards B, the answer should be B.\n"
