We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. The main issue is about whether the author is required to tell their girlfriend exactly when they watch porn.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is separated during the week, and the author watches porn. The girlfriend wants to be informed in real-time when he does this, but the author feels uncomfortable with this request. The relationship is a year old, and she's already accepted that he watches porn, just wants to know when it happens.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. There's a balance between personal privacy and a partner's need for reassurance. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or a desire for openness. However, the author feels that this request makes him ashamed and uncomfortable. \n\nIt's important to consider mutual respect. If the girlfriend's needs are causing the author significant discomfort, then there's a need for compromise. However, the author's refusal might also be seen as not respecting her emotional needs. \n\nI should also think about norms and expectations. Some people might find real-time disclosure reasonable, others not. Since the author is 19 and his girlfriend is 17, there's a minor age difference, but both are adults in most places. The core issue is about boundaries and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author's argument is about wanting to do something alone without sharing the exact timing, which is a personal boundary. The girlfriend's request is about her emotional well-being. If the author can't meet her needs without feeling ashamed, maybe there's a deeper issue in the relationship. But it's also about personal autonomy. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author has the right to privacy and personal boundaries. However, it's crucial for both to communicate and find a middle ground. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to disclose in real-time, but there's a need for discussion to address both partners' feelings.\n"
