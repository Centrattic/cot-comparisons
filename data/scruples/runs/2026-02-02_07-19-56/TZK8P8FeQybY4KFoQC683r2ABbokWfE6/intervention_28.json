We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple dealing with the girlfriend wanting to know exactly when the guy watches porn, while he feels uncomfortable sharing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend already dislikes that he watches porn but has accepted it. Now she wants him to tell her while he's doing it to feel calmer. The author refuses because it makes him ashamed and uncomfortable. He wants it to be a private, quick relief without strings.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries, privacy, and mutual respect. The girlfriend's request is based on her need for reassurance, which is reasonable. However, the author's refusal is also about his comfort and privacy. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nI should think about communication in relationships. Open and honest communication is important. The girlfriend is trying to express her feelings and needs, which is a valid approach. But the author's discomfort is also valid. The challenge here is finding a middle ground where both partners feel heard and respected.\n\nIs there a way for the author to communicate his feelings without being dismissive? Maybe he can explain why it's important to him to keep it private, while also acknowledging her need for reassurance. Perhaps they can negotiate a compromise, like checking in with each other in a different way that doesn't intrude on his privacy as much.\n\nBut the original question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not willing to meet her halfway or at least try to find a solution that addresses both their needs, then he might be seen as being in the wrong. However, if he's genuinely unable to comply due to his feelings of shame and privacy, then it's a matter of mutual understanding.\n\nConsidering that the girlfriend has accepted his porn use already, her request for more transparency might be reasonable. The author's refusal without finding an alternative could be seen as not respecting her feelings. On the other hand, if he's honest about his discomfort and they can find another way to address her concerns, maybe it's not the end of the world.\n\nBut in this case, since he's not offering any alternatives and is just refusing, it might be seen as his being in the wrong. So the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, maybe not. Maybe the answer is that it's not entirely his fault because privacy is important. This is a bit of a nuanced situation. However, given the context, the girlfriend's request is about transparency and trust, which are important in a relationship. If the author can't meet her halfway, it might lead to issues.\n\nHmm. So after considering both sides, I think the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing his partner's emotional needs, even if his own privacy is important. The key is mutual respect here. Since the girlfriend is already uncomfortable with the porn use and wants reassurance, not meeting her halfway could be seen as prioritizing his own comfort over her emotional well-being. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
