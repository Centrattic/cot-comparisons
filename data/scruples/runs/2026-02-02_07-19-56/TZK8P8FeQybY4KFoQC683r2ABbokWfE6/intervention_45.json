We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with his 17-year-old girlfriend. They only see each other on weekends, and he's in another city for studying during the week. He watches porn, which his girlfriend initially disliked but has now accepted. Now she wants him to tell her exactly when he does it while he's doing it, because it calms her. He doesn't agree; it makes him ashamed and uncomfortable. He wants it to be something he does alone and quickly forgets. He's asking if he's unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girlfriend wants transparency during the act, which the author finds uncomfortable. The author's reasoning is about privacy and feeling ashamed. The girlfriend's reasoning is about reassurance.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both parties should feel heard and respected. However, boundaries are also important. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or a need for control. The author's discomfort suggests that her request is overstepping his personal boundaries. \n\nBut is the author being unreasonable? Well, sharing such personal activity in real-time might be intrusive. The girlfriend might not realize that the act of watching porn is something the author wants to keep private. However, the fact that they've had this conversation before and she's accepted it now wants more from him. \n\nThe age difference is 17 and 19, which is a minor difference, but she's still young. Maybe she's trying to assert her feelings, but the author's feelings also matter. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, both partners have valid feelings. However, the author's refusal isn't about lying or hiding but about personal discomfort. The girlfriend might need to understand that his privacy is important for his mental space. \n\nOn the other hand, the author should communicate his feelings clearly and explain why he feels the way he does. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting a time to talk about it later, rather than during the act. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author isn't violating any prior agreement and his reasons are based on his personal discomfort, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's request might be unreasonable, expecting immediate disclosure during the act, which is an intimate moment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because his refusal is about personal boundaries and discomfort, and communication about such a private act can be a mutual negotiation. The key is that both sides need to find a compromise, but the author isn't wrong for not complying with a request that makes him uncomfortable.\n"
