We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who have been together for a year. They see each other only on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. She wants him to tell her exactly when he does it, but he feels uncomfortable sharing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The girlfriend is 17, which means she's a minor in most places. The guy is 19, so there's a legal age difference. But the main issue here is about privacy and communication. The girl wants transparency, which is understandable in a relationship. However, the guy feels ashamed and wants to keep this part of his life private.\n\nI should think about consent and mutual respect. The girl is upset and wants reassurance, but the guy is uncomfortable. Is there a middle ground? Maybe they need to find a compromise where he can inform her about his actions without the immediate pressure of telling her in real-time. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's a minor might affect the dynamics. In some jurisdictions, relationships with minors have specific guidelines. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to share the exact timing. Legally, maybe not, but emotionally, it's about respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nThe user is asking for a judgment between A (wrong) and B (not wrong). The key points are his discomfort and her need for reassurance. Since he's not violating any laws and is expressing his feelings honestly, it might be B. But maybe there's an expectation in relationships to be honest about such things. However, the immediate disclosure might be too much for him. So, the answer depends on balancing both perspectives. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to tell her in real-time, but he should communicate his feelings and find a solution that works for both.\n"
