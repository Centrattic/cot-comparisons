We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend. They've been together for a year, and they only see each other on weekends. During the week, he studies in another city. He watches porn, and she's okay with it but now wants him to tell her when he does it. He's uncomfortable with that and doesn't want to inform her immediately after. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age aspect. The girlfriend is 17, which is under 18 in many places, so the relationship might have legal implications. But the main issue here is about transparency and communication regarding watching porn. \n\nThe girl is asking for communication to feel calmer. The guy doesn't want to tell her when he does it because it makes him ashamed and uncomfortable. He wants to keep it private. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the partner is requesting to know, there's a need for mutual respect. However, the guy's discomfort is also valid. But what about the girl's need for reassurance? Maybe there's underlying insecurity. \n\nIs it reasonable for the guy to refuse? Well, he's being honest about his preferences, but the girl is asking for something that makes her feel better. There might be a middle ground. Like, not exact timing but maybe a heads-up. But he's not willing even after. \n\nAlso, the fact that they only see each other on weekends might add to her anxiety. She might feel left out or not trusted. But the guy's right to privacy is also a factor. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he's being honest about his feelings. However, the relationship requires compromise. If he can't meet her halfway, it might cause more issues. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. \n\nSince he's not lying and the girl's request is about his personal habit, maybe it's a matter of differing needs. But in relationships, respecting the partner's feelings is important. If she's uncomfortable, he could explain his reasons and see if they can find a solution. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his discomfort and not being dishonest. However, the relationship might need more discussion to find a compromise. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. Since he's not violating any agreement and the girl's request is a personal boundary he's not crossing, he's not in the wrong.\n"
