      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn.\n\nFirst, the situation: A 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They only see each other on weekends; he's away studying elsewhere. He watches porn during the week. She's okay with it now but wants him to tell her while he does it to feel calm. He's uncomfortable and doesn't want to because it's a private act he wants to forget quickly.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's request is about communication and her emotional needs. She wants reassurance, maybe to feel included or to have boundaries. On the other hand, the guy feels shamed and wants privacy. Porn is a personal activity, and he might see no reason to share it in real-time. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in relationships, communication is key. If she's expressing a need, ignoring it without discussion could be seen as dismissive. But he's also within his rights to value his privacy. The key is whether he's respecting her feelings without compromising his own comfort. \n\nHe's not hiding it\u2014he watches it and she's aware. The issue is the timing of disclosure. She wants immediate communication during the act, which he finds uncomfortable. Maybe a middle ground exists, like checking in later without the pressure of real-time sharing. But the author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs enough, which could be a point of conflict. However, he's also not violating any boundaries he's agreed to. It's a balance between mutual respect. \n\nIn many relationships, partners negotiate these things. If he's open to discussing it and finding a compromise that respects both their needs, then it's a valid stance. But if he's rigid and dismissive of her feelings, that's where the fault could lie. The question is whether he's being unreasonable. Since he's explaining his discomfort and not being secretive (he's already disclosed the fact he watches porn), maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's maintaining privacy and hasn't been dishonest. However, there's room for negotiation. The key is whether the refusal to share in real-time is a deal-breaker. Since the girlfriend's request is about her comfort, and he's trying to explain his side, it's more about differing needs rather than right or wrong. So the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
