      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation involves a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who are in a one-year relationship. They only see each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. The girlfriend wants him to tell her when he does it, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable, preferring to keep it private for quick relief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The girlfriend is 17, which in many places is under the age of consent. However, the user is 19. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could be a legal issue. But the question here is about the moral or relational aspect, not legality. The focus is on the porn-watching and the disagreement about transparency.\n\nThe girlfriend wants to know immediately after he watches porn, which he finds uncomfortable. He argues it's for personal relief and doesn't want to discuss it. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and boundaries. In healthy relationships, both partners should feel respected and heard. The girlfriend's request is about her emotional need for reassurance, while his refusal is about his comfort and privacy.\n\nIs it reasonable for him to refuse? Well, sharing such personal information can be a privacy issue. However, the girlfriend's discomfort suggests that she feels insecure or anxious about his porn use. The author's stance is that he doesn't want to discuss it, which might be his right, but it's also important to address her feelings. If communication is lacking, that could be a problem.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's honest and communicates his feelings without being forced to disclose every instance, maybe he's not wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels she's being kept in the dark and it's causing her distress, then maybe there's a need for compromise. But the request here is immediate disclosure each time, which could be impractical and invade his privacy. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend is okay with him watching porn but just wants some communication to ease her anxiety, perhaps the author could find a middle ground without detailing every instance. However, the author's reason for not wanting to disclose is based on shame and discomfort, which he has a right to feel. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal is reasonable. Since the girlfriend is in a gray area legally (depending on the location), but the main issue is about their relationship dynamics. The author's discomfort is valid, but the girlfriend's emotional needs aren't being met. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If he's not violating any agreements or harming her directly, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the lack of communication is causing her distress and he's not making an effort to understand her perspective, that could be an issue. \n\nBut given the context, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because personal privacy and comfort are important, and the request seems excessive. However, healthy relationships require mutual understanding. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and if it's about the immediate disclosure, maybe not. The key is that both sides need to communicate better, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to share that detail.\n"
