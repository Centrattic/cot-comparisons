      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a young couple with a long-distance setup. The guy is 19, his girlfriend is 17, and they've been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and during the week, he studies in a different city.\n\nThe main issue is about him watching porn. The girlfriend wants him to tell her immediately when he does it, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful. He argues that it's just for quick relief and he wants to keep it private. The question is whether he's unreasonable for not wanting to inform her right away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They're both young, and there's a two-year age difference. The girlfriend is 17, which is the age of majority in some places but not in others. The fact that they're in a long-distance relationship might mean they have different dynamics in communication and trust. \n\nThe girlfriend is asking for transparency to feel calm, which might stem from insecurity or a desire for honesty in the relationship. On the other hand, the guy feels that this act is private and that he wants to handle it alone without involving her. This is a common issue in relationships where boundaries around personal behaviors are discussed.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the refusal to disclose immediately is unreasonable. In many relationships, open communication is key, but there are also personal boundaries. Pornography use is a sensitive topic. Some people might find it intrusive to have their partner know the exact timing of such activities, especially if it's a private matter that doesn't affect the relationship negatively beyond the emotional aspect.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's request is about immediate disclosure. The guy is willing to tell her after the fact but not while doing it. The question is if that's a fair compromise. If the girlfriend's need is for reassurance and the guy can't meet that, there might be a mismatch in expectations. But if he's willing to be honest afterwards, maybe that's sufficient.\n\nLegally and ethically, as long as both parties are of legal age and in a consensual relationship, the guy isn't doing anything wrong. His discomfort is valid. However, relationships require negotiation. If the girlfriend's request is causing him significant distress, perhaps she should reconsider her approach. Alternatively, maybe there's a middle ground where he can communicate the timing without being in the act.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The girlfriend is 17, which in some jurisdictions could be an issue, but assuming they're in a place where it's legal, that's not the focus here. The focus is on the communication issue.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might see the guy as reasonable for wanting privacy, while others might think the girlfriend has a right to know. But since it's a consensual activity and not harmful, the guy's stance could be justified. The problem arises when one partner's needs conflict with the other's boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the guy's refusal is unreasonable. If he's already transparent after the fact and the issue is the immediacy, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's request is about her emotional needs, but the guy's privacy and comfort are also important. They might need to find a compromise that respects both their needs without forcing either to do something they're uncomfortable with.\n\nTherefore, considering all factors, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as he's maintaining his boundaries, and the girlfriend's request is about her emotional state rather than a moral issue.\n"
