We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a couple with a long-distance aspect, meeting only on weekends. The girl wants him to inform her right after he watches porn to feel calmer, but he finds it shameful and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and her emotional well-being. She's trying to build trust and reduce her anxiety by knowing when it happens. On the other hand, the author feels that it's a personal activity he doesn't want to discuss, which is a common sentiment among men. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. The girl might feel that honesty is important for their trust, while the author might see it as an invasion of privacy. The age difference (19 and 17) might also play a role in their maturity levels and how they handle such issues.\n\nThe author's discomfort is valid; some people do find it embarrassing to discuss such personal habits, even if they're consensual and harmless. However, the girlfriend's need for reassurance isn't unreasonable either. The challenge is finding a middle ground where both feel respected.\n\nLooking at the options, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's request is reasonable and he's refusing without compromise, that could be seen as dismissive. But if the request is too intrusive and the author's privacy is also a factor, then he might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to disclose the exact times, but there's room for dialogue. Maybe he can explain his feelings and see if there's another way she can feel reassured without needing real-time updates. The answer would hinge on mutual understanding rather than a strict right or wrong.\n"
