We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a one-year relationship, only see each other on weekends. He studies in a different city and watches porn during the week. The girlfriend wants him to inform her in real-time when he does it, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's stance is that she wants to know to feel calmed. Maybe she's concerned about his habits or feels insecure. On the other hand, the author feels that it's a private matter he wants to handle alone for stress relief, and he doesn't want to discuss it immediately after.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. However, there's also the aspect of personal privacy. The act of watching porn is legal and common, but the disagreement here is about the disclosure of when he does it. The girlfriend is asking for real-time updates, which the author finds intrusive and uncomfortable. \n\nI should think about whether there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could communicate his feelings without being fully transparent about the exact timing. For example, he could reassure her periodically without giving specific times. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong by not wanting to share the exact moment.\n\nThe author's discomfort and shame might indicate that he feels guilty about his actions, which could be a red flag. If he's ashamed, maybe there's an underlying issue with his porn use that he should reflect on. However, the request from his girlfriend seems extreme. Real-time disclosure is not typical unless there's a specific reason, like addiction or betrayal. Since the author mentions it's for \"quick relief\" and they have a distance, maybe it's a normal part of his routine.\n\nBut the girlfriend's need for reassurance is valid. She might be struggling with trust or anxiety. The author's refusal to meet her halfway in communication could be seen as dismissive. However, insisting on real-time updates might be unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author's privacy and personal space are important, especially in a situation where they aren't together. The girlfriend's request is about her emotional needs, which are also important. But the author's discomfort is significant. \n\nI think the author is not entirely wrong because it's his private behavior and he's already disclosed it. The girlfriend's request for real-time updates might be overstepping. However, there's a need for mutual understanding. If the author can explain his feelings and suggest alternative ways to reassure her, that might be better. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would depend on cultural or personal norms. In some relationships, real-time disclosure is expected, but generally, not sharing exact times isn't wrong if it's not affecting the relationship negatively. The author's stance is about personal privacy and comfort, which are valid. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
