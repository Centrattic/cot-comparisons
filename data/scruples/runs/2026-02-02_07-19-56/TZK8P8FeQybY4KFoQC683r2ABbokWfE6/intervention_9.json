We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend are in a long-distance relationship. They see each other only on weekends, and he studies in another city. He watches porn during the week, which his girlfriend doesn't like but has accepted. Now, she wants him to tell her exactly when he watches it, which makes him uncomfortable because he feels ashamed and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's request is to know when he does it, which she says calms her. Maybe she feels insecure or anxious because of the long-distance aspect. On the other hand, the guy feels that this is something personal and private, and he wants to keep it to himself. \n\nI should think about communication in relationships. Open communication is important, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's request might stem from a need for reassurance, but the guy's discomfort is also valid. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. \n\nIs it reasonable for her to ask for this level of detail? If she's uncomfortable with his porn use, maybe she should address the root cause of her discomfort rather than the timing. However, she's already accepted that he watches it, so maybe her request is about control or trust issues. \n\nFor the guy, not wanting to disclose the exact times might be about privacy. But since they're in a relationship, there's an expectation of some level of transparency. However, the line between privacy and transparency can be blurry. \n\nI should also consider societal norms. Some people might find it odd to discuss such personal habits with a partner, while others might see it as part of healthy communication. The guy's feeling of shame could be a red flag if it's affecting the relationship negatively. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. If the girlfriend is pressuring him into something that makes him uncomfortable, it might be an issue of respect. But if he's being uncooperative without understanding her perspective, that's also a problem. \n\nI need to check if the question is whether he's wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. The answer depends on whether his refusal is justified. Since he's not hiding the fact that he watches porn, just the timing, his stance could be seen as reasonable. But if her request is about trust and she's trying to feel secure, maybe he should find a middle ground. \n\nIn conclusion, neither is entirely in the wrong. But if I have to pick A or B, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because his privacy is valid. If A, then maybe because he's not respecting her needs. Since the user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion, I need to decide based on the balance of privacy vs. communication needs.\n"
