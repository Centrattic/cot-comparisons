We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he and his girlfriend have a disagreement about him watching porn. She wants him to tell her exactly when he does it, while he does it, which makes him uncomfortable. He argues that it's just for relief and he wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, communication is key in any relationship. The girlfriend is asking for openness to feel secure, which is a valid need. But the author feels ashamed and doesn't want to discuss it immediately after. So there's a conflict between her need for reassurance and his need for privacy and comfort.\n\nHe mentions they've been in a relationship for a year, and she's accepted it to some extent. Now she's pushing for more transparency. Maybe she's still uneasy and wants to feel involved. But the author is unwilling to comply because it makes him uncomfortable. \n\nIs he being unreasonable? Well, he's not hiding that he watches porn; he's just not disclosing the exact times. He's willing to talk about it after, which might not satisfy her current request. However, his discomfort is a valid emotion. There's no right or wrong here in a black-and-white sense. \n\nRelationships require compromise. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, maybe he's being a bit rigid. But if she's making him uncomfortable by asking for something he's not ready to do, she might need to reassess her approach. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. It's more about finding a middle ground where both feel respected. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong. But it's a complicated situation where both need to communicate better.\n"
