      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who've been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends; he's in a different city for school. He watches porn during the week, which she's okay with now but still doesn't like. She wants him to tell her exactly when he watches it, while he's doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable and wants to keep it private. The question is whether he's unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points here. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and reassurance. She might feel insecure or want to feel involved in the relationship. On the other hand, the guy feels that this is a private activity he wants to keep to himself, maybe even for his own mental space. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. Both parties should express their needs and concerns. The girlfriend is asking for something specific to help her feel calm, and the guy is hesitant because it makes him uncomfortable. Is his hesitation unreasonable?\n\nBut here's the thing: the age of consent might be a factor. In many places, 17 is under 18, so he's with a minor. Even though the situation is about porn consumption, the legal implications of the relationship itself could be an issue. However, the main question here is about the porn disclosure.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, people often have personal habits they don't share. Watching porn is a common activity, but the level of disclosure can vary. The girlfriend's request is a bit unusual\u2014telling her in real-time. That might be more about control or insecurity than a typical request. The guy's discomfort is valid; sharing such a personal act in real-time could be seen as intrusive.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's feelings are also important. If she's feeling anxious or needs reassurance, there might be deeper issues in the relationship that need addressing. The fact that they only see each other on weekends could contribute to her needing that level of communication.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's not being dishonest, just not disclosing something she wants. But if the agreement was to not tell her and now she's changing her mind, perhaps he's not unreasonable. Alternatively, if the conversation about porn was a mutual understanding that he doesn't have to disclose specifics, then he's within his rights.\n\nBut given that she's younger and more emotionally vulnerable, maybe he should prioritize her feelings. However, the request to tell her while doing it seems extreme. It's a privacy issue. The guy's discomfort is valid. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
