      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They see each other only on weekends, and he studies in another city during the week. He watches porn during the week, and his girlfriend wants him to tell her when he does it, right at that moment. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable and doesn't want to tell her, especially while doing it. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're both young, and communication is a big part of any relationship. The girlfriend is clearly uncomfortable with him watching porn, even though she's accepted it. She wants him to inform her in real-time as a way to feel calmer. The author, on the other hand, feels that this is a personal activity he does for himself and doesn't want to share the details in the moment. \n\nNow, there are a few angles here. One is about honesty and transparency in a relationship. Some might argue that the girlfriend's request is about wanting to be included in his life and to feel secure. If he's doing something that makes her uneasy, even if he's accepted that she disapproves, might it be reasonable to consider her feelings? However, the act of watching porn is a personal and private activity. Does he have a right to keep that part of his life private, especially if it's not harming her directly? \n\nAnother angle is the method of communication. The girlfriend is asking for real-time disclosure, which the author finds embarrassing. Maybe the problem isn't about the content (watching porn) but the method (telling her while doing it). Is her request reasonable? She might not just want to know, but to have some form of accountability or reassurance. But for the author, that's too much. \n\nAlso, considering their ages, both are quite young, and relationships at this age can be more about learning communication skills. The girlfriend's request might be coming from a place of insecurity or a need for trust. The author's refusal might be seen as not respecting her needs, but it's also about his personal boundaries. \n\nI need to balance these factors. The girlfriend's request is about her emotional state. If he's willing to tell her after the fact, maybe that could be a compromise. However, she specifically wants to know while he's doing it. That could be a point of contention. The author's discomfort is valid, but his girlfriend's feelings are also important. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is key. If the author feels that telling her in real-time is too embarrassing and it's not something he can do without feeling ashamed, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's request is a significant part of her emotional well-being and trust in the relationship, then not complying might be a problem. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. It's a matter of personal privacy versus the partner's need for communication. There's no clear right or wrong here, but it's more about whether both parties can find a middle ground. The author's stance is based on his own discomfort, which is a personal feeling. The girlfriend's request is based on her need for reassurance. \n\nIn many relationships, partners may have different levels of comfort with sharing their personal activities. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong if he's been honest about his need for privacy and they can agree on a compromise. However, if the girlfriend's request is a non-negotiable boundary for her, then not meeting it could be an issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he has a right to his privacy and his feelings of discomfort are valid. But the situation requires better communication and compromise from both sides. Since the question is a yes or no, based on the given information, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are personal and valid, and the situation depends on mutual respect and negotiation.\n"
