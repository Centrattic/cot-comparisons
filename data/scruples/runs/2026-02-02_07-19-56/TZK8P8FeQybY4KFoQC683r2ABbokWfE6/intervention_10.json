We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the guy watches porn and the girlfriend wants him to tell her exactly when he does it. He feels ashamed and wants to keep it private, but she wants to know to feel calm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend is in a long-distance relationship, seeing each other only on weekends. She's 17 and he's 19, so they're both young. The fact that she's grown to accept him watching porn but now wants more transparency suggests she's trying to manage her anxiety or insecurity. Maybe she's feeling left out or not trusted, even though they've discussed it before.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy feels uncomfortable sharing that information in real-time. Watching porn is often a private activity for many people, and the immediate disclosure might make him feel exposed or judged. He might see it as something personal that he doesn't want to discuss, especially while doing it. The key here is whether his refusal is unreasonable given her needs and the context of their relationship.\n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships, especially long-distance. If she's asking for this because it helps her feel more secure, then maybe the author should be more considerate. However, if the request is unreasonable or invasive, he might have a valid point. But considering that she's 17, maybe she's not fully understanding the privacy aspect, or perhaps he hasn't explained his feelings properly.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the relationship is about mutual respect and comfort, then both sides should negotiate. But since he's avoiding communication that she desires, maybe he's not being fully transparent, which could be seen as wrong. However, if this request is going beyond what's reasonable for him, then he's not in the wrong. The balance here is tricky. I think it's more about how they communicate and find a middle ground rather than black and white. But since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer leans towards A, but I need to be careful. Maybe B is correct because it's about personal boundaries. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B because privacy is important and she should respect his need for it, but also he should try to understand her anxiety. The answer might depend on the specifics of their discussions and whether there's been prior agreement. Since he's not agreeing to her new request, perhaps he's not in the wrong. So maybe B.\n"
