      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a 19-year-old guy and a 17-year-old girl in a one-year relationship. They see each other only on weekends, and he studies in a different city. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it but wants him to tell her exactly when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing that, so he's asking if he's unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 17, which is the age of majority in many places, but relationships between 17 and 19 are legal in most jurisdictions. However, there's a 2-year age difference. The key issue here is communication and boundaries.\n\nHe watches porn, which she initially disliked but has accepted. Now she wants him to inform her in real-time. His argument is that he feels ashamed and wants to keep it private. She feels that knowing calms her anxiety. \n\nIs he being unreasonable? Well, communication is crucial in relationships. If she's asking for something that makes him uncomfortable, there's a balance between her need for reassurance and his privacy. However, the request seems a bit extreme. Telling her exactly when he watches porn in real-time could be seen as intrusive. Most people might agree that being honest about such habits is important, but constant updates might cross into territory that's too much for him. \n\nAlso, considering he wants it to be a private act for quick relief, it's reasonable that he doesn't want to share the exact timing. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity, but it's on him to communicate his feelings. However, he did mention they had a conversation about it and she's accepted it, so now she's changing her stance. That could indicate she's not fully respecting his boundaries if he's already made a compromise by not hiding it entirely. \n\nBut if he's not causing harm by not informing her in real-time, then maybe he's not wrong. On the other hand, if he agreed earlier to be open about it, then maybe not informing her now is a breach of that agreement. Wait, the original question says she \"has grown to accept it,\" so maybe the acceptance isn't full transparency. \n\nAlso, the act of watching porn is a personal matter. While being honest is good, the method of communication matters. If he's open about it generally but doesn't need to give a heads-up every time, that's reasonable. The girlfriend might need reassurance, but there are other ways to address her anxiety without him having to disclose each instance. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's refusal isn't unreasonable. He's prioritizing his privacy and comfort, which is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
