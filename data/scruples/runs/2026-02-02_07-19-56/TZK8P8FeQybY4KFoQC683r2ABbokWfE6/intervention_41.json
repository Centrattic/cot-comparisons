She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation involves a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who have been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and during the week, the guy studies in a different city. He watches porn, which she's okay with now but initially disliked. She wants him to tell her when he does it, while he's doing it, to calm her. He refuses because it's embarrassing and he wants to move on from it quickly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like pornography. The girlfriend is expressing a need for reassurance and openness. She's not just asking for information; she's asking for real-time communication during an activity she's uncomfortable with. That might be her way of feeling more secure in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that the request is intrusive and makes him uncomfortable. Watching porn is a private activity for him, and he wants to keep it that way. He's not hiding it from her; he's just not willing to share the exact timing. He's also in a situation where they don't see each other often, so maybe he's prioritizing his own privacy and emotional space.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual respect. If both parties have discussed and agreed on boundaries, then respecting those boundaries is important. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or past experiences. Maybe she feels that if he tells her while doing it, it's a sign of transparency. But the author isn't comfortable with that level of disclosure.\n\nAnother angle is the age difference. She's 17, which is a minor in many places, but they're in a relationship. However, the question isn't about legality but about right and wrong in communication. The core issue is about honesty versus privacy.\n\nIn relationships, partners often have different levels of comfort regarding privacy. The girlfriend wants more openness, and the author wants privacy. Both have valid points. But is the author in the wrong for not acceding to her request? It depends on whether the request is reasonable. If she's asking for something that makes him deeply uncomfortable, maybe she's being unreasonable. But if he's agreed to some level of openness but is now refusing a specific part, that could be seen as a lack of cooperation.\n\nAlso, considering that the girlfriend has accepted him watching porn, but now wants more information. It's a step further in communication. The author might be avoiding a necessary conversation about boundaries and mutual understanding. However, his discomfort is real and shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. Both sides have valid points. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing to tell her immediately, I need to assess if his refusal is unjustified. If there's no prior agreement on this specific request, and he's not violating any existing agreement, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that he's not being fully transparent about his actions might affect trust. But since he's already disclosed that he watches porn, just not the exact timing, it's a matter of how much detail he shares.\n\nI think the key is whether the request is intrusive. If she wants to know in real-time, that's asking for something that's part of his private time. He's not hiding the fact that he watches it, just the timing. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the request is causing her distress, then there's a need for compromise. However, the question is about right or wrong, not about whether they can find a middle ground.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is about personal privacy, and the girlfriend's is about reassurance. Without prior agreement, his refusal isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
