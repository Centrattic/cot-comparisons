We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend who've been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends because they live in different cities. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it now but wants him to tell her exactly when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable about it and doesn't want to tell her immediately after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl wants transparency because it calms her. That makes sense; maybe she's trying to manage her anxiety or build trust. On the other hand, the guy feels that this act is private and something he wants to do alone. He might feel that sharing such personal moments could lead to guilt or pressure, which is why he's uncomfortable.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and communication in relationships. Healthy relationships require open communication, but they also respect each other's boundaries. The girl's request is for more information, which could be about trust. However, the guy's discomfort is valid because he might not want to discuss something that he associates with shame. \n\nBut here's a catch: he's 19, and she's 17. There might be legal considerations too, but the main issue here is about privacy versus transparency. The girl might feel that knowing the exact times helps her feel more secure, but the guy's right to privacy in his personal habits is also important. \n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe he can tell her generally that he watches porn during the week without specific times, which might make her feel informed enough without violating his privacy. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. \n\nAnother angle is about mutual respect. If the girl's request is causing him significant discomfort, maybe she needs to reconsider how she approaches the topic. But if the request is reasonable and part of building trust, he might need to find a way to accommodate her without feeling shamed. \n\nI think the key here is whether the girl's request is reasonable and if the guy's refusal is causing unnecessary harm. If he's being honest about his actions in a way that maintains trust without the specific timing, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girl's anxiety stems from a lack of trust, then the guy's refusal might be seen as not fully addressing her concerns. \n\nSo, balancing both perspectives, maybe the guy isn't entirely in the wrong because his feelings are valid, but he could be more open to finding a compromise. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately, I think the answer leans towards B, No, because his discomfort is valid and the request might be too intrusive.\n"
