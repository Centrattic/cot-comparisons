We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a couple for a year, only see each other on weekends. He studies in another city, and during the week he watches porn. She's okay with it now but wants him to inform her while he's doing it. He's uncomfortable and feels it's a private thing he does for relief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're in a long-distance situation part of the time, which can make communication more challenging. The girlfriend wants to know in real-time, which she says helps her feel calmer. But the author isn't comfortable with that and thinks it's something he should do alone.\n\nIs it reasonable for him to feel this way? Well, watching porn is a common behavior for many people, and the desire for privacy is understandable. However, in a relationship, transparency and communication are important. The girlfriend's request might come from a place of insecurity or wanting to feel involved even when they're apart. \n\nBut should the author have to inform her immediately after? The key here is mutual respect and boundaries. If the girlfriend is okay with him watching porn but just wants to know when, maybe there's a compromise. However, the author's discomfort is also valid. Ashaming himself for it might not be healthy, but withholding information could affect trust. \n\nI think it depends on their agreement. If they had a previous discussion where she accepted it, but now she's changing the terms, that might be a point of contention. The author might not be in the wrong if he hasn't agreed to that level of transparency. But if their communication was supposed to be open, then not sharing could be an issue. \n\nAlso, the age difference is 2, which isn't huge, but since she's 17 and he's 19, they're both young. Maybe her request is a bit naive or based on her own feelings of control. The author's right to privacy versus her need for reassurance. It's a balance. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, many people might find the girlfriend's request unusual, but in a trusting relationship, some level of openness is expected. The author's reasoning is about personal boundaries and not wanting to share intimate details in real-time. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think not necessarily. If they had a mutual agreement before, and she's now adding a new condition without considering his comfort, that's a problem. But if they haven't set clear boundaries, then maybe there's room for discussion. The answer would be B, No, because personal boundaries and privacy are important, and the author's discomfort is valid. The girlfriend's request is about her feelings, but the author isn't obligated to share that detail in real-time if it causes him shame. They need to find a compromise that respects both their needs.\n"
