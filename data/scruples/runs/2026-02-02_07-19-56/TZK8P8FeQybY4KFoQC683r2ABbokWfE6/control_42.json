We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the guy is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nHe's 19 and in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They see each other on weekends, and he studies in a different city during the week. He watches porn, which she accepts but dislikes. Now she wants him to tell her exactly when he watches it, while doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable with that and wants to keep it private, just a quick release. He's asking if he's unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about this.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend feels that knowing when he watches porn calms her. She's asking for transparency to ease her anxiety. On the other hand, the guy feels that this request makes him uncomfortable and ashamed. He wants to keep this part of his life private. \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's need for reassurance is valid, especially if she's feeling insecure. However, the guy's right to privacy and comfort is also important. The question is whether he's being unreasonable. \n\nThe fact that they're in a long-distance situation might add to the dynamics. She might feel more anxious because they don't see each other often, so she's seeking connection. But he's in a different city, so maybe the timing isn't even an issue except for her emotional need. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe he could tell her after the fact without being forced to disclose in real-time. But the problem is, he's refusing even to tell her after the fact. He's not sharing when he does it, which might be why she's pushing for immediate disclosure. \n\nThe law in some places might have issues with the age of consent, but since he's 19 and she's 17, that could be a red flag. Wait, if he's in the US, the age of consent varies by state, but in many places, 17 might be okay if she's close to 18. But maybe that's a separate issue. The main question here is about the porn disclosure.\n\nSo, the core issue is about trust and communication. If she wants more transparency, but he feels it's a privacy invasion, is he wrong? Or is she overstepping?\n\nIn many relationships, partners have different levels of comfort with sharing such details. If he's honest about his feelings and they can find a compromise, that's ideal. But right now, he's refusing to tell her even after the fact. That could lead to her feeling neglected or not trusted, which might cause conflict. However, if he's uncomfortable, it's also his right to set boundaries.\n\nBut if he's being dishonest about it even after the fact, that's a different issue. If he's hiding it, maybe she's not feeling respected. However, if he's open about it after, but not during, that's a different scenario. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not telling her immediately after.\n\nI think it's a matter of mutual respect. If she's asking for immediate communication and he can't do it, he's in his right to say no, but he might need to explain why and find a way to make her feel secure. But is he in the wrong? Maybe not if he's respectful in his refusal and communicates his boundaries. However, if he's being dishonest or not trying to meet her needs, then yes. But the situation here is that he's not telling her when he does it, which might be making her feel worse. So, is his refusal unreasonable?\n\nIn some cases, partners need to adjust for each other's comfort. If she's genuinely anxious, maybe he could consider telling her after the fact, even if it's not during. But he doesn't want to. So the question is whether his stance is unreasonable. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But given that she's asking for reassurance, and he's not providing any information, maybe he's being a bit unreasonable. However, if he's not harming her and just wants privacy, he's not in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal norms. But in general, if both are honest and respectful, there's a way to find a compromise. If he's being closed off, that could be a problem. \n\nSo, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) if he's being honest about his feelings and setting boundaries. But if he's being dishonest, then it's different. The scenario says he's not telling her when he does it, which is part of the problem. If he's not even telling her after, then he's not being transparent, which might be the issue. So maybe he is being unreasonable. But I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
