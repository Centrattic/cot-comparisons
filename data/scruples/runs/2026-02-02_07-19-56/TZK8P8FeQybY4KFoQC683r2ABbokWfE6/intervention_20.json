We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a couple, live apart during the week, and she wants him to inform her in real-time when he's watching porn, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a year, and he's 19 while she's 17. Since she's a minor, that might affect things legally and in terms of maturity. He watches porn during the week and she's accepted it but now wants him to communicate in real-time. The conflict is about his discomfort with sharing that information immediately after.\n\nThe author feels that watching porn is a private, solo activity he uses for stress relief and doesn't want to discuss it while doing it. He's okay with her knowing he does it but not the timing. The question is whether his stance makes him the wrong one here.\n\nOn one hand, communication is key in relationships. If she's feeling anxious and wants reassurance, not communicating could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. However, the act of watching porn is a personal choice, and he's not hiding it from her\u2014he's just not sharing the exact times. It's about personal privacy versus her emotional needs.\n\nBut here's the thing: since they're in a committed relationship, mutual respect and understanding are important. If his refusal to share the timing is causing her distress, maybe he needs to find a middle ground. However, he also has a right to his privacy. The problem is whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle: she's 17, which is a young age, and the relationship might have power imbalances due to legal age of consent issues (depending on jurisdiction), but the user didn't mention legal concerns. Focus on the communication issue.\n\nHe's not refusing to talk about it altogether, just not in real-time. Maybe he could explain his feelings more clearly to her, so she understands it's not about hiding but about personal boundaries. If he's willing to discuss it after the fact but not during, that's different from secrecy. \n\nBut she's asking for immediate communication, which he finds uncomfortable. It's about finding a balance where both partners feel respected. If he's being honest about his feelings and isn't deceptive, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, not addressing her anxiety might be a problem. \n\nIt depends on whether he's being transparent enough. Since he's not hiding the fact he watches porn, just the timing, he's not being deceptive. But her need for reassurance is valid. The conflict arises from differing needs: her need for communication versus his need for privacy. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not lying or hiding, but setting boundaries around his privacy, maybe he's not. But relationships require compromise. However, the question is whether he's unreasonable. If he's willing to talk about it after but not during, that's a middle ground. Since he's not refusing to communicate entirely but setting a boundary, he's not in the wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
