We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The scenario is that they're in a one-year relationship, and he's 19 while she's 17. They only see each other on weekends, and he's in another city during the week. She wants him to inform her whenever he watches porn, but he feels ashamed and wants privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since the girlfriend is 17, and the author is 19, there might be age of consent issues depending on the jurisdiction. But the question here is more about the relationship dynamics rather than legality. \n\nIn terms of the relationship, communication is key. The girlfriend is asking for transparency because it helps her feel calmer. The author, however, feels uncomfortable and wants to keep it private. Both have valid perspectives. The girlfriend might be dealing with jealousy or insecurity, and wants to feel included in the conversation. The author's discomfort is also understandable, as watching porn is a personal activity that many people might not want to share in the moment. \n\nI should also think about mutual respect and boundaries. The author has a right to privacy, but the girlfriend's needs should also be considered. The fact that she's grown to accept it shows she's trying to be understanding. But forcing him to share the exact time he watches it might cross a boundary he's not willing to set. \n\nOther guys might feel the same way about wanting privacy, but it's also a matter of what both partners are comfortable with. The author isn't being dishonest if he tells her he watches porn, just not the specific times. The main issue is the immediacy of sharing. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? It depends on whether they've discussed and agreed on this. If she's suddenly imposing a new boundary without prior discussion, maybe. But if they've had this conversation before and he's not budging, it's about respecting mutual boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because both parties have valid reasons, and the author's discomfort is a personal boundary that should be respected unless it's causing harm or dishonesty beyond just not sharing exact times.\n"
