We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a one-year relationship, see each other only on weekends, and he studies in a different city. He watches porn during the week, which she dislikes but has accepted. Now she wants him to inform her in real-time when he does it, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend wants transparency to feel secure, which is understandable. But the author feels that sharing this immediately after or during is embarrassing and makes him uncomfortable. He wants it to be a private, solitary activity for stress relief. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the girlfriend's request for immediate communication might stem from insecurity or trust issues. If he refuses, it could make her feel neglected or not respected. On the other hand, the author's privacy and comfort are also valid. Watching porn is a common activity, but the timing and context matter. \n\nIs it reasonable for her to ask for real-time updates? Maybe she feels left out or anxious if she's not involved. But does that make the author wrong for not complying? If he's not being secretive about his habits overall, just not the exact timing, is that a fair middle ground? The fact that he's already informed her about watching porn and she's accepted it suggests some level of mutual understanding. However, the specific request for immediate communication might push his boundaries too far. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being unreasonable. If both parties have agreed on certain terms and the girlfriend is now changing the rules without considering his feelings, that might be where the issue lies. The author's right to privacy and personal boundaries should be respected, especially if the behavior isn't harming the relationship otherwise. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust. If she's asking for this to feel secure, maybe there's an underlying issue in the relationship that needs addressing beyond just the porn. The author's refusal could be seen as a lack of willingness to meet her emotional needs, which might be a problem. However, forcing him to disclose in real-time might infringe on his personal space. \n\nI think it's a balance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's already being honest about his habits and the issue is about the method of communication. His discomfort is valid, and she might need to find another way to address her anxiety without requiring immediate disclosure. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. However, the question is binary, so based on the information given, the author's stance seems reasonable given his reasons for discomfort and the existing acceptance of the behavior.\n"
