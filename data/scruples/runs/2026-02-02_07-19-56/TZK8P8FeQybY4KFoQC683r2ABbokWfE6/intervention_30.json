We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend wants the guy to tell her when he watches porn, and he's uncomfortable with that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The girlfriend is seeking reassurance and wants to be informed in real-time. The guy feels ashamed and wants privacy. They have different needs here. The girlfriend's request is about communication and emotional comfort, while the guy's stance is about personal privacy and feeling embarrassed.\n\nI remember that in relationships, communication is key. However, respecting each other's boundaries is also important. The guy is being honest about his feelings, but the girlfriend's need for reassurance is valid too. The problem is whether his refusal to comply with her request is unreasonable.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, some people might find it hard to discuss sexual habits even if they're consensual. But the girlfriend's request is about being part of the communication process, not necessarily controlling his actions. It's a balance between respecting her feelings and his privacy.\n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the guy could tell her a few minutes after the fact, rather than in real-time. That might address her need for transparency without making him uncomfortable. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to do it immediately.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and understanding. If the guy is honest about his reasons and they can find a compromise, that's ideal. However, if he refuses without considering her feelings, that could be seen as not being in the right. But if he's open to negotiation and they can find another solution, maybe not. The answer depends on whether there's a willingness to meet halfway.\n\nIn the absence of coercion or harm, personal boundaries are important. The guy's discomfort is real, but the girlfriend's anxiety is also valid. The wrong here might not be clear-cut. The author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to communicate his feelings and they're seeking a compromise. However, if he's being dismissive of her needs, that's different.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there's an attempt to find a solution that respects both parties. If the author is just refusing without discussion, he might be in the wrong. But if he's trying to find a middle ground, then he's not. The original question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) if he's being honest and it's a matter of differing needs. But if he's disregarding her feelings entirely, then A. Since the scenario shows he's trying to explain his side, maybe B is more appropriate.\n"
