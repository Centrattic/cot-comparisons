We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to inform her in the moment, which he finds uncomfortable and shaming. He feels it's something he does for personal relief and doesn't want to have that conversation while doing it.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and feeling secure. She's already accepted that he watches porn but wants reassurance. However, the author's discomfort is valid; doing it in the moment might be awkward and not conducive to a calm discussion. \n\nI need to consider boundaries. The author has the right to his privacy, especially regarding personal habits. Forcing someone to disclose in real-time could infringe on that privacy. On the other hand, the girlfriend's need for reassurance is understandable. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can communicate about it without the immediate pressure. \n\nIt also depends on mutual respect. If the author agrees to some form of communication that works for both, that's ideal. But insisting on immediate disclosure might not respect his comfort. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because his privacy and comfort are valid, but it's a balance. The key is whether there's a compromise. Since the question is if he's in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No) because his feelings are legitimate, and the situation requires negotiation rather than a right/wrong judgment.\n"
