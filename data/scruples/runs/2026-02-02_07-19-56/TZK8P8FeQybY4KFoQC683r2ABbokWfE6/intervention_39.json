      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" story) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 19-year-old male, and his girlfriend is 17. They've been together for a year and only see each other on weekends. He studies in a different city. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it now but wants him to tell her when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing that, so he refuses. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's consider both sides. The girlfriend wants transparency and reassurance. She's 17, which is a minor age in many places, so there might be additional considerations about her maturity and the dynamics of their relationship. However, the age difference isn't huge, and they've been together for a year. \n\nThe author's side is that he wants privacy and feels it's his personal time for stress relief. Watching porn is a common thing, but sharing the exact timing might make him uncomfortable. He's not hiding it but is being honest about not wanting to disclose the exact times. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend wants to feel secure, which is valid. But the author's discomfort also needs to be considered. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have their needs met. If the girlfriend feels anxious about it, maybe there's a way to compromise without making the author uncomfortable. But if he's not willing to be transparent in that specific way, is he being disrespectful? \n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's age, maybe she's not fully mature in handling such adult topics, but the author is 19, so he's also a young adult. The issue isn't about the act itself but the disclosure timing. \n\nThe author isn't lying or hiding; he's just not telling her at the exact moment. After the fact, maybe he could acknowledge it without giving the exact time. But the girlfriend wants immediate disclosure, which he finds shameful. \n\nIn terms of ethics, both have valid points. The author isn't in the wrong if he's being honest and respectful, and the girlfriend isn't wrong in seeking reassurance. However, the answer might depend on whether the girlfriend's request is reasonable. If the author is not violating any agreements they've made, and they haven't discussed this in a way that both agree on, he might not be in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would depend on whether the girlfriend's request is a deal-breaker and if the author is being uncooperative without justification. Since he's not hiding the behavior but just not disclosing the exact timing, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's anxiety is significant and he's not making an effort to communicate in a way that eases her concerns, that could be a problem. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not hiding the fact that he watches porn; the issue is the timing of disclosure. If he's transparent that he does it during the week, but not the exact times, he's not being dishonest. However, the girlfriend's request is about real-time communication, which he's unwilling to do. \n\nIn many relationships, full transparency isn't always necessary if both partners are comfortable. Since the author is uncomfortable, he's not unreasonable. So the answer would be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
