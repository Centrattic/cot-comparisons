We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation involves a 19-year-old male in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girl. They see each other only on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. The girlfriend wants him to inform her in real-time when he does this, but he finds it uncomfortable and wants privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Since they're in a committed relationship, communication is key. However, the girlfriend's request is about real-time disclosure, which might be a boundary issue for the author. He feels ashamed and wants privacy, which is understandable as porn use is a personal activity that many people prefer to keep private.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. She's 17, which is under 18, and depending on the jurisdiction, this could touch on legal issues regarding consent in relationships. However, the main question here is about the moral or relational aspect. She's seeking reassurance, which is important in relationships to build trust. Her request might stem from insecurity or fear of being replaced or neglected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's discomfort is real. Watching porn is a common behavior, but sharing it in real-time could be seen as intrusive. It's about mutual respect of boundaries. The girlfriend's request might be reasonable in her eyes, but the author has the right to privacy. The challenge is finding a middle ground where both feel respected.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's refusal is \"unreasonable.\" In relationships, compromise is necessary. If the author refuses entirely without discussion, that could be problematic. However, if he's open to discussing alternatives, like informing her after the fact or setting agreed-upon terms, that might be a better approach. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not complying with the request as stated. Since he's not agreeing to her terms, but has valid reasons, it's a matter of balancing both parties' needs.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't clear-cut. However, since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is seeking validation, I need to assess if his stance is justified. Given that privacy is a personal right and the girlfriend's request is specific and potentially uncomfortable for him, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The right answer would be B (he's not in the wrong), but I should ensure that both perspectives are considered.\n"
