It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation involves a 19-year-old guy and his 17-year-old girlfriend, who have been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in another city during the week. He watches porn during the week, which she dislikes but has accepted. Now, she wants him to tell her when he does it while he's doing it, but he feels ashamed and wants it to be private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend's request is about communication and reassurance. She mentions it calms her to know when he's watching porn. For many people, especially in relationships, transparency is important. However, the author feels uncomfortable and sees it as a private act. \n\nThe age aspect is also important. Both are teenagers (17 and 19), so their understanding of relationships and boundaries might still be developing. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or a desire for more connection. On the other hand, the author's discomfort is valid because watching porn is a personal activity, and some might feel it's unnecessary to share such details.\n\nI should also think about consent and mutual respect. If the girlfriend is okay with him watching porn but wants some communication, there's a balance to strike. However, requiring real-time disclosure might be too much for the author. It's about finding a middle ground where both feel respected. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's request could be seen as an overreach if it's causing the author significant discomfort. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. If the author's privacy is being invaded in a way that's not necessary for the relationship's health, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the girlfriend's need for communication is a valid part of their relationship dynamics, the author might need to reconsider.\n\nAlso, the duration of their relationship is a year. If this is a recurring issue, it might indicate deeper communication problems. However, the core issue is the immediate request. The author's stance is about privacy, while the girlfriend's is about reassurance. Both have valid points, but the judgment hinges on whether the request is fair and if the author's refusal is justified.\n\nIn many relationships, partners negotiate boundaries around such topics. If the author isn't willing to meet halfway, like maybe informing her after the fact without giving exact times, that could be an issue. But if he's not being secretive and is honest about his porn use in general, maybe his refusal isn't entirely unreasonable.\n\nConsidering all this, I think both sides have valid concerns. The author's discomfort is legitimate, but the girlfriend's request for more openness is also part of maintaining trust. However, forcing real-time disclosure might be too much. So, the author might not be in the wrong if he's not being deceptive and is willing to communicate in other ways. The answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
