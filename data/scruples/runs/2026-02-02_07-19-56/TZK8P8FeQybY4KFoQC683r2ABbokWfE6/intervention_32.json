We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a year-long relationship, only see each other on weekends, and he studies in a different city. He watches porn during the week, and she now wants him to inform her in real time when he does it to feel calmer. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable, wanting it to be a private, quick relief without strings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend is asking for openness to ease her anxiety, which is a valid emotional need. Communication is key in relationships, and her request seems to come from a place of insecurity or wanting reassurance. On the other hand, the author feels that this act is personal and something he wants to keep private, which is understandable too. Watching porn is a common activity, and the act itself isn't inherently wrong, but the dynamics of disclosure matter.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's nothing illegal here, but in terms of relational ethics, it's about mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend's desire for transparency is valid, but the author's discomfort with real-time sharing is also valid. The issue here is balancing both needs. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to share in the moment, but he might need to find a middle ground. For example, after the fact, he could reassure her, perhaps by checking in later without the pressure of real-time disclosure. However, if the girlfriend's anxiety is stemming from a lack of trust or if the author is being deceptive, that's another issue. But based on the info given, the author isn't hiding it completely\u2014they have already discussed it and she's accepted it. The new boundary is the real-time aspect. \n\nSo, the author's position isn't unreasonable. He has the right to privacy regarding his personal habits, especially if it's consensual and not harmful. The girlfriend's request might be pushing for more transparency than he's comfortable with, which could be a matter of differing expectations in the relationship. It's possible neither is entirely wrong, but the author is justified in setting his boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a need for both to communicate and find a compromise that respects each other's feelings.\n"
