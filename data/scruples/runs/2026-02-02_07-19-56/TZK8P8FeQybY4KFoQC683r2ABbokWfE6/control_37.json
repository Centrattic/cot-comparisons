      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the guy is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. They've been in a relationship for a year, and he's 19 while she's 17. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in another city during the week.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about transparency in the relationship. The girlfriend wants to know when he watches porn, specifically while he's doing it, to feel more at ease. He's uncomfortable with that and doesn't agree, arguing that he wants to keep it private as it's a personal habit he does alone for stress relief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect in a relationship. Open communication is key, so if the girlfriend feels that knowing would help her feel secure, that's a valid concern. However, the guy's feelings of shame and discomfort are also important. It's about finding a balance where both partners feel respected and heard.\n\nThe age difference is 17 and 19, which is a two-year gap. Legally, if she's 17 and he's 19, depending on the jurisdiction, there might be some legal considerations, but the question here is more about the moral aspect of sharing personal habits.\n\nHe mentions that she's accepted his porn-watching habit but now wants more information. The question is whether he's wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately after. The key points here are about privacy versus transparency. The girlfriend's need for reassurance is understandable, but the guy's right to privacy in this aspect should also be considered.\n\nIn some relationships, partners may have different boundaries regarding such topics. The fact that he's using porn for stress relief and it's not attached to anything else might be a factor. If there's no deceit beyond the initial honesty about the habit, then his reluctance to share exact timings might not be wrong. However, if the lack of communication is causing her distress, then there's a need for compromise.\n\nBut the problem here is that she wants to know during the act, which is a very specific request. That could be seen as intrusive, given that watching porn is a personal activity. The guy's discomfort with being observed or having to report in real-time is valid. It's important to recognize that everyone has different comfort levels regarding privacy in relationships.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The girlfriend is asking for something that makes him uncomfortable, and he's asserting his boundaries. While she has a right to feel secure, he also has a right to his privacy. The key is whether there's mutual respect in their communication. If they're both trying to understand each other's perspectives, then neither is entirely wrong. But if one is being overly demanding without considering the other's feelings, that's a problem.\n\nIn summary, the guy's reluctance to share exact times isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's causing him shame. However, if the lack of communication is leading to her anxiety, then they might need to find a middle ground. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it seems like his stance is not wrong because he's setting a boundary based on his comfort, even if it's not meeting her needs. But ideally, couples should work on finding a solution that respects both parties' needs without either being in the wrong.\n"
