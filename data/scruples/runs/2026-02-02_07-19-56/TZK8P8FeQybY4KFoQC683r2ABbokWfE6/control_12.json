We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants to know in real-time, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. They're 19 and 17, a year into the relationship, and only see each other on weekends. He studies far away, so their time is limited. He watches porn during the week, which she's accepted but still dislikes. Now she wants him to inform her while doing it, which he finds uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries. The girlfriend is asking for transparency to feel reassured, which is a valid need. However, the author feels that this request makes him uncomfortable and ashamed. It's important to note that both parties have the right to their feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. The girlfriend's request might come from a place of needing more connection or security. However, the author's discomfort is also valid because being present during an activity he finds shameful could cause emotional distress. \n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. For example, maybe he can communicate after the fact without having to do it in real-time. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for not complying with her current request. \n\nSince the situation involves differing needs and neither side is clearly violating each other's boundaries, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't lying or hiding; he's setting his own boundaries. The girlfriend's request is about her emotional needs, which are important, but the author's feelings of shame must also be respected. \n\nTherefore, the answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because both have valid perspectives, and the issue is about finding a compromise rather than one party being at fault.\n"
