We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to inform her while he's doing it, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful. He feels it's just a private thing he does for stress relief and doesn't want to discuss it immediately after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl is 17, so she's a minor in most places, but the relationship is a year long. The guy is 19. Their situation is that they only see each other on weekends, so during the week he's apart and watches porn. The girl's issue is about trust and reassurance. She wants to know when he does it, which he says he does in a non-attached way. \n\nThe guy's reasoning is privacy and feeling ashamed. He wants it to be a private moment, something he does alone. He's uncomfortable with her knowing in real-time. The question is whether his position is unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girl is expressing a need for reassurance, which might stem from insecurity or wanting to feel involved. However, the guy's discomfort is valid. Watching porn is a personal habit, and the expectation to share it in real-time might be excessive. \n\nBut does that make him in the wrong? Maybe not. The problem here is mutual misunderstanding. Both have valid points: the girl needs some level of communication, but the guy's privacy is important. However, the way he's handling it is not sharing at all. Maybe a middle ground, like discussing it after and being honest without the real-time aspect, could work. \n\nBut the question is whether he's wrong. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and what's agreed upon. The girl's request is specific to knowing while he does it, which he refuses. If he's not deceitful and is honest about it post-facto, maybe that's acceptable. But if the girl feels the real-time communication is necessary for their trust, then the guy's refusal could be seen as not respecting her feelings, making him partially at fault. \n\nHowever, the core issue is that the guy feels ashamed, which might be a deeper problem. If he's using porn in a way that's causing him shame, maybe that's something to address. But the question is about the immediate issue of disclosure timing. \n\nIn many relationships, partners have different boundaries. As long as both are honest and respectful, even if they don't meet each other's needs perfectly, it's not necessarily wrong. The guy isn't hiding it entirely; he's just not meeting her specific request. If the girl's request is unreasonable, then he's not in the wrong. But if her request is about trust and he's not respecting her need for that, then he might be. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because his discomfort is valid, and the girl's request is specific. However, there's room for discussion and compromise. The guy isn't being deceitful; he's just not meeting her exact request, which might not be fair, but it's not entirely his fault either. So, B.\n"
