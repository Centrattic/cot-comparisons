We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the guy is in a relationship with his girlfriend, they're 19 and 17 respectively. They're in a year-long relationship but only see each other on the weekends. He's in a different city for studying. He watches porn during the week, and she's okay with it but wants him to tell her exactly when he does it. He's uncomfortable with that and doesn't want to tell her immediately after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl wants transparency because it calms her down. That makes sense; she might feel insecure or worried about his activities when they're not together. On the other hand, the guy feels that watching porn is a private act, something he does for himself, and he's ashamed to discuss it. He wants to move on from it quickly without having to explain or talk about it right away.\n\nNow, is the guy in the wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. The girl is expressing her need for reassurance, which is valid. However, the guy has his own feelings of discomfort and shame. But maybe he should be more understanding of her emotions. However, forcing someone to share something they find embarrassing might not be fair either. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs.\n\nThe girl's request might be about trust and feeling included. If they've agreed on an open relationship where porn is accepted, maybe she just needs some confirmation to feel secure. The guy's resistance is about his personal boundaries. It's possible that there's a compromise here, like setting a time when they can discuss it without interrupting the act itself. For example, maybe he could tell her the next day instead of right after. But he's not willing to do even that.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. If he's agreed not to hide it but she wants more transparency, maybe he's being unreasonable. However, if he's already being honest about watching porn and just not the timing, maybe it's about his comfort. The core issue is mutual respect and understanding. If the girl's need for reassurance is causing stress, maybe there's an underlying issue in the relationship that needs addressing beyond just the porn.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the guy is being dishonest or withholding information that the girl is entitled to know. If they've already discussed the fact that he watches porn and she's accepted it, the immediate timing might not be as crucial. However, if she's feeling anxious and needs that reassurance, then maybe the guy should find a way to accommodate her without feeling forced into a situation that makes him uncomfortable. But since he's not willing to even discuss it after the fact, that might be where the problem lies. So maybe he's in the wrong for not being flexible enough in their communication. Alternatively, maybe she's overreaching. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the guy not being in the wrong because his privacy and comfort matter too. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. Given that, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
