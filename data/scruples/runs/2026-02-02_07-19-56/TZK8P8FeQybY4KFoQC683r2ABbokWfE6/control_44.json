We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple dealing with the girlfriend wanting to know when her partner watches porn, and the guy doesn't want to tell her immediately. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their communication. The girlfriend says it calms her to know when he does it, so she's probably seeking reassurance or a way to feel more connected. The guy feels ashamed and uncomfortable, wanting to keep it private. That's a common feeling, as porn use is often a personal matter people don't discuss openly.\n\nNow, the girlfriend is 17 and they've been together for a year, but there's an age gap since the guy is 19. Age of consent laws vary, but in most places, 17 is close to 18, so it's probably legal. Still, the relationship's power dynamics and maturity levels might be a factor here. However, the main issue isn't about the legality but the communication around porn use.\n\nThe guy's argument is about privacy and feeling embarrassed. It's reasonable for someone to want to keep certain personal activities private, especially when it comes to something like porn. However, the girlfriend's request is about communication and trust. She might be trying to build a sense of openness and honesty in the relationship. The problem here is balancing these two needs: his need for privacy vs. her need for reassurance.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If one partner is uncomfortable with a request, it's important to find a middle ground. The guy might not need to tell her in the moment, but maybe after the fact, or set some boundaries. The girlfriend asking for immediate disclosure might be too much for him, given his feelings of shame. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her immediately. If the girlfriend is insistent and he isn't budging without discussion, maybe there's a lack of compromise. But if they haven't found a solution that works for both, it's a mutual issue. However, the key point is that he's not being disrespectful or harmful by not complying with her request, as it's about his personal boundaries. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B."
