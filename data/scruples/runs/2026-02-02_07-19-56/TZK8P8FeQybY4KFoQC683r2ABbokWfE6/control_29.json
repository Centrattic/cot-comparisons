We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a couple who only sees each other on weekends, and he watches porn during the week. She wants him to tell her while he's doing it, but he feels ashamed and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is 17, so she's a minor in many places. That might affect the relationship's legality and the nature of their communication. But the main issue here is about transparency around his porn use. \n\nHe says she's accepted it but still dislikes it. Now she's asking for immediate disclosure. The author feels uncomfortable because it's a private act, and he doesn't want to discuss it at the time. He wants to move on after. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. However, the age difference and her being a minor might mean that she's less experienced and might have higher anxiety about his behavior. But the author's discomfort about sharing such a personal act in real-time is understandable. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? Well, he's not hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's just not disclosing the exact times. He's willing to discuss it after, but not during. Since she's 17, maybe she's not in a position to demand such immediate disclosure, especially if he's already being open about it post-hoc. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's 19 and she's 17 might complicate things, but that's more about the legality. The question is about whether he's wrong in this specific situation. \n\nFrom a general perspective, if the couple agreed on a level of communication, and the author is meeting those terms (like telling after), maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if she's asking for more transparency due to her anxiety, he could be expected to find a middle ground. But he's stating that the immediate disclosure makes him uncomfortable, which is his valid feeling. \n\nSo, considering that he's not hiding the fact entirely and is willing to discuss it after, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the girlfriend's request is reasonable and he's refusing without a good reason, then maybe A. But given his reasons, it's more of a personal boundary issue. So B seems correct.\n"
