      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is 19, his girlfriend is 17, and they've been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends because he's in a different city studying. He watches porn during the week, which she initially disliked but has accepted. Now she wants him to tell her when he does it, while he's doing it, just so she feels more at ease. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing that because he wants it to be private and just a quick release for him.\n\nThe question is whether he's being unreasonable. Let's think about communication in relationships. Open communication is usually key. She wants reassurance, maybe to feel secure in the relationship. If she's uncomfortable with his porn use, even though she's accepted it, needing to know the timing could be her way of managing her anxiety. But the author feels that it's his private activity and shouldn't have to share the exact moments.\n\nBut then again, consent and mutual agreement on boundaries are important. If they have a conversation where she feels her needs are valid, and he respects that, maybe he should consider her perspective. However, if he's not comfortable sharing that specific information, there's a balance between respecting her need for reassurance and his privacy.\n\nSome might argue that if he's not cheating or doing anything harmful, why the secrecy? But others might say everyone has different boundaries, and if she's accepted his porn use, she might just want more transparency. The fact that he's not in the same city might mean she feels more insecure because they're not together often, so needing to know could be a way to feel involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the act of watching porn is a personal choice, and he might feel that being forced to disclose the exact time is invasive. There's a line between communication and privacy. If he's honest about his feelings without being dismissive, maybe there's a middle ground, like setting a time when they can talk about it without being in the moment, but that's not what she wants.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not being dishonest about watching porn and she's already accepted that, maybe not. But if his refusal to communicate the timing is causing her distress and he's not trying to find a compromise, that could be problematic. However, the key here is whether his refusal is reasonable. Since he feels it's uncomfortable and he's not hiding the fact that he does it, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But maybe he should try to understand her perspective better and see if there's another way to meet her needs without him having to disclose in the moment.\n\nI think the answer depends on their communication. If they can find a solution that makes both feel respected, then neither is entirely wrong. But in this case, the author is asking if he's unreasonable. Since he's sharing that he feels ashamed and uncomfortable, and the act itself isn't harmful, I might lean towards B, he's not in the wrong. But there's a valid argument for both sides. However, the fact that she's 17 and he's 19, and considering age of consent laws, but since they're in a relationship, that's probably not the issue here. The main issue is communication and mutual respect. He's honest about his habits, she's expressing her need for reassurance. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, maybe that's the problem. But if he's not being honest or if he's hiding it, that's different. Here, he's not hiding it, just the timing. So maybe B is the right answer.\n"
