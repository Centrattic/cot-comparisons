We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend when he watches porn. The situation is that they've been together a year, live apart during the week, and he watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to tell her while he's doing it, but he feels ashamed and doesn't want to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any relationship. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and reassurance. She might feel insecure or want to be included in his life more. On the other hand, the author feels uncomfortable sharing that specific moment. It's a privacy issue for him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's about mutual respect. The girlfriend's feelings matter, but so does his comfort. If both are valid, maybe the problem is about finding a middle ground. But the question is whether he's wrong. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, maybe he is being unreasonable. However, if his reasons are genuine discomfort and not deceit, maybe not. \n\nAlso, considering the age gap\u201419 and 17. Legally, they're both adults, but maybe there's a maturity difference. The girlfriend might be seeking more involvement in the relationship, and not communicating might be seen as a lack of trust. But the author's discomfort is real. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. If he's not willing to adjust at all, that could be an issue. But if she's asking for something that makes him uncomfortable, maybe she's overstepping. However, since they live apart and see each other only on weekends, maybe his privacy is more important. \n\nSo, the answer is subjective. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not hiding it, just not sharing the immediate details, and his discomfort is valid, maybe he's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
