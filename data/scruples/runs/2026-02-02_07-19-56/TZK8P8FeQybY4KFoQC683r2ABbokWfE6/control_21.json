It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're a 19M and 17F couple with a year of being together, and they only see each other on weekends. He watches porn during the week and she wants him to tell her when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is 17, so she's a minor in many places, but since the relationship is a year old, maybe they're in a place where the age of consent is lower. But that's not directly relevant here. The main issue is about communication and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nShe wants to know when he watches porn, while he feels it's private and wants to keep it to himself. The key points here are mutual respect and the terms of the relationship. In healthy relationships, both partners should have a say in what they're comfortable with. However, there's a balance between respecting each other's needs and maintaining one's privacy.\n\nThe author's discomfort is valid. Watching porn is a personal activity, and many people feel embarrassed discussing it, especially in real-time. On the other hand, the girlfriend's request for transparency could stem from feelings of insecurity or a desire for trust. But is the author unreasonable for not wanting to comply?\n\nIt depends on their agreement. If they've discussed boundaries and she's accepted that he watches porn but doesn't want to disclose the timing, then he's not in the wrong. However, if there was an implicit or explicit agreement to be more open, then he might be. The fact that she says she's grown to accept it suggests there was prior discussion. Her new request is a change, and the author has the right to decline if it makes him uncomfortable.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to find a middle ground. If she's feeling anxious, perhaps other forms of reassurance could be explored. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary here, especially if it's a personal matter he wishes to keep private. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
