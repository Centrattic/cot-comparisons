We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to inform her in real-time, which he finds uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They're 19 and 17, which is a legal age in many places, but there's a two-year age gap. Since they're in a one-year relationship and only see each other on weekends, communication might be tricky. The author watches porn during the week, and the girlfriend initially disapproves but has accepted it. Now she wants him to tell her while doing it, which he refuses because it makes him ashamed and uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and communication. The girlfriend's request seems to stem from a need for reassurance or control, but the author feels it invades his privacy. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's request might be about trust issues, but the author's discomfort is valid. However, the act of watching porn itself isn't inherently wrong, but transparency can be a mutual agreement. If the author is honest about his feelings without being evasive, and the girlfriend respects his need for privacy, that's a balance. But if the girlfriend feels neglected or untrusted, that's another issue.\n\nThe author isn't lying; he's not hiding the fact he watches porn, just the timing. He communicates it after the fact. The girlfriend's request for real-time updates might be excessive, but it's her way of coping. The author's discomfort is about the timing of disclosure. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. The author isn't in the wrong if he communicates the act but not the exact timing, especially if it causes him shame. However, if the girlfriend feels that this lack of real-time communication is a breach of trust, there might be deeper issues. But the immediate question is about the author's right to privacy versus the girlfriend's need for reassurance. \n\nGiven that the author is honest about his pornography use and the girlfriend has accepted it, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to share the exact timing. The request might be too much for him, and respecting his feelings is important. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
