We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. \n\nFirst, the situation: the couple has been together for a year. The guy is 19, the girl is 17. They only see each other on weekends, and during the week he's in a different city studying. He watches porn, which she dislikes but has accepted. Now she wants him to tell her when he does it, while doing it, to calm her. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable and just wants it to be a private, quick relief.\n\nSo, the main issue here is communication and boundaries in their relationship. The girl is seeking reassurance, maybe to feel more connected or to have some control over her anxiety. The guy is resisting because it makes him uncomfortable and he wants privacy.\n\nIn relationships, both partners have needs. The girl's need for communication is valid, but the guy's need for privacy and not wanting to share something that makes him self-conscious is also valid. The question is whether his refusal is unreasonable.\n\nThe key factors here might be mutual respect and understanding. If the girl's request is causing distress to him, then his refusal isn't unreasonable. On the other hand, if the girl's need for communication is part of building trust, there might be a compromise needed. However, since the guy is already disclosing that he watches porn (she knows about it, just not the exact times), he might not be in the wrong for not giving real-time updates. \n\nAlso, considering their age and the fact that they're in a long-distance situation, the dynamics might be different. The guy might need some space, and the girl might be struggling with insecurity. It's possible that the guy's feelings are valid because sharing that specific information could be more about her needing reassurance than him needing to share it. \n\nSo, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong, but there's room for them to find a middle ground. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and his reasons are about his comfort, the answer is probably B.\n"
