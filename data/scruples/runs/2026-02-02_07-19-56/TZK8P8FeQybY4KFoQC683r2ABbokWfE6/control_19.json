We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is a 19-year-old guy in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girl. They only see each other on weekends because he studies in another city. He watches porn during the week, which his girlfriend disapproves of but has come to accept. Now she wants him to tell her exactly when he's watching porn while he's doing it, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful. He's asking if he's unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend wants transparency to feel secure, which is reasonable. But the guy feels ashamed and wants privacy. The question is whether his reluctance is valid.\n\nPorn use is a personal choice, and the level of disclosure in a relationship can vary. The girlfriend's request is specific\u2014she wants to know in real-time. The guy's discomfort might stem from feeling exposed or judged. However, since they're a couple, openness is important. But at the same time, everyone has private habits. The key is mutual respect and boundaries.\n\nThe girl's age is 17, which is still young, and relationships can be complex at that age. Maybe she's trying to manage her anxiety through control. But the guy's privacy isn't being respected if he's forced to report immediately. However, if there's a mutual agreement on how much to disclose, that's better.\n\nHe's not hiding it entirely; he's just not giving real-time updates. That might not be wrong if both sides can agree on a compromise. The fact that she's accepted he watches porn but now wants more transparency might be a step too far for him. It's about finding a middle ground where both feel comfortable.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the agreement was that he tells her after, but she now wants more, maybe she's overstepping. But if he's being dishonest, that's different. Since he's not hiding the fact he watches porn, just the timing, it's more about privacy. Therefore, he might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
