We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple having a disagreement over whether the guy should tell his girlfriend in real-time when he's watching porn. The girlfriend wants to know immediately, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a year, and they're young\u201419 and 17. She's okay with him watching porn but wants to be informed as it happens. He's okay with her knowing he does it but doesn't want to tell her at the moment.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, communication in relationships is key. The girlfriend is expressing a need for reassurance, which might stem from insecurity or trust issues. If he's not willing to meet her halfway, it could lead to more problems. But on the other hand, the act of watching porn is a private, personal habit. Forcing someone to disclose in real-time might infringe on their privacy. \n\nBut wait, they already have an open conversation about it. She's accepted it but still wants to know immediately. He's uncomfortable with that. Maybe he's not in the wrong for feeling that way. However, if this is causing distress to her and he's not making an effort, that could be a problem. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a matter of mutual respect and boundaries. If they can't find a compromise, maybe there's an issue. But the author isn't hiding the fact he does it; he just doesn't want to tell her immediately. Since she's 17, maybe there are other factors, but the core issue is about the timing of disclosure. \n\nThe answer might depend on the level of respect for each other's feelings. The author isn't lying, just not sharing in real-time. So maybe he's not in the wrong. He's being honest but has a boundary. The girlfriend's need for immediate knowledge is her issue, but he's not violating any agreement they have. So answer B.\n"
