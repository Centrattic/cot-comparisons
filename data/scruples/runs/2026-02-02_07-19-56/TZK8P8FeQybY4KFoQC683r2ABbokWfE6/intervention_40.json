      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're a couple in a long-distance kind of setup since they see each other only on weekends. The guy is 19, she's 17. They've been dating for a year. He watches porn during the week, and while she initially dislikes it, she's come to accept it. Now she wants him to tell her in real-time when he's doing it, which he finds uncomfortable and embarrassing.\n\nThe guy's reasoning is that he wants it to be a private, quick release, and he doesn't want to talk about it right after. He feels ashamed and doesn't want to share that moment. The girl, on the other hand, says it calms her knowing when he does it. \n\nSo, the main issue here is about communication and boundaries in their relationship. The girl is seeking reassurance through transparency, while the guy values his privacy and feels that this act is personal. \n\nFrom a relational standpoint, communication is key. She's asking for something specific to feel more at ease. If he's not willing to comply, there's a potential for her to feel unheard or mistrusted. However, there's also the aspect of personal privacy and the right to have some autonomy in one's own habits, even in a relationship. \n\nBut wait, the girl is 17 and he's 19. The age difference might affect how they approach these discussions. Also, considering that they're in a long-distance situation, communication might be more critical for maintaining trust. If he's not being transparent, she might feel insecure or think he's hiding something else. \n\nHowever, the act of watching porn is a personal choice, and everyone has different comfort levels about discussing it. The key here is mutual respect. If she's uncomfortable with him not telling her, but he's equally uncomfortable sharing in real-time, they need to find a middle ground. \n\nThe author's stance is that he doesn't want to share it immediately. Is that unreasonable? If the couple hasn't established a mutual understanding, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if they've already had discussions and agreed on certain terms, then not following through might be an issue. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, both partners need to negotiate their comfort levels. If the girl feels that knowing in real-time is important for her peace of mind, then the guy's refusal could be seen as disregarding her needs. However, if the guy's privacy and comfort are also valid, then there's a balance to be struck. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether there was prior agreement. Since the girl is now changing the terms (from accepting it to wanting real-time updates), the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to comply if he hasn't agreed to that. But refusing without discussion might not be great. However, in this case, he's already expressed discomfort, so maybe he's justified in not wanting to do it. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because he's asserting his need for privacy and comfort, which is a valid personal boundary. However, it's important for them to communicate and find a solution that works for both. But in this specific scenario, he's not being unreasonable for not wanting to share in real-time.\n"
