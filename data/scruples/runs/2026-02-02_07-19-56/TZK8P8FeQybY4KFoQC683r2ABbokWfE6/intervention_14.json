We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (19M) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his 17-year-old girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. They've had a year-long relationship, and she wants him to inform her in real-time. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable about it, wanting to keep it private as it's for his personal stress relief.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend is 17, which is the age of majority in some places but not in others. However, the key issue here is about communication and boundaries. She's asking for transparency to feel at ease, which is understandable. But his discomfort is also valid\u2014he's asking for privacy for something that's a personal habit.\n\nThe question is whether he's being unreasonable. From a communication standpoint, not sharing information that's causing stress in the relationship could be a problem. However, the act of watching porn is a private matter, and many people do find it embarrassing to discuss. The fact that she's grown to accept it shows some level of compromise already.\n\nThe author's stance is about maintaining privacy for something he sees as a solitary activity. Others might argue that full transparency is necessary once a partner expresses discomfort. But others might see his position as reasonable, especially if the act isn't harmful and they're working on mutual understanding.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe they could agree on a compromise where he informs her after the fact but not in real-time, or sets boundaries that respect both their needs. The fact that he's seeking advice suggests he's trying to find a solution, which is positive.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some relationships require more openness, others less. The key is whether both parties feel respected. Since she's 17, there might be maturity differences, but the core issue is about mutual respect and consent in their communication preferences.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a nuanced situation. If he's being honest about his feelings and they're working on a compromise, perhaps not. But if his refusal is causing her ongoing distress without effort to understand her perspective, then maybe. The answer hinges on their communication and willingness to find a solution that works for both. Given the information, I think he's not in the wrong because he's trying to balance his need for privacy with her need for reassurance, and it's a common issue in relationships.\n"
