      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a one-year relationship, they only see each other on weekends, and he's studying in another city. She wants him to tell her when he does it, but he feels ashamed and uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is being unreasonable. The key points here are communication and boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend's request is about transparency and feeling secure. She says it calms her to know when he watches porn, which suggests she's seeking reassurance. On the other hand, the author feels that it's a private activity and doesn't want to discuss it immediately after.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is important. The author's discomfort is valid, but so is the girlfriend's need for reassurance. However, the question is whether the author is wrong for not complying with her request. If the agreement they had before was that he didn't have to tell her immediately, but now she's changing the terms, there's a need for compromise. However, if the author feels that sharing the exact times is too intrusive or makes him uncomfortable, he's not entirely at fault. But maybe he needs to find a middle ground, like agreeing to tell her after the fact without going into detail, or discussing how to address her anxiety without forcing him to share in the moment. The fact that he's open to discussion and trying to explain his feelings shows he's not being dismissive. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because both sides have valid feelings, but communication is key. The answer is B.\n"
