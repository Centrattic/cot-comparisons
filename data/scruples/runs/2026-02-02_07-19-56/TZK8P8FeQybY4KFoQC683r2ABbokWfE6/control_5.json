We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (19M) is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend (17F) exactly when he watches porn. They've been in a relationship for a year, and they only see each other on weekends. The girl wants him to inform her in real-time when he's watching porn during the week, which he finds uncomfortable and shameful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend's request is about communication and reassurance. She mentions it calms her to know when he's watching porn. That suggests she's seeking some level of transparency to feel secure. However, the author feels that this request invades his privacy and makes him uncomfortable. He wants to keep this activity as a private, stress-relieving act without involving her.\n\nNext, the age difference: the girl is 17, which is a minor in many jurisdictions, but the relationship duration is a year. However, the question isn't about the legality of the relationship but the specific issue of communication. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual respect, both partners have the right to express their boundaries. The author is not hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's just not sharing the exact timing. The girlfriend's request is for more detailed disclosure, which he's not comfortable with. \n\nIt's important to note that healthy relationships require negotiation of boundaries. If the author can explain his feelings without judgment and the girlfriend can adjust her request to something that works for both, that's ideal. But is he in the wrong? Well, he's not being deceptive by not telling her the exact times. He's being honest about his preference for privacy. The girlfriend's request is valid from her perspective, but the author's discomfort is also valid. \n\nSo, neither is entirely in the wrong. The key issue here is communication. The author should try to explain his feelings and find a middle ground. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not violating any agreed-upon boundaries and his actions aren't deceptive, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong. However, it's a matter of differing needs that need to be resolved through discussion. The answer is likely B.\n"
