We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 19-year-old guy in a relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend for a year. They only see each other on weekends and live apart during the week. He watches porn during the week, and she already knows about it but has grown to accept it. Now, she wants him to tell her in real-time when he does it, which he finds uncomfortable and shaming. He's asking if he's unreasonable for not wanting to inform her immediately after.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age aspect. In many places, the legal age of consent is 18, so she's 17. That might affect the situation's legality, but the question is about being in the wrong in terms of the relationship, not the law. Assuming they're in a legal and consensual relationship, the focus is on their communication and boundaries.\n\nThe girlfriend wants more openness about his porn use. Maybe she's struggling with trust or feels excluded. But the author is okay with her knowing he watches porn but not with the timing of when he tells her. He feels ashamed and wants to keep it private as a personal release.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it reasonable for him to not want to inform her immediately after? The girlfriend's request is for real-time disclosure, which he finds uncomfortable. The author's discomfort is valid; privacy is important, and feeling shamed about personal habits is a common issue. However, in a relationship, transparency and communication are usually important. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with him watching porn, she might need reassurance that he's not being secretive or hiding other behaviors. But the author is already disclosing that he does it, just not in real-time.\n\nThe question is about the timing of the disclosure. The author isn't lying; he's choosing when to share. If the girlfriend's request is to know as it happens, that's a specific boundary she's setting. The author might feel that having to tell her right after takes away his privacy and adds stress. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that real-time knowledge would help her feel more at ease.\n\nI should think about mutual respect and compromise. If they're in a healthy relationship, both should be able to express their feelings without feeling blamed. The girl's request might be about her emotional needs, but the guy's need for privacy after the act is also understandable. The author isn't wrong for feeling uncomfortable, but is he wrong for not complying with her request?\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't being deceptive, so he's not in the wrong for that. However, refusing to meet her emotional needs might be seen as not being considerate. But since he already discloses the behavior, just not in real-time, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the request is reasonable. Some might argue that if she's uncomfortable, he should respect that, but others might say that personal privacy is important and not being in the wrong for that.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's being honest about his actions. The girlfriend's request might be too much for him, and he has the right to privacy in his personal habits. However, there's also a need for them to discuss and find a middle ground. But strictly on the question of whether he's in the wrong for not telling her immediately, the answer is B, No.\n"
