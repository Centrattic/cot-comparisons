We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The girlfriend wants him to inform her while he's doing it, which he finds uncomfortable and shaming. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been together a year, and he's 19, she's 17. They only see each other on weekends, which might contribute to communication challenges. The girlfriend has accepted that he watches porn but now wants to be informed in real-time. The author feels it's a private matter and doesn't want to share that information immediately after.\n\nI should think about communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's request stems from her need for reassurance. On the other hand, the author's discomfort is valid if he feels it's a personal activity he doesn't want to discuss. It's about balancing these two perspectives.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could explain his feelings without agreeing to her initial request. He might offer alternative ways to address her concerns, like discussing it after the fact but not during. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to comply with her request as stated.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and communication are key, but so is respecting each other's boundaries. If the author is honest about his reasons and they can find a compromise, that's ideal. But if he refuses to engage in any discussion or refuses to meet her halfway, that could be problematic. However, in this case, he's not refusing to communicate entirely; he's explaining his discomfort. \n\nThe key point is whether his refusal is unreasonable. Since both parties have valid feelings\u2014her need for reassurance and his discomfort\u2014it's about negotiation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not wanting to share the exact timing, but he should be willing to talk about it in a way that makes both comfortable. So, the answer might hinge on whether he's open to finding a solution rather than just refusing outright.\n"
