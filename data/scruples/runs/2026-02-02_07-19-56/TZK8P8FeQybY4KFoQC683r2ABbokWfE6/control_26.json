      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, and they've been together for a year. They only see each other on weekends because he's studying in another city. He watches porn during the week, which she doesn't like but has accepted. Now, she wants him to tell her when he's watching porn while he's doing it. He feels uncomfortable and ashamed about it, and doesn't want to tell her immediately after because he wants to just move on from it and deal with it alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl is asking for communication as a way to feel more secure. She might be dealing with jealousy or anxiety, and wants reassurance. On the other hand, the author feels that this request makes him uncomfortable and that the act of watching porn is something he does privately for stress relief. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's request is about wanting to be part of the conversation, which is understandable. However, the author's discomfort is also valid. If someone is making him feel ashamed, that's a red flag. It's important to respect each other's feelings. But here, the author isn't hiding the fact that he watches porn; he's just not disclosing the exact times. He's already been open about it to some extent. \n\nBut then again, if the girlfriend's request is based on trust and feeling secure, not just control, then the author's refusal might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs. However, the author is in a position where he's doing something private, and the act of informing her in real-time could make the situation awkward or even trigger anxiety in the girlfriend. \n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend might be setting boundaries that are reasonable, and the author is not respecting them. But if the author feels that the request is causing him distress, it's a balance. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can find a compromise. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend is asking for something that's reasonable and within the bounds of mutual respect, and the author refuses without a valid reason, then he might be in the wrong. However, if the request is intrusive or causing harm to him, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nIn this case, the act of watching porn is not illegal or harmful, and the author isn't being deceptive. He's already open about it. The girlfriend's request is about immediate disclosure, which the author finds uncomfortable. Since the act itself is a personal choice and the author isn't hiding it, just the timing, it might be that he's not in the wrong. However, the refusal to communicate could also be seen as a lack of consideration for her feelings. \n\nBut considering that the author is in a long-distance situation and the act is for stress relief, and that he's already been honest about watching porn, the immediate disclosure might be more about her anxiety than his deception. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong because the request is too personal and causing him discomfort. Relationships require compromise, but so do individual boundaries. If the girlfriend is unable to respect his privacy, then maybe that's her issue. \n\nOn the other hand, if she's trying to build trust through communication and he refuses, that could be a problem. But since he's already been honest, just not in real-time, it's a bit of a gray area. The key here is mutual respect. If he's not violating any previous agreements they've made about porn use, then he's not in the wrong. The girlfriend's request might be unreasonable if it's causing him distress without a clear benefit to their relationship. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's maintaining his privacy and isn't being deceptive. The girlfriend's request might be valid, but the author's feelings also matter. So the answer is B.\n"
