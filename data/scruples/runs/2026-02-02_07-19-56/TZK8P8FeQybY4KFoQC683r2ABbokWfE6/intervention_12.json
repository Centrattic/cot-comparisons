We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the guy watches porn and the girlfriend wants him to tell her exactly when he does it. He feels ashamed and wants privacy, while she wants the transparency to feel calmer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy argues that it's just for quick relief and he wants to keep it private because it makes him uncomfortable. The girl wants the openness because it helps her anxiety. So, there's a conflict between privacy and emotional needs.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual understanding are key. The girl's request is about her emotional comfort. However, the guy's discomfort is valid too. Maybe there's a middle ground here. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to share the exact time he watches porn. \n\nI think it's important to assess whether his stance is unreasonable. If the girl's request is causing him to feel ashamed every time, maybe there's an issue with the way they approach this. But the fact that she has grown to accept it before suggests there was some compromise. Now she wants more. Does he have the right to his privacy? Or is he being secretive?\n\nAlso, considering their age difference and the fact that they're in a long-distance situation, maybe the girl is seeking reassurance because of separation anxiety. The guy might feel that his privacy is being invaded. \n\nI need to check if there's a standard about this. In many relationships, watching porn is a personal matter, and partners might have different comfort levels. If the girl is okay with him watching porn in general but wants specific timing, maybe the issue is about control or trust. The guy might feel that she's overstepping. \n\nBut the question is whether he's wrong for refusing. If he's honest about his reasons and they can find another way she feels reassured, then it's a communication problem. However, if he's being non-transparent without valid reason, maybe he's in the wrong. But his discomfort is real. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Some people might think that being open about such things is part of the relationship. Others might side with the guy's need for privacy. It's tricky. The author might not be in the wrong if he's communicated his feelings and they can't reach a compromise. But if he's being dishonest or causing her unnecessary worry, then he could be wrong. But the scenario says he's honest after the fact, just not during. \n\nHmm. Maybe the issue is about the immediacy. She wants to know while he's doing it, which he finds awkward. There's a valid point in both sides. Since he's not hiding it, just timing, perhaps he's not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
