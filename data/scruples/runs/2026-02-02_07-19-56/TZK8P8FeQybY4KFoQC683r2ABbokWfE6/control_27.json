We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a one-year relationship, only see each other on weekends. He's 19, she's 17. He watches porn during the week, and she wants him to inform her in real-time when he does it. He finds this shameful and uncomfortable, wanting to keep it private. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Communication is key in any relationship, but there are boundaries. The girlfriend is 17, which is under 18, but the age of consent varies by location, but since they're in a one-year relationship, maybe that's not the main issue here. The main issue is about privacy and mutual respect.\n\nThe girlfriend wants to know when he watches porn, which he's okay with her knowing he does it, but not the timing. He feels it's something personal and doesn't want to share the exact moments. The question is whether his stance is unreasonable.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to feel comfortable. If the girlfriend feels insecure or anxious not knowing, maybe there's an underlying issue. But the author's discomfort is also valid. Watching porn is a personal activity, and feeling ashamed might indicate his own internalized stigma, which is common. But should he have to share it in real-time?\n\nThe girlfriend is asking for reassurance, which is understandable. However, the requirement to inform her at the time might be too much for the author. It's a balance between her need for trust and his need for privacy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's 17 might mean she's less experienced in relationships and might not realize the importance of personal boundaries. However, since they are in a committed relationship, mutual respect should be there. \n\nIs the author being unreasonable? It depends on whether the girlfriend's request is reasonable. If she's asking for information that's invasive to his privacy without a valid reason beyond her own anxiety, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if she's trying to build trust and transparency, that's also important.\n\nLooking at similar situations, many people find watching porn a private matter. However, in a relationship, some level of openness is expected. But the key is not to make each other uncomfortable. The author's discomfort suggests that her request crosses a boundary. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he has the right to his privacy, and the girlfriend's request is unreasonable if it makes him uncomfortable without a clear, mutual agreement. The author isn't violating any trust by not telling her the exact times; he's just keeping a personal habit private, which is his right.\n"
