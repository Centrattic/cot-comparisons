We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 19-year-old male in a one-year relationship with a 17-year-old girlfriend. They only see each other on weekends, and he studies in a different city. He watches porn during the week. She's okay with it now, but she wants him to tell her when he does it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable doing that and wants to keep it private. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by not agreeing to this.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The girlfriend is asking for something that makes her feel more comfortable. She wants to know when he watches porn, which suggests she's seeking reassurance or transparency. However, the author feels that this request makes him uncomfortable and that he wants to keep this part of his life private. \n\nNow, considering the age difference and the fact that they're both young, there might be different maturity levels in handling such topics. The girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or a desire to feel included. But the author has a right to his privacy, especially regarding personal habits that don't harm her. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could explain his feelings to her, emphasizing that his porn use is a personal activity and not a reflection on their relationship. He could reassure her in other ways without giving her exact times. However, he's not wrong for not wanting to disclose that information. Privacy is a valid boundary, especially if it's not affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nThe girlfriend might need to respect his privacy, but she also has the right to express her needs. It seems like a communication issue rather than a clear case of right or wrong. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but he might need to communicate his reasons better to her. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because maintaining privacy in personal activities is a reasonable boundary, even if the partner is uncomfortable with it. It's about mutual respect and finding a compromise that works for both.\n"
