We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that he's 19, she's 17, they've been together a year, and they only see each other on weekends. He watches porn during the week and she wants him to tell her when he does it, but he feels ashamed and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They are in a committed relationship, but they have long-distance elements since they're in different cities. Communication is key in any relationship, especially long-distance. However, there's also the aspect of personal privacy. Watching porn is a personal activity, and many people might find it uncomfortable to discuss it in real-time.\n\nThe girlfriend wants to know so that it calms her. That suggests she might have anxiety or trust issues. It's important to validate her feelings, but the author also has his own boundaries. There's a balance between respecting each other's needs. The author isn't refusing to communicate entirely; he's just not willing to share the information in real-time. Maybe he could communicate after the fact, which might be a middle ground.\n\nLegally, the age of consent varies, but since she's 17 and he's 19, they need to ensure that their relationship complies with local laws. However, the question here is about the moral aspect of the situation, not legality. \n\nThe author's discomfort is valid. Feeling ashamed might stem from societal stigma around pornography. It's important for both partners to have open and non-judgmental conversations. The fact that she's grown to accept it but still wants more transparency indicates she's trying to find comfort. However, the author's need for privacy is also a personal boundary.\n\nOther factors: The author might be using porn for stress relief, which is a common reason. If he's not using it to the detriment of their relationship, maybe it's a personal choice. The key is mutual respect. The author isn't hiding it completely; he's just not disclosing the timing. Is that unreasonable? It could depend on how open they've been about it before. If he's already being honest about watching it, then perhaps the issue is the timing of the disclosure.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is often necessary. The author could explain his feelings to her and see if there's a way they can both feel comfortable. Maybe setting a time to talk about it after the fact instead of during. But the question is if he's in the wrong for not wanting to tell her in the moment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He has valid reasons for his stance, and the girlfriend's request is about her comfort. It's a matter of differing needs, and both need to find a compromise. Since he's not being deceptive and is honest about the activity, just not the timing, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the girlfriend's request is about transparency to build trust, then maybe there's room for discussion. But the author isn't violating any agreement, just setting a boundary. So B seems more likely.\n"
