We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is a guy in a 1-year relationship with his girlfriend. She's 17, he's 19. They see each other only on weekends because he studies in a different city. The issue is about him watching porn during the week, and she wants him to tell her exactly when he does it, while he's doing it. He feels ashamed and uncomfortable about it and doesn't want to tell her right away.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age aspect. The girlfriend is 17, which is the minimum legal age in many places, but the relationship dynamics might be affected by the age difference. However, the legality isn't the main issue here. The core problem is about communication and boundaries regarding porn consumption.\n\nThe girlfriend wants transparency for her peace of mind. She's not necessarily asking to know the content, just the timing. She's accepted that he watches porn but wants immediate communication. The author feels that doing so would make him uncomfortable and that he wants to keep it private as a personal, stress-relieving activity.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. However, mutual respect and understanding are also important. The author's discomfort is valid; some people feel embarrassed about certain aspects of their private life. On the other hand, the girlfriend's request might stem from insecurity or a need for reassurance. The question is whether the author's refusal is unreasonable.\n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend is seeking a level of control or closeness that the author isn't comfortable with. If the author isn't being secretive about the fact that he watches porn, just the exact timing, then maybe his stance is understandable. However, if the girlfriend feels that this lack of immediate disclosure is a form of dishonesty or neglect, that could be a point of contention.\n\nAnother angle is how both parties are respecting each other's boundaries. The author might be within his rights to keep the timing private, especially if the act itself isn't a deal-breaker for the relationship. However, if the girlfriend's request is reasonable for her emotional well-being, the author might need to find a middle ground. But since he feels it's uncomfortable, it's a matter of balancing both needs.\n\nI should also consider if there's a cultural or social norm here. Some people might think that being upfront about such habits is necessary for trust, while others might see it as an invasion of privacy. The author might not be wrong if he's honest about his feelings and the request isn't part of any agreement they made. However, if the request is part of their communication and he refuses without discussion, that could be a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on how they communicate their needs. If he's not hiding the fact he watches porn and is open about it, then not disclosing the exact timing might not be wrong. But if the girlfriend's request is about building trust and he refuses without understanding her perspective, it could be seen as not being considerate enough. However, given his discomfort, it's a personal issue, and he's not necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his own feelings here.\n"
