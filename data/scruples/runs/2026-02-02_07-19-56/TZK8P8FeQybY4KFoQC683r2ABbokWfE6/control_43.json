We only see each other during the weekend. During the week I study in a city far away from the place she lives.\nI watch porn during the week. She still dislikes it that I do it, but has grown to accept it. The conversation about porn come up today again and she now wants me to tell her i do it, while doing it. She says it calms her to know it. \nI don\u2019t agree with this however. It ashames me and makes me feel uncomfortable. After I did the deed, I just want to get it out of my mind. It\u2019s just something I want to do alone for a quick relief, no strings attached. \nI don\u2019t really know how to put it properly in words how I feel. Do other guys feel the same?\nAm I unreasonable for not wanting to tell her immediately after I watched porn?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to tell his girlfriend exactly when he watches porn. The situation is that they're in a year-long relationship, they only see each other on weekends, and during the week, he's studying elsewhere. He watches porn, which she's not fond of but has accepted. Now she wants him to inform her in real-time when he does it, but he feels ashamed and wants to keep it private.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's request might come from a place of wanting to feel secure and included in his life. If she's uncomfortable with his porn use, being informed could help her manage her feelings. However, the author's discomfort and shame are valid too. Watching porn is a private activity, and needing to report it in real-time might interfere with his privacy and personal autonomy.\n\nNext, communication is key in relationships. The fact that they've discussed this before and she's accepted his porn use suggests some level of mutual understanding. But her current request might indicate a need for more transparency, which he's not willing to provide. It's possible that her request is reasonable from her standpoint, but he's within his rights to set boundaries regarding his privacy.\n\nAlso, considering the dynamics of their relationship\u2014long-distance and only seeing each other on weekends\u2014their communication patterns might be different. He might feel that this is a personal matter he doesn't want to discuss, especially when it's something he uses for stress relief. However, if she's feeling anxious or insecure because of it, not communicating could lead to more issues down the line.\n\nI should check if there's a middle ground. For example, maybe he can inform her after the fact without the immediate notification, or they can establish a way to discuss his porn use without the real-time requirement. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for refusing the immediate disclosure.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no obligation to share such personal information unless there's a mutual agreement. However, in relationships, expectations can vary. If the agreement they had was mutual acceptance without real-time reporting, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if her new request is part of maintaining trust and she's expressed her need for it, he might be expected to accommodate it for the relationship's health.\n\nBut since he's 19 and she's 17, there might be age-of-consent considerations, but since the question is about the porn-watching and disclosure, not the relationship legality itself. So focusing on the disclosure issue, the author's reluctance is about privacy and discomfort, which are valid personal feelings. However, if the relationship requires mutual respect for each other's feelings, he might need to find a way to address her anxiety without compromising his own boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a balance between respecting personal privacy and meeting a partner's emotional needs. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might need to find a compromise. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No) because his feelings of discomfort and desire for privacy are valid, and he's not obligated to share that information if it's causing him distress.\n"
