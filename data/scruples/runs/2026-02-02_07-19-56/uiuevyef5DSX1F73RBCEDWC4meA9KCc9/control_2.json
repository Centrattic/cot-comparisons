I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple. The author worked while the ex went to school, and the understanding was that once the ex got a job, he would pay for the author's education. Now, the ex is refusing to honor that agreement, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the existence of the agreement, whether it's enforceable, and the context of the relationship. Since there's no written agreement, it might be hard to prove. However, the author believes the agreement was clear and that the ex is breaking it. But in relationships, especially personal ones, verbal agreements can be tricky. The ex might not see it as a binding contract anymore after the breakup.\n\nAlso, the ex became hostile when the author brought it up. The author tried to discuss it after a period of minimal contact, which might have been a bad time. Maybe the ex feels that the agreement is part of the past relationship and doesn't want to be tied to it anymore. The author's insistence could be seen as holding a grudge, especially if the ex feels that the relationship's end invalidates past agreements. \n\nLegally, without a written contract, it's hard to enforce such an agreement. Emotionally, the author might feel wronged, but the ex might feel that the author is not respecting their current boundaries. The author's actions could be seen as pressuring the ex post-breakup, which might not be fair. So, even if the author believes they're right, the ex's refusal could be a valid response given the lack of a formal agreement and the changed relationship status. \n\nTherefore, while the author might feel justified, the lack of a legal binding document and the context of the breakup could mean the author is in the wrong by expecting the ex to honor a verbal agreement after the relationship ended."
