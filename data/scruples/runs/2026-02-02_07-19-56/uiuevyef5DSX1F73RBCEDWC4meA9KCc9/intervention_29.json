I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement made during their relationship. The situation is that the author supported their ex financially while he went to school, expecting him to pay for her education once he was employed. Now they're separated, and the ex is refusing to honor the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. Legally, without a written contract, enforcing such an agreement might be difficult. The user mentions there was no written agreement, so from a legal standpoint, the ex might not be obligated to pay. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which might not strictly be a legal question but more about moral responsibility or social expectations.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The user argues that since there was a mutual understanding, the ex should still honor it. But relationships often have unspoken expectations and agreements that aren't formal. If the ex is now hostile, maybe he feels it's no longer his responsibility now that they're not a couple. The user is trying to pursue this, but the ex isn't cooperating. \n\nI should also think about the intent behind the agreement. Was it a formal, serious agreement, or more of a casual promise? The author says they \"had an agreement,\" but the ex might not see it the same way. Also, the user is reaching out after minimal contact, which could be seen as reopening old wounds or being inconsiderate. \n\nAnother point is the financial aspect. The user covered almost everything for the ex while he was in school. If the ex is now employed, maybe he can afford to help, but if the relationship ended, does that duty still stand? Some might say that once the relationship is over, those obligations are too. Others might argue that if a promise was made, it's still valid regardless of the relationship status.\n\nThe user's approach is to keep calmly arguing, but if the ex is hostile and the agreement isn't binding, this might not be effective. It could also be seen as pressuring the ex, which isn't healthy post-breakup. The user might be overstepping by expecting the ex to follow through on a personal promise without legal backing.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the agreement was considered a formal contract or just a relationship-based promise. Without a written agreement, the ex isn't legally bound, but morally, it's debatable. However, since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because the agreement's enforceability is questionable, and pursuing it after the breakup might be seen as unfair. But some might say B (no) if they believe in keeping promises regardless of the situation.\n"
