I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's look at this scenario. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for holding their ex to an agreement made during their relationship.\n\nThe agreement was that the author would work while the ex went to school, and once the ex was employed, they would pay for the author's education. Now the ex is refusing, saying the agreement means \"shit now.\" The author is reaching out and arguing that the ex should honor the verbal agreement even though they're no longer together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Since there's no written agreement, legally it's hard to enforce. But ethically, the question is whether the author's expectation is reasonable. Verbal agreements can be considered binding in some contexts, but without a written contract, it's tricky. Relationships are personal, and agreements made in that context might be based on trust and mutual understanding, not formal legal terms.\n\nThe ex is now employed and the author wants them to pay tuition. The ex is hostile, which suggests they might not want to be bound by that agreement anymore. The author is maintaining that the ex should keep their word regardless of the relationship status. But is that a fair expectation? \n\nRelationships can change, and so can people's circumstances. The ex might feel the agreement was part of the relationship and not applicable anymore once it ended. The author's reasoning is that the ex benefited from the support during their schooling and should reciprocate. However, the ex might argue that the agreement was conditional on the continuation of the relationship. If the relationship ended before they completed school, maybe the agreement isn't valid anymore. \n\nAlso, the author mentions \"minimal contact\" to heal, but then brings up the agreement. The timing of the request could matter. If the ex is in a new job but not yet earning enough, or if the author hasn't completed their schooling yet, the ex might feel the terms aren't met. The author might be assuming the agreement is still valid, but the ex might not see it that way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on how the agreement was perceived. If both parties understood it as a binding commitment, maybe not. But since it's verbal and the relationship ended, it's more about personal ethics and the ex's willingness to honor it. The author's persistence might be reasonable, but the ex's refusal is also understandable. However, the author's actions are based on the belief that the ex should follow through, which could be seen as expecting something from a past relationship's terms after it's over. That might not be fair, especially if the agreement wasn't formalized. \n\nI think the key here is the lack of a written contract. Without that, the agreement is more of a promise that can be broken without legal consequences. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't wrong to want the support, but the ex isn't wrong to not want to fulfill a past verbal agreement after the relationship ended. The author might be in the wrong if the agreement was based on mutual trust during the relationship and the ex is no longer willing to uphold it post-breakup. So, the answer is A.\n"
