I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The key points from the story are: they had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's school once he got a job. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to hold the ex to that agreement, but the ex is refusing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since it wasn't written, it's an oral agreement. In many jurisdictions, oral agreements can be legally binding, but they can be hard to enforce without evidence. However, the main issue here isn't just legal but about personal ethics and relationships.\n\nThe author is trying to get their ex to honor a commitment made during the relationship. The ex is now hostile and saying the agreement means nothing. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for continuing to pursue this.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Expectations in Relationships**: The agreement was part of a mutual understanding during the relationship. However, after a breakup, people often expect that personal matters are now separate. The author might be assuming the ex is still obligated, but the ex might see the relationship as over, so the agreement is no longer valid.\n\n2. **Legal Standing**: Without a written contract, proving the agreement exists could be difficult. Even if legal, it's unclear if the court would enforce such an agreement, especially if it was part of a personal relationship rather than a business arrangement.\n\n3. **Ethical Perspective**: The author feels the ex should keep their word, which is a moral stance. But the ex might feel that the agreement was part of a mutual arrangement that's no longer relevant now that they're separated. The author's insistence might be seen as trying to extend a relationship obligation into a post-breakup scenario, which the ex might not agree with.\n\n4. **Communication and Timing**: The author reached out during a time of minimal contact to discuss this. The ex's hostility could be due to feeling pressured or that the author is reopening wounds. The author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate, even if their intent is to get what they believe is owed.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's position is understandable from a moral standpoint, but the ex's refusal might be based on the belief that the agreement is no longer valid post-breakup. The lack of a written agreement makes it hard to enforce, and the author's continued pursuit might be seen as not respecting the ex's current boundaries. Therefore, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong because they're expecting a personal agreement to hold up in a dissolved relationship without legal backing, which is a common reason for such agreements to fail post-breakup.\n"
