I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an agreement between an ex-couple where the man promised to pay for the woman's education after he graduated, in exchange for her supporting him while he was in school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The key point here is that there was no written contract, just an oral agreement. In many places, oral agreements can still be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce because there's no written proof. However, the question isn't just about legal enforceability but also about moral and ethical expectations.\n\nThe woman is now reaching out to her ex to ask him to fulfill his part of the agreement. He's being hostile and refusing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, suggesting maybe the agreement wasn't a real commitment or that the woman is being unreasonable in expecting it to be honored after the relationship ended.\n\nI should think about the context. The agreement was made during the time they were dating, which might have been a period of trust and mutual support. However, relationships can change, and sometimes agreements made in one context (like being in a romantic relationship) might not hold up when the relationship ends. The ex might feel that the agreement is no longer valid now that they're separated, especially if there's no formal contract.\n\nAnother angle is the expectation of payment post-breakup. Even if there was a verbal agreement, after the relationship ends, the ex isn't obligated to continue supporting the former partner unless there's a legal contract. The woman is trying to enforce a moral obligation rather than a legal one. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship and not a binding commitment once it's over.\n\nAlso, the way the woman approached the discussion\u2014starting with small talk before bringing up the agreement\u2014might have been misinterpreted. However, the main issue is whether the agreement still holds. The woman's insistence could be seen as holding onto a past promise that the other person no longer feels bound by, which could be why he's hostile.\n\nBut then again, if the agreement was a mutual understanding and part of their arrangement during the relationship, it's reasonable for the woman to expect it to be honored. However, the lack of a written agreement might make it a matter of personal ethics rather than enforceable law. So, the ex could be in the wrong for not following through, but the woman might be in the wrong for expecting it after the breakup, especially if the ex is no longer in a position to do so or if the agreement was contingent on the relationship continuing.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. In terms of right or wrong, the author is trying to make the ex honor a verbal agreement. If the ex is now unwilling and there's no legal recourse, the author's continued pursuit might be seen as unreasonable. On the other hand, if the ex was in a position to fulfill the promise and is refusing, the author might have a point.\n\nBut the key here is that the agreement was made during a romantic relationship. Such agreements can sometimes be seen as part of the relationship's dynamics rather than a formal contract. Once the relationship ends, the obligation might not be expected to carry over. The woman might be in the wrong for not recognizing that the breakup could change the terms of the agreement. Alternatively, if the agreement was a key part of their mutual support, maybe the ex is in the wrong.\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of a written agreement and the context of a past relationship. Even if the agreement was made in good faith, the ex might now view it as part of the relationship that no longer exists. The author's insistence could be seen as holding onto a past promise without considering the changed circumstances. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for expecting the ex to still be bound by that agreement without a formal contract.\n"
