I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement. The situation is that the author worked while the ex went to school, and there was an understanding that once the ex was employed, they'd pay for the author's school. Now, after they've broken up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether such a verbal agreement holds any weight legally. From what I know, verbal agreements can be tricky. They're legally binding in some cases, but proving the terms can be difficult without a written contract. So maybe the author is right in wanting the agreement honored, but without written proof, it's hard to enforce. The ex might be right in saying the agreement is now meaningless since there's no legal recourse.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship. The agreement was made during a romantic relationship, so the ex might feel that the terms have changed now that they're no longer together. People often act differently in relationships versus after a breakup. The author might be seeing it as a personal contract, but the ex might not want to be bound by that anymore. \n\nAlso, the author's approach: they reached out during a time of minimal contact to discuss the agreement. The ex became hostile, possibly because they felt ambushed or that the author is bringing up the past. The author might be in the wrong if they're pressuring someone who's already emotionally invested in moving on. The ex might not want to deal with the past and see the agreement as part of the relationship that's over.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author isn't asking for anything more than the agreed-upon tuition, which they provided in return for the ex's future work. It's a matter of fairness and keeping promises. If the ex is now financially stable, the author's claim might have merit morally, even if legally it's not enforceable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Legally, without a written agreement, it's weak. Emotionally, the ex might feel the author is being pushy. But the author might feel they're just holding up their end of a mutual deal. The fact that the author is calmly arguing and not being aggressive might tip it towards them not being in the wrong, but the lack of a formal agreement is a problem. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but the situation is complicated. The ex might be wrong not to honor the agreement, but the author's insistence could be seen as unreasonable if there's no contract. However, since the agreement was mutual and based on trust, the author's stance could be justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
