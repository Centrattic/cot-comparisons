I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the guy was supposed to pay for the woman's education after he finished school and got a job. Now, after they broke up, she's trying to get him to honor that agreement, but he's being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be hard. However, the question here isn't about legal right but moral or social wrong. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in expecting the agreement to be honored post-breakup.\n\nThe key points to analyze: Did the agreement have clear terms? Both parties expected to fulfill it. The woman supported him while he was in school, trusting he'd pay her tuition when he could. Now that he's employed, she's asking for her part. The ex is refusing, possibly because the relationship ended, and he doesn't feel obligated anymore.\n\nBut is she wrong for holding him to it? From a moral standpoint, if there was a mutual agreement, she's not in the wrong for expecting it to be honored. However, relationships can complicate things. People might see it as mixing personal and financial matters, which can be problematic. If the agreement wasn't formalized, some might argue that it's too much to expect after a breakup, especially if there's no legal proof.\n\nBut the woman's argument is that she supported him under the understanding he would reciprocate. If he benefited from her support under that agreement, then she's within her rights to ask for her end. However, the ex's refusal could be due to changed circumstances or the end of the relationship. The question is whether the author's insistence is reasonable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both parties' perspectives. The woman isn't being unreasonable in expecting her part of the agreement. The ex is being hostile, which might be his own issue. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking what she believes is her due based on a mutual agreement. However, the lack of a written contract might make her position less defensible in a legal sense, but the question is about being in the wrong socially or morally.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to hold up her end of the bargain, and it's reasonable to expect the same from him, even after a breakup, if there was a clear mutual understanding.\n"
