I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an agreement between an ex-couple where the ex promised to pay for the author's education after finishing his own schooling. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The author mentions it was an informal agreement, not written down. In most legal systems, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but they're often harder to prove. The ex is now saying the agreement means nothing, so there's a conflict here about whether the agreement was binding.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they supported the ex during his schooling, and in return, he should support her now. The ex might feel that now that the relationship is over, they don't have to honor that agreement. The author is trying to calmly argue the point, but the ex is hostile. The key here is whether the agreement is valid and enforceable without a written contract.\n\nI should think about the concept of consideration in contracts. In legal terms, consideration is something of value exchanged between the parties. The author worked while the ex went to school, which could be seen as consideration for his future payment. However, without a clear written agreement, it's possible that a court might not enforce it, especially if the ex disputes the terms or intent.\n\nAlso, the situation involves a personal relationship, which complicates things. Once the relationship ended, the ex might feel that the agreement is no longer relevant, even if it was made in good faith before. The author's persistence could be seen as holding onto something from the past, especially if the ex is unwilling to proceed.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The author is using the term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?), which suggests they're aware that others might see their actions as unreasonable. The fact that the ex became hostile might indicate that the author's approach could be perceived as pressuring or not respecting the ended relationship.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel they're justified in expecting payment based on the agreement, the lack of a written contract and the ex's refusal could mean the author is overstepping, especially in a post-breakup context. The legal standing is weak, and the approach might be seen as unfair given the current relationship status. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
