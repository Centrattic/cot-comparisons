I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a verbal agreement between an ex-couple where the ex agreed to pay for the author's education after he finished school and got a job. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's no written agreement, it's a verbal one. Verbal agreements can be legally binding in some cases, but they're hard to enforce, especially when it comes to financial matters. Without a contract or witnesses, it's difficult to prove the terms of the agreement. The ex might not be legally obligated to follow through, even if there was an understanding between them.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical side. The author believes the ex should keep his word, which is a valid point. However, after a breakup, people might change their minds about such agreements, especially if they're not formalized. The author's approach might be seen as holding onto the relationship in a way that's not healthy, especially if they're both supposed to be taking space to heal. Pursuing the ex for money could be viewed as using the past relationship to gain something, which might be seen as unfair.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached the discussion could play a role. They mentioned that the ex became hostile, possibly misinterpreting the conversation. The author might be coming off as persistent or not respecting the ex's boundaries, especially if the ex is trying to move on. The minimal contact was agreed upon for healing, so bringing up the agreement might be seen as violating that boundary.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the agreement was clear and mutual. If the ex now disputes the terms or doesn't remember the agreement, the author's insistence might be based on a misunderstanding. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship and isn't binding anymore since the relationship has ended.\n\nIn terms of possible actions, without a written agreement, the author might not have legal recourse. They could try mediation, but the ex's hostility suggests that this might not be successful. The author is advised to \"calmly argue,\" but if the ex isn't willing to engage, this might not be effective.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as reasonable from a moral standpoint but impractical or even ethically questionable if they're overstepping boundaries post-breakup. The lack of a written agreement makes it hard to enforce, and the approach could be harming the healing process. So, while the author might believe they're right, others might think they're in the wrong for trying to extract something from a past relationship without legal backing and possibly causing conflict.\n"
