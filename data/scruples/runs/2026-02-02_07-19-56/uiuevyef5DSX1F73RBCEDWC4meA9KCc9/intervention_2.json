I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their ex had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and the ex would pay for the author's school once employed. Now, the ex is refusing to honor that agreement, and the author is trying to get them to pay up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The key point here is whether the agreement was a legal contract or just a verbal understanding. Since the author mentions there was no written agreement, it might be hard to enforce legally. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be tricky to prove, especially if there's no evidence of consideration (i.e., something of value exchanged between the parties).\n\nThe author is arguing that they upheld their part by supporting the ex while they were in school. But the ex is now saying the agreement is meaningless. The problem here is that relationships can change, and what was once a mutual agreement might be seen as a past understanding once the relationship ends. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship and that it's no longer binding now that they're separated.\n\nAnother angle is the expectation of payment. The author expects the ex to pay tuition costs because of the agreement, but without a written contract, the ex isn't legally obligated. The author's continued insistence might come off as holding a grudge or trying to extract money post-breakup, which could be seen as unfair. The ex might feel that the author is pressuring them emotionally, especially if the conversation started with some hostility.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached the discussion matters. They mentioned they were interacting nicely and then brought up the agreement. The ex's hostility could stem from feeling ambushed or that the author is using the friendly conversation as a setup to ask for money. That could be a breach of trust, making the ex feel manipulated.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might argue that the author is justified in expecting the ex to honor their word. However, others might say that once the relationship ended, the agreement isn't binding, especially without legal enforceability. The author's persistence could be seen as inconsiderate, given the breakup and the need for space.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement likely isn't enforceable without a written contract, and pressing the ex post-breakup could be seen as inappropriate. The ex's hostility might be a reaction to the author's insistence on an informal agreement made during a committed relationship.\n"
