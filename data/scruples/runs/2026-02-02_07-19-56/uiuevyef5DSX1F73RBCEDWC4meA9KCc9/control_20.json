I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the ex agreed to pay for the author's school once he got a job. Now they're broken up, and the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if there's a legal obligation here. Since the agreement was verbal and not written, it might be hard to enforce. But the question isn't strictly legal; it's about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially.\n\nThe author is asking if they're right to hold the ex to the agreement. The ex is now hostile and says the agreement means nothing now. The author feels they supported the ex through school and now the ex should do the same.\n\nI need to consider if the agreement was reasonable. When the author was working while the ex went to school, the arrangement made sense as a mutual support. But once the relationship ended, is the ex still obligated? The author is right to expect some accountability, but maybe the ex feels that the agreement was part of a shared life that's over now.\n\nAlso, maybe the author's approach in bringing it up now is problematic. The ex might feel that since they're no longer a couple, they don't have to fulfill the agreement. The author is trying to be calm and persistent, but the ex is upset. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the agreement was a personal promise between them, the author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting it to be kept. However, the ex might have a different perspective, especially after the relationship ended. But the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to follow through on what they understood as a mutual agreement, even if it's hard to enforce now. The key point is that the author is not in the wrong for expecting the ex to keep the agreement, even if the ex is avoiding it. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
