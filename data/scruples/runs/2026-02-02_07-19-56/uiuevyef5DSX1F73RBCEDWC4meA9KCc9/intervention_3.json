I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author (AITA) and their ex had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, he would pay for the author's education. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement. The ex got hostile when the author brought it up, saying the agreement means nothing now. The author is arguing that the ex should still keep his word even though they're not together anymore.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider if such an agreement is enforceable. Since it's just a verbal agreement, there's no written contract. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving the terms might be difficult. However, the author is more concerned about moral obligation rather than legal action, I think.\n\nThe ex is probably feeling that since the relationship is over, they don't have to follow through. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a promise that should be kept regardless of the relationship status. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, making a promise and expecting it to be kept even after a breakup could be seen as reasonable if the agreement was clear and mutual. But maybe the author is being too demanding, especially if the relationship ended amicably and they agreed to minimal contact for healing. Bringing up the agreement now might be seen as reopening old wounds or being opportunistic.\n\nAlso, the ex's hostility might come from feeling that the author is trying to use the past relationship to get financial support now that they're ex. It's possible the ex feels the agreement was part of the relationship dynamics and no longer applies now that they're separate. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as trying to extract something from the ex post-breakup, which might be perceived as unfair. Even if the agreement existed, once the relationship ended, the ex might not feel obligated anymore, especially if the agreement was based on the context of their relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is overstepping. They should have considered that the ex might not want to fulfill the agreement after the breakup. The author is using the agreement as a way to get tuition money, which might not be fair now that they're no longer in a relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for continuing to push the ex for something that was part of a past relationship.\n"
