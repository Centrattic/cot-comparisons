I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an agreement between an ex-couple where the man promised to pay for the woman's education after finishing his own. Now that they're separated, she's trying to enforce that agreement, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentions there's no written agreement. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to prove. Without a written contract, the woman might have a tough time enforcing the agreement in court. However, the ethical side is different. \n\nEthically, the man made a promise, and promises are important. Even if they're not in a relationship anymore, some might argue he should still honor it. On the other hand, the woman is pressuring him after the breakup, which could be seen as using the previous relationship to extract financial support. That might be problematic, especially if the man feels it's unfair now that they're not together.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. They might be considering that the woman is holding onto a past agreement in a way that's not respectful of the current separation. The man's hostility could stem from feeling that the agreement is being used against him, especially if the relationship ended and the terms were part of their mutual arrangement during the relationship. \n\nAlso, the woman's approach\u2014bringing up the agreement after minimal contact and when they were just catching up\u2014might have come off as unexpected or even manipulative. Even if she's being calm, the context of their interaction could have triggered his defensiveness. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, it's uncertain. Ethically, it's a gray area. The woman might believe she's entitled to the payment based on the agreement, but the man might feel that the agreement is no longer valid after the breakup. The woman's persistence could be seen as wrong if it's perceived as exploiting the past relationship. However, if the agreement was a genuine mutual understanding, she might feel justified in pursuing it. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of a written agreement and the nature of the request post-breakup. The woman's actions might be seen as reasonable if the agreement was a significant part of their relationship dynamics, but others might argue that once the relationship ends, financial obligations should be renegotiated or dropped. The answer likely depends on whether enforcing the agreement is seen as fair and respectful given the circumstances.\n"
