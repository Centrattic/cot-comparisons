I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The situation involves an ex-couple who had an agreement: the author worked while the ex went to school, and after the ex got a job, he was supposed to pay for the author's education. Now, the ex is refusing to honor the agreement after the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The agreement was verbal, not written. The author is trying to hold the ex to this verbal agreement even after the relationship ended. The ex is hostile and says the agreement \"means shit now.\" The author is arguing calmly but not getting anywhere.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but they're harder to prove. There's no written evidence here, so if the author takes this to court, it might be tough. But the question isn't about legal right, it's about whether the author is \"in the wrong\" morally or ethically. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, agreements made in a relationship can be tricky. If both parties genuinely believed the agreement was fair and there's no coercion, then the author might feel entitled to it. However, once the relationship is over, the ex is under no legal or moral obligation unless there's a binding contract. The author initiated contact to discuss this, which the ex found hostile. The user mentions that the ex might have misread the conversation's intent, leading to hostility.\n\nThe author's argument is that they should keep their word regardless of the relationship status. But in reality, when relationships end, personal agreements often dissolve, especially if they were part of the relationship dynamics. The author might be viewing it as a binding contract, but in reality, without a written agreement, it's more of a mutual understanding that can be broken when the relationship ends.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in believing in the agreement's validity, but expecting the ex to honor an informal verbal agreement post-breakup might be unreasonable. The ex's refusal could be seen as within their rights. The key issue is whether the agreement was mutual, clear, and if the author's expectation is reasonable now that the relationship is over. Since there's no written proof, the author might be in a difficult spot, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about legal enforceability. The author's persistence might be seen as holding a grudge or expecting something that isn't legally binding. Therefore, the answer could be that the author isn't in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored, but it's a matter of perspective. However, the ex has the right to refuse, so the author might be in the wrong if the agreement was part of the relationship and not a legally binding contract. Wait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was part of the relationship, once it ends, the obligations might not carry over. So the author is not in the wrong for expecting it, but the ex isn't obligated. The answer is probably B (No), because the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the ex is under no obligation. The question is about the author's rightness. The author's position is understandable, but the ex can say no. So the author isn't in the wrong for holding them to it, but the ex isn't wrong for refusing. Therefore, the answer is B."
