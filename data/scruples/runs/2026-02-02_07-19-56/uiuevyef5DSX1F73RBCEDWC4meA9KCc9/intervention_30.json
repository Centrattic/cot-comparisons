I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex-couple who had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and in return, the ex would pay for the author's education once employed. Now that they're separated, the author is asking the ex to honor the agreement. The ex is hostile and says the agreement \"means shit now.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Was it verbal or written? The author mentions there's no written agreement, which might complicate things legally. Verbal agreements can be hard to enforce because proving the terms can be challenging without evidence.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the ex should keep his word regardless of the relationship status. The ex, on the other hand, is no longer willing to honor the agreement. The author is continuing to ask, even after the ex became hostile. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author entered into an agreement with the ex based on their mutual understanding. If both parties agreed at the time, then ethically, the ex should follow through. However, relationships can change, and sometimes agreements made in a relationship might be based on mutual trust rather than legal binding. If the ex is now refusing, maybe because they feel the agreement is no longer valid after the breakup, that's a point to consider.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, if there was a clear understanding and the author fulfilled their part (working and supporting the ex financially), then expecting the ex to fulfill their end isn't necessarily wrong. However, the author might be in the wrong if the agreement was implicit and not clearly defined. For example, if the ex never explicitly agreed to the terms, or if the author assumed too much from a casual conversation.\n\nAlso, the way the author is approaching the ex now might be contributing to the hostility. Reaching out after a period of minimal contact to discuss a past agreement could be seen as reopening old wounds or pressuring the ex, which might be why the ex is upset. The author's persistence in arguing could be perceived as not respecting the ex's current wishes post-breakup.\n\nLegally, without a written contract, it's hard to enforce such an agreement. So the author might not have a strong case in court. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author's actions are based on a belief in the agreement, but the ex's refusal might be due to changed circumstances or the end of the relationship. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong in terms of expecting the agreement to be honored, but the lack of a written contract and the current dynamics post-breakup might mean that the author is not legally or practically able to enforce it. Whether they're morally in the wrong depends on how clear the original agreement was and the context in which it was made.\n"
