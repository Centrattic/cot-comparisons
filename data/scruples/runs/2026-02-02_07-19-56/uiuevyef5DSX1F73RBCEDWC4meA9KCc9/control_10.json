I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were in a relationship where they had an agreement: the author worked while their ex went to school, and once the ex was employed, they would pay the author's tuition. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile and saying the agreement means nothing now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether such an agreement is legally enforceable. Since there's no written contract, it's probably an oral agreement. In most places, oral agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to prove. The problem is that personal agreements between romantic partners can be tricky, especially if they're not formalized. Courts might look at whether there was consideration (something of value exchanged) and if both parties intended to create legal obligations. But since they're exes, the court might also consider the personal relationship aspect, which can complicate things.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. Even if it's not legally enforceable, is it morally right for the author to hold the ex to the agreement? The author believes in keeping promises, which is understandable. However, when a relationship ends, people sometimes re-evaluate past agreements, especially if the circumstances have changed. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship and isn't obligated anymore now that they're not together. The author might think that promises should hold regardless of the relationship status, but the ex might see it as a mutual agreement that's now moot.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached the conversation might play a role. They mentioned starting with a friendly check-in, but maybe the ex perceived the underlying intent as a demand, leading to defensiveness. The author's persistence could be seen as pressure, which might not be fair if the ex is no longer willing to honor the agreement.\n\nAnother point is the concept of \"quid pro quo\" in relationships. Sometimes, agreements in relationships are based on mutual support during the relationship, not necessarily binding post-breakup. The ex might feel that the support was part of the relationship dynamics and not a separate obligation. The author might have expected a clear, separate agreement, but if it wasn't formalized, the ex might not see it that way.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author provided significant support (covering the ex's school expenses) under the expectation of future support, the author might feel wronged. However, without a written agreement, proving intent and expectation can be challenging. The ex might not have intended for the agreement to be binding after the breakup, especially if they didn't discuss it clearly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, it's weak without a written contract. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the ex to keep their word, but the ex isn't obligated if they don't want to. The author's actions are understandable from a moral standpoint, but the ex's refusal could be based on changed circumstances or the belief that the agreement was tied to the relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complicated. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
