I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex couple who had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, he would pay for the author's education. Now, the ex is refusing, saying the agreement means \"shit now,\" and the author is trying to hold them to it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written, which is a key point. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they're not legally binding unless they meet certain conditions, which vary by jurisdiction. But even beyond legal terms, the social and ethical implications are important here.\n\nThe author and their ex are in a post-breakup situation. The user says they've been keeping minimal contact to heal. Then the author initiated a conversation, started off nicely, and brought up the agreement. The ex became hostile. The author claims it was just a friendly check-in but the ex might have felt pressured or it's a sensitive topic.\n\nEthically, should the ex be held to the agreement? The author argues that since they supported the ex during their schooling, the ex should now support them. But relationships can change, and after a breakup, people's obligations might be seen differently. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of their relationship dynamic and no longer applicable once the relationship ended. \n\nAlso, the timing of bringing it up matters. The ex might be in a different financial situation now, or the author's insistence could seem like a last-ditch effort to get something from the ex. The fact that the author is \"calmly arguing\" suggests they're not being aggressive, but the ex's reaction is hostile, which might indicate they feel it's inappropriate to discuss now or they don't want to fulfill the agreement anymore.\n\nAnother angle is that the agreement was possibly made in the context of a romantic relationship, where there might be unspoken expectations or emotional factors. Once the relationship is over, such agreements can be harder to enforce, especially if there's no legal documentation. The author's expectation might be reasonable from their perspective, but the ex might not feel the same way now, given the change in their personal and emotional circumstances.\n\nI should also consider if there's any coercion or if the agreement was mutual and fair at the time. The author mentions they wouldn't have done what they did without the agreement, implying it was a fair exchange. However, the ex's refusal could be based on their own reasons, like no longer wanting to be in a financial commitment, or perhaps the agreement was never formal or clear enough.\n\nIn terms of social norms, after a breakup, people usually move on and don't pursue past obligations, especially financial ones, unless legally enforced. The author's persistence might be seen as holding a grudge or being inconsiderate of the ex's current situation and desire for separation. \n\nSo, while the author might feel they're in the right, the ex could perceive the request as reopening old wounds or being used to their detriment. The fact that the ex is hostile might indicate that the author is pushing a topic that is no longer comfortable or acceptable post-breakup. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for continuing to pursue this agreement after the relationship has ended, especially when the ex seems resistant.\n"
