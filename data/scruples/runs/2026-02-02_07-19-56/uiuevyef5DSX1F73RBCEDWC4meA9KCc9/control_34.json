I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex couple who had an agreement where the woman worked while the man went to school, and he would pay for her education once he was employed. Now they're separated, and she's trying to get him to honor that agreement. He's been hostile, saying the agreement means nothing now. The question is whether she's wrong to hold him to it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since it was verbal and not written, that's a big factor. In many legal systems, verbal agreements can be hard to enforce unless there's some evidence of the terms. But this isn't a legal question per se; it's more about social expectations and ethics. \n\nThe key points here are: both parties had an agreement, they were in a relationship at the time, and now they're separated. The author is asking if it's reasonable to expect the ex to still fulfill the agreement. The ex's reaction is hostility, possibly interpreting the conversation as an attempt to rekindle the relationship or as pressure. \n\nI should think about whether such an agreement is binding once the relationship ends. If the agreement was made during the relationship, maybe the ex feels it's tied to the relationship and not a separate obligation now that they're not together. On the other hand, if the agreement was a mutual promise, some might argue it's still valid regardless of the relationship status. \n\nAlso, the author initiated the conversation to discuss the agreement, starting with small talk. The ex might have felt that bringing up the agreement was unexpected or that the author is trying to use the relationship to make demands. \n\nSocially, people often view personal relationships as fluid, and agreements made within them can be seen as part of the relationship dynamics rather than standalone commitments. If the relationship ended, the ex might not feel obligated anymore, especially if it's causing strain. \n\nBut the author's point is that she supported him through school, expecting reciprocal support. If he's in a better position now, some might say he should still honor the agreement because it was a fair understanding. However, others might say that once the relationship ends, such agreements can be renegotiated or abandoned since they weren't formal. \n\nThe absence of a written contract is crucial. Without it, there's no legal enforceability, but the ethical standpoint depends on perspectives. The author is trying to be calm, but the ex is resistant. The main question is whether she's within her rights to ask for this, or if she's being unreasonable. \n\nConsidering typical AITA responses, if the agreement was based on the continuation of the relationship, and the relationship ended, the ex might not feel responsible. But if the agreement was a separate mutual understanding, some might side with her. However, the ex's hostility might suggest he feels it's an issue from the past that should be dropped. \n\nI think the answer here would be B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. She had a verbal agreement, and while it's not legally binding, she's trying to address a mutual promise. However, the ex's perspective might be that the agreement is no longer relevant since they're not together. The ethical stance would depend on whether the agreement was conditional on the relationship. If the agreement was made with the understanding that it's part of their partnership, then after the breakup, it's not necessarily her fault to expect it to still hold unless he reneged. But in reality, these types of agreements are often seen as part of the relationship, so when it ends, they might not be enforceable in social terms. However, the user is asking if she's in the wrong, which is more about social judgment. Since the agreement was verbal and part of a personal relationship, the ex's refusal could be seen as valid, but she's not the asshole for trying to hold him to it. The answer might be B because it's a gray area, but the ex is the one who is not honoring the agreement.\n"
