I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the a**hole for holding their ex to an agreement they had while dating. The agreement was that the user would work while the ex went to school, and once the ex was employed, he'd pay for the user's education. The user says they don't expect the ex to live with them, just to pay tuition. They reached out to discuss this, started with a friendly check-in, but the ex got hostile and dismissed the agreement. The user now feels the ex isn't keeping his word, even though there's no written contract.\n\nFirst, I should consider the nature of the agreement. It was made during their relationship, which is a personal context, not a formal legal contract. Agreements made in personal relationships, especially romantic ones, can be tricky because emotions and circumstances change. The user is now asking if they're in the wrong for expecting this to be honored after the breakup.\n\nThe ex is no longer in a relationship with them, so maybe he feels the agreement is no longer binding. But the user argues that a promise should be kept regardless of the relationship status. However, in legal terms, for an agreement to be enforceable, it usually needs to meet certain criteria like offer, acceptance, consideration, and an intention to create legal relations. In many jurisdictions, agreements made in personal relationships, especially without a written contract, might not be enforceable in court. So the user might not have a legal recourse here.\n\nMoral and ethical angles: The user might feel it's right for the ex to honor the agreement, but the ex might see it as a past arrangement tied to their relationship, which ended. After a breakup, people might feel that certain promises or understandings are no longer applicable, especially if the relationship's dynamics have changed.\n\nAlso, the user's approach to bring up the agreement after minimal contact might be seen as resurfacing old commitments in a new context. The ex's hostility could stem from feeling that the user is trying to re-enter their life with a demand, which can be off-putting after a breakup. The user's persistence could be seen as reasonable (holding someone to a promise) or as being inconsiderate of the ex's current situation and the end of the relationship.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. Legally, the user might not have a strong case. Ethically, it's a gray area. Some might argue that keeping a promise is important, others might say that post-breakup expectations should be realistic and that the agreement was part of the relationship, which is now over. The user's insistence without a written agreement could be seen as the wrong because they might be assuming something that the ex no longer agrees to, especially after the breakup. The ex has the right to change their mind, even if it's disappointing for the user.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the user being in the wrong (A) because the agreement isn't legally binding, and after a breakup, expecting someone to honor such a personal agreement might be unreasonable. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The user's argument is about integrity, but the ex's refusal might be practical, like not being able to afford it or no longer wanting to be bound by past commitments. Without a written contract, it's hard to enforce, so the user's approach might not be justified, making them the a**hole.\n"
