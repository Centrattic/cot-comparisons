I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement. The situation is that the author worked so their ex could go to school, and when the ex started working, they were supposed to pay the author's tuition. Now, the ex is refusing to honor that agreement, and the author is trying to get them to follow through. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, which can be tricky because without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they require evidence like witnesses or a history of actions that imply the agreement exists. However, the enforceability can vary, and in some cases, courts might not recognize verbal agreements, especially for matters like tuition payments that aren't typically part of a formal contract.\n\nNext, the context of the agreement. The author and their ex were in a romantic relationship. Agreements made within a personal relationship, especially about financial matters, can be seen as less formal and more subject to change if the relationship ends. The ex might feel that since they're no longer together, the agreement is null and void. On the other hand, the author believes that the agreement was a mutual understanding and should still hold, regardless of the relationship status.\n\nEmotional and ethical aspects come into play here. The author might feel they were fair and made sacrifices, expecting reciprocity. The ex's hostility could be due to the emotional weight of the situation, where bringing up the agreement might feel like a demand after the relationship ended. It's possible the ex is struggling with their own circumstances or feels that the agreement was part of a past relationship they want to leave behind.\n\nLegally, without a written contract and perhaps witnesses, the author might have a hard time enforcing the agreement. Ethically, it's a matter of perspective. The author might see it as a matter of keeping promises, while the ex might see it as an outdated obligation from a past relationship. The author's approach of continuing to argue could be seen as persistence, but it could also be perceived as not respecting the ex's current stance after a breakup.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect that when a relationship ends, certain mutual obligations that were part of the relationship might not continue. However, if the agreement was clear and both parties understood it as a binding promise, the author might feel justified. But in many cases, especially after a breakup, people might not expect such arrangements to remain in place without a formal agreement.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's position might not be entirely in the wrong from a moral standpoint if they believe the agreement was clear and mutual. However, legally, they might not have a strong case due to the lack of a written contract. The ex's refusal could be based on the end of the relationship, and the author's persistence might be seen as not respecting that boundary. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B), but there are nuances depending on context and legal specifics. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong\" generally, it's a bit subjective. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often values social norms and mutual respect. So, if the author is pushing for a verbal agreement from a past relationship, that might be seen as the author being in the wrong (A), because expecting such an agreement to hold after a breakup without a formal contract could be considered unreasonable. The key is the enforceability and the social expectation post-breakup.\n"
