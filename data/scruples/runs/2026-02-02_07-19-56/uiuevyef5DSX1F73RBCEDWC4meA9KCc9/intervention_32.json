I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex couple who had an agreement where one paid for the other's school while the other worked. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to uphold the agreement, but the ex is being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written, so that's a key point. Verbal agreements can be hard to enforce legally. The author might believe they're entitled to the payment, but since there's no contract, it's more of a moral obligation. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The ex is upset, maybe because rehashing the agreement is painful or they feel pressured after the breakup. The author approached the conversation when they were in a good place, but the ex reacted negatively. The author is trying to reason calmly, but it's not working. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author is asking for what they believe is a fair agreement, but the ex might feel that once the relationship ended, the agreement is no longer valid. Also, the author is contacting the ex for this purpose, which some might see as using the ex for financial gain post-breakup. \n\nIn relationships, expectations can be blurry. Maybe the agreement was based on the assumption that they'd be together, and now that they're not, the ex doesn't want to be tied to that. The author might be expecting accountability, but in reality, the ex isn't obligated. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the author is not necessarily in the wrong, but their approach might need to be more understanding. However, the main issue is the enforceability of the agreement. Without a written contract, it's more about ethics than legality. The author could be seen as holding the ex to an informal promise, which might be reasonable, but the ex's refusal is also valid if they don't want to fulfill it now. \n\nI think the author's stance is reasonable, but the ex's reaction is also understandable. The author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
