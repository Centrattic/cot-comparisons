I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to an agreement made during their relationship. The situation is that they had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's school once he got a job after finishing school. The ex is now being hostile when the author brings it up, and there's no written agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical and legal aspects here. Legally, verbal agreements can be binding, but proving them can be hard, especially if there's no evidence like emails or witnesses. The author's ex might feel that the agreement is no longer valid since they're not together anymore. But the author believes the ex should still honor the agreement regardless of their current relationship status.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author might feel it's right to expect the ex to follow through on a promise. However, considering that the agreement was part of a romantic relationship, which can involve emotional and unequal power dynamics, it's possible the ex might feel pressured or that the terms were unfair. Relationships can change people's perspectives, so after a breakup, someone might reevaluate past agreements.\n\nThe key points are the lack of a written agreement and the ex's hostility. The author's actions are based on a verbal agreement, which can be hard to enforce. The ex might feel that the agreement is tied to the relationship and that it's invalid now. The author might be in a morally right position by expecting accountability, but there's a gray area because the agreement was made in a context that's no longer valid. The ex's reaction could be due to the emotional weight of the situation, not just the financial aspect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. Legally, without proof, it's hard to say. Ethically, if the agreement was mutual and fair at the time, the author might have a point. But since the relationship ended, and the ex is no longer willing to honor it, the author's insistence could be seen as holding onto something that was part of a past relationship. The answer might depend on whether the agreement was considered a personal commitment or a formal contract. Given that, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but the situation is complex. The answer is likely B (No), as the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the ex's refusal is also understandable given the circumstances.\n"
