I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an ex couple who had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's school once he got a job, after the author supported him while he was in school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's a legal obligation here. Since there's no written agreement, legally, it might be hard to enforce. Oral agreements can be tricky because they're hard to prove. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for expecting the ex to honor the agreement. The ex is now being hostile. The key points are: the agreement was mutual, the author supported the ex while he studied, and now the ex is refusing to pay. The author feels they're not wrong for holding the ex to the agreement.\n\nPossible angles: Was the agreement clear and mutual? If both parties understood and agreed, then the author isn't wrong to expect it. But relationships can have complexities. Maybe the ex feels the agreement was part of the relationship and is void now that they're separated. Also, could there be any implied conditions that changed? Like, maybe the agreement was contingent on staying together?\n\nBut the author mentions there's no written agreement, so it's hard to prove. However, the author isn't asking for legal action, just trying to get the ex to honor the verbal agreement. The author's actions here are about expecting someone to keep a promise, which is a moral stance.\n\nOn the other hand, after a breakup, people might feel that personal agreements from the relationship are no longer binding. The ex might be using the breakup as a reason to renege. But if the agreement was separate from the relationship dynamics, maybe the author is justified.\n\nAnother thought: Did the author's actions during the relationship (supporting the ex) imply a mutual understanding? The author covered the ex's costs under the agreement, so there's an expectation. The ex's hostility might be because he feels the relationship's end changes things, but the author is just asking for the agreed-upon support now.\n\nIn summary, without a legal contract, it's more about moral obligation. The author isn't wrong for expecting the ex to keep the promise, especially if it was a mutual agreement. The ex might be wrong for reneging. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
