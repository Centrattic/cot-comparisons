I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex-couple who had an agreement where one supported the other while they went to school, and in return, the ex would pay for the other's education once employed. Now, the ex is refusing to honor the agreement, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The main points here are the existence of the agreement, the nature of the relationship, and the enforceability of the agreement. \n\nThe key issue is whether a verbal agreement between two people in a romantic relationship is legally binding. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be enforceable if certain elements are present, like offer, acceptance, consideration, and an intention to create legal relations. However, in personal relationships, especially romantic ones, there's often an assumption that agreements are not meant to be legally binding. Courts might be skeptical of enforcing such agreements unless there's clear evidence of a mutual intent to create legal obligations.\n\nThe author is now trying to hold the ex to this agreement after the relationship has ended. But since it's a verbal agreement and there's no written contract, the ex can easily deny or dispute the terms. The author's insistence might come across as using the agreement to maintain some control or to get something out of the ex post-breakup, which could be seen as taking advantage of the past relationship. \n\nAlso, relationships can be complex, and agreements made during them might be influenced by the emotional dynamics at the time. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling that the author is bringing up the agreement to rehash the past or to pressure them, even if the author's intention was to seek what they believe is a fair outcome. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the agreement was clear and mutual at the time, the author might feel justified. But in reality, without legal enforceability, it's more of a moral or ethical obligation rather than a legal one. The author's actions could be seen as holding a grudge or trying to extract something after the relationship has ended, which might not be fair, especially if the ex is no longer in a position to honor it or if the agreement was part of the relationship's terms that ended with the relationship.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical aspects, the author might be in the wrong because they are trying to enforce an informal agreement that lacks legal standing and might be exploiting the past relationship. The answer would be A for Yes.\n"
