I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex-couple who had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's education after he got a job. Now they're separated and the author is trying to get him to honor the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the existence of the agreement and whether it's enforceable. The user mentioned there's no written agreement, which is important because verbal agreements can be hard to prove. \n\nThe author is reaching out to discuss the agreement, and the ex is getting hostile. The author feels they should be paid back, but the ex says the agreement means \"shit now.\" So the question is: does the author have a valid claim, or are they wrong to hold the ex to this?\n\nIn many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding if there's consideration (something of value exchanged). Here, the author worked while the ex went to school, so there's an exchange of services for future payment. However, without a written agreement, it's tough to enforce, especially if one party denies it ever existed. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, if both parties agreed at the time, the author might feel they're justified in asking. However, once the relationship is over, the ex might not want to honor it, and the author might be seen as pressuring them. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, it's a gray area because of the lack of written proof. Morally, it depends on whether the agreement was mutual and fair. But the author is trying to enforce a past agreement after the relationship has ended, which some might see as expecting something from a past commitment. The ex's hostility could be because the author is bringing up an old topic during a time when they're supposed to be moving on. \n\nI think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. They had an agreement and are trying to hold up their end. But the ex is not obligated to follow through, especially without a written contract. However, the author might be approaching it the wrong way by being persistent and expecting payment, which could be seen as inconsiderate of the ex's current situation. But the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding to the agreement. Since there was a mutual agreement, even if verbal, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But the situation is complex. So I'll go with B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
