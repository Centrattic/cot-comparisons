I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the man agreed to pay for the woman's school after he got a job, in exchange for her supporting him while he was in school. Now they're separated, and the woman is trying to get him to honor that agreement, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since there was no written contract, it's a verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce. The key factors here would be whether there was a clear mutual understanding, consideration (something of value exchanged between the parties), and an intention to create legal relations. However, in personal relationships, especially romantic ones, courts might be less likely to enforce such agreements unless there's strong evidence of a binding contract.\n\nThe author is now contacting her ex to get him to pay for her tuition. After the breakup, he's refusing, which she finds unfair. The question is whether she's in the wrong for holding him to the agreement. \n\nOn one hand, she's arguing that there was a clear agreement, and he benefited from her financial support. She's trying to enforce it. On the other hand, once the relationship ended, the context changed. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship, which is now over, and he's not obligated. Also, without a written contract, proving the terms could be difficult if it goes to court. \n\nMoral vs. legal aspects: Legally, without a contract, it's a gray area. Morally, some might say she's justified if there was a mutual understanding. Others might say that after a breakup, expecting payment from a former partner is unreasonable, especially if the agreement was informal. \n\nThe ex's hostility might stem from feeling that the issue is being brought up after the relationship ended, which he might see as holding a grudge or trying to extract money now that she's in a better position. The author's actions could be seen as trying to enforce a moral obligation rather than a legal one. \n\nConsidering all that, even if there was a mutual understanding, the absence of a written agreement makes it hard to enforce legally. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship dynamics and not a formal contract. The author's persistence could be seen as reasonable if they both believed in the agreement, but others might think she's overstepping by expecting payment after the breakup. \n\nSo, whether she's in the wrong depends on the perspective. Legally, probably not enforceable. Morally, some might side with her if the agreement was clear. Others might say that after a breakup, such expectations should be dropped. Since the user asked if the author is in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) if the focus is on the enforceability and the context of the broken relationship, or B (no) if the focus is on the existence of a mutual agreement. However, given that the agreement was verbal and part of a personal relationship, the author might be overreaching, making her the one in the wrong.\n"
