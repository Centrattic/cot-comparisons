I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA, \"Am I the Asshole\") is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex and the author had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex gets a job, he would pay for the author's school. Now that the ex is employed, the author is asking him to honor the agreement, but the ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The agreement between the two was mutual, but it's not written down. The ex is now in a job, and the author is trying to get them to pay for their education. The ex is upset and says the agreement means nothing now. The author is arguing that they upheld their part by supporting the ex during their schooling, so the ex should now fulfill their end.\n\nLegally, without a written contract, this might be hard to enforce. In many places, verbal agreements can be tricky, especially in personal relationships. Courts usually require more evidence for verbal agreements, and they might not be enforceable in some cases. So legally, the author might not have a strong case here.\n\nBut the question isn't just legal; it's about moral or ethical rightness. The author feels that the ex should keep their word regardless of the relationship status. The ex, on the other hand, is no longer in the relationship and is now hostile to the agreement. The author's approach is to continue arguing, but the ex is resistant.\n\nMoral perspective: Some might say that the author is in the right because they kept their end of the bargain, and the ex should do the same. Others might argue that once the relationship ended, the agreement is no longer binding, especially if it's not written. Relationships can change, and expectations might shift when they're no longer in a romantic context. The ex might feel that since they're not together anymore, there's no obligation to follow through.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to support their education in exchange for the ex's future support. That's a fair agreement, but the problem is that in the absence of a formal contract, the ex is free to walk away. The author is trying to hold them to an informal agreement, which may not be realistic. The ex's hostility could stem from the fact that they're now in a different place in their life and don't want to be bound by past commitments, especially in a former relationship.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author make this agreement clear and mutual? If both parties understood and agreed to the terms at the time, then the author's expectation is valid. But without a written agreement, proving that there was an agreement could be difficult. The ex might claim that the agreement was never real or was just a passing conversation.\n\nAlso, the author is reaching out after minimal contact, which the ex might see as a breach of their agreed space. The author's approach of starting with a friendly check-in before bringing up the agreement could be seen as genuine, but the ex's reaction suggests they might feel this is a setup or a trap to bring up the agreement again.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the ex to keep their word, but the problem is the ex's unwillingness to do so. However, from a practical standpoint, the author is in a difficult position because they can't enforce the agreement legally. So while the author's position is understandable, the ex's refusal might be based on their own circumstances or a change of heart. \n\nThe AITA community often considers whether the person is being unreasonably expecting something that's not legally or socially enforceable. In this case, the author is holding the ex to a verbal agreement, which many might see as expecting too much, especially after a breakup. So, the community might side that the author is a bit in the wrong for not realizing that the agreement isn't binding once the relationship is over, even if it was mutual at the time. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, it could be B if it's seen that the author had a valid expectation. However, in many AITA scenarios, unenforceable verbal agreements after a breakup are considered not to be the author's fault, but the ex's. Wait, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was mutual and the ex is now breaking it, then the author isn't in the wrong for expecting it. However, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that without a written agreement, the ex isn't obligated, and trying to enforce it might be unreasonable. \n\nIn AITA threads, the consensus often is that if there's no written agreement, the person expecting payment is the one in the right if the agreement was mutual, but the other person's refusal is the problem. However, sometimes the community might say that the author is in the wrong because they relied on a verbal agreement. But I think in this case, since the agreement was mutual and both parties understood it, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is the one in the wrong for not keeping their word. However, the author's insistence after the breakup might be seen as harassment if they're not giving the ex space, but the user mentioned minimal contact, so maybe not. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit split here. But legally, the author can't force the ex to pay without proof. But morally, the author is in the right for expecting the ex to keep their promise. However, the AITA question is about whether the author is in the wrong. So if the author is in the right, then answer is B. But if the author is being unreasonable, answer is A. \n\nThe key points: mutual agreement, no written contract, ex is refusing. The author is trying to hold the ex to the agreement. The ex is hostile. The author isn't asking for anything beyond what was agreed, just asking for tuition payment. \n\nIn AITA, usually, if someone is trying to enforce a mutual verbal agreement, they aren't considered the asshole. The ex is the one who's not keeping their word. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any aspect where the author is in the wrong. For example, if the agreement was made under duress or if there's a power imbalance. But the story doesn't mention that. The agreement was mutual. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong; the ex is. So the answer is B.\n"
