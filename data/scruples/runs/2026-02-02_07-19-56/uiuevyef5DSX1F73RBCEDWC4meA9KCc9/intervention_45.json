I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex expecting the other to honor a verbal agreement where they paid for the ex's school while the ex was in school, and now the ex is supposed to pay for the author's education after completing their own schooling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written. That's a key point because verbal agreements can be tricky in terms of enforceability. Without a written contract, it's hard to prove the exact terms, especially if one party denies or claims the agreement was different. The author is now reaching out to their ex to discuss this, but the ex is hostile and refusing to honor it. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I should analyze both sides. The author might believe they were entitled to the payment based on the agreement. However, after a breakup, the ex might feel that the relationship's responsibilities have ended, and they don't want to be bound by old agreements. The initial agreement was based on their being a couple, so if they broke up, maybe the ex is no longer willing to fulfill that part. \n\nAlso, the timing matters. The author reached out while maintaining minimal contact for healing. Bringing up financial matters in a breakup context can be sensitive. Even if the author was trying to be polite by starting with how they're doing, the ex might have felt it was a setup or felt pressured. The author's persistence might be seen as holding a grudge or trying to control the ex's post-breakup life.\n\nAnother angle is the assumption of mutual consent. The ex might have agreed under the context of the relationship, thinking it would be a temporary arrangement. Now that they're separated, the ex may not feel obligated. The author might not have considered that the ex's situation has changed, or perhaps the ex's financial ability to fulfill the agreement is different now.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the author right to expect an ex to follow through on a past verbal agreement? Some might say yes, if there was a clear understanding. Others might argue that once the relationship ends, such informal agreements aren't binding. The author's argument is that the ex should keep their word regardless of the relationship status, but the ex is arguing the opposite.\n\nLegally, a verbal agreement can be enforceable, but it's often difficult to prove. The lack of a written document might leave the author without legal recourse. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author might have a valid claim based on the agreement, but the ex's refusal could stem from the breakup and not wanting to be tied financially.\n\nSo, the user is asking for an AITA opinion. The answer depends on whether the agreement is considered a binding promise or if the breakup nullifies it. If the agreement was part of the relationship's terms and the ex is now unwilling, the author might be overstepping by expecting it post-breakup. The ex's hostility could be because they feel the author is reopening old wounds or using the agreement to guilt-trip them. The author's approach might not be respectful of the ex's current stance, even if they believe the agreement was fair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by insisting on the agreement after the relationship ended, especially without a written contract.\n"
