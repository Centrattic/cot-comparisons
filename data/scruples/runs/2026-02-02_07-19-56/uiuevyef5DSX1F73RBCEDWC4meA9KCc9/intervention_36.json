I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves an ex-couple who had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and the ex promised to pay for the author's school once they were employed. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and getting hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since it wasn't written, it's a verbal agreement. Legally, verbal agreements can be binding, but they're often harder to enforce, especially if there's no tangible proof. The author is probably right that without a written contract, it's tough to take legal action. But the question isn't about legalities; it's about whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex should honor the agreement regardless of their current relationship status. They started by checking in and then brought up the agreement when things seemed to go well. The ex became hostile, maybe interpreting the conversation as pressure. The author is persisting, arguing calmly but not getting far.\n\nNow, considering the perspective of the ex: after a breakup, the ex might be resistant to any obligations from the past relationship. Even if there was an agreement, once the relationship ended, the ex might feel it's no longer binding. People do break up and move on, and sometimes past financial agreements are left behind. Plus, the author was supporting the ex during their schooling without expecting immediate payment, which could be seen as a gesture of goodwill rather than a strict contract. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid point about keeping promises. If both parties agreed on mutual support with the understanding that it's a reciprocal arrangement, then the author is justified in expecting their part to be honored. However, the key issue here is that there's no written proof. In many cases, people rely on verbal agreements in relationships, but once emotions are involved, especially after a breakup, those agreements can be perceived differently. The author might be clinging to something that was always contingent on the relationship continuing, which might not hold up once it's over.\n\nThe author's actions include reaching out after minimal contact, which could be seen as pushing the issue too soon. Even though they started with a friendly check-in, the ex's hostility suggests that bringing up the agreement was unwelcome. The author might not be considering the ex's perspective, that the relationship is over, and both parties are supposed to move on. Insisting on the agreement might be unfair, especially if the ex feels it's part of the past.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored, the way they're approaching it might be problematic. The lack of a written contract makes it hard to enforce, and the ex might not feel obligated anymore. The author's persistence could be seen as holding onto a past commitment that was part of a relationship that no longer exists. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not recognizing that the breakup changes the dynamics of their agreement.\n"
