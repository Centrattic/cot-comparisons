I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves an ex-couple with an agreement where one worked while the other went to school, and upon graduation, the latter would pay for the former's education.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written. That's important because verbal agreements can be harder to enforce legally. But the question isn't just about legal enforceability; it's about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nThe author is trying to hold the ex to the agreement, which they feel was mutual. The ex is now refusing, saying the agreement \"means shit now.\" The user is asking if the author is wrong for continuing to pursue this payment.\n\nPossible angles: \n\n1. **Verbal agreements and enforceability**: Legally, verbal agreements can be binding, but it's harder to prove terms and expectations. Without a written contract, it's a matter of testimony. But the question isn't about legal recourse but moral rightness.\n\n2. **Expectations in a relationship**: The agreement was made during a dating relationship. Sometimes, people in personal relationships make promises that aren't meant to be legally binding but are based on trust and mutual support. If the relationship ended, does that negate the agreement? Or does the agreement still stand as a personal promise?\n\n3. **Assumptions and fairness**: The author assumes the agreement was clear and binding. The ex might feel differently, especially after the breakup. The author might be in the right if the agreement was mutual and based on trust. However, the ex might feel that the breakup changes things, and they're not obligated anymore.\n\n4. **Communication and approach**: The author reached out after a period of minimal contact, starting with a friendly tone before bringing up the agreement. The ex became hostile, possibly interpreting the conversation as an attempt to reconnect rather than discuss the agreement. The author's approach might be seen as trying to catch the ex off guard, which could affect perceived fairness.\n\n5. **Emotional vs. logical perspective**: The author is acting on the belief that the ex should honor their word. The ex might feel it's a deadbeat situation, especially if the relationship ended amicably but the agreement is now a point of contention. The author's persistence might be seen as reasonable or as harassment depending on the context.\n\nConsidering all this, the key points are the nature of the verbal agreement, the context of a former relationship, and how each party perceives their obligations. Since there's no legal binding, it's more about moral obligation. If the agreement was clear and mutual, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the ex's refusal after the breakup might indicate that they never intended it to be binding or that circumstances changed. The author's insistence could be seen as holding someone to a past promise after a breakup, which some might view as unfair. \n\nBut without a written agreement, it's a gray area. The author is acting on their understanding of the agreement, while the ex is dismissing it. Legally, the author might not be able to force payment, but morally, the answer is subjective. The question is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was mutual and the ex is refusing without just cause, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the agreement was more of a mutual understanding that both parties now see differently, the author might be overstepping. \n\nThe answer likely depends on cultural or personal norms about verbal agreements in relationships. In many cases, people might agree that once the relationship is over, such agreements are no longer enforceable, especially if not in writing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the ex to honor a verbal agreement post-breakup, especially if the ex is unwilling. However, others might argue that promises should be kept regardless of the relationship status. \n\nGiven the way the question is framed, the majority opinion might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because verbal agreements in personal relationships are often seen as less binding, especially post-breakup. The ex's refusal is a sign that the agreement isn't valid anymore, and the author is holding onto a past promise that isn't enforceable.\n"
