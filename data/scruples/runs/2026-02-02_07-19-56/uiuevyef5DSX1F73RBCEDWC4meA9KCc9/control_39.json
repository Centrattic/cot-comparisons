I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an agreement between an ex-couple where the woman worked while the man went to school, and he was supposed to pay for her education once he got a job. Now that they're separated, she's asking him to uphold the agreement, but he's refusing and getting hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author (the woman) is in the wrong. The key points here are about the existence of the agreement and whether it's enforceable now that they're no longer together. The user wants a simple answer: A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong). \n\nThe agreement they had was verbal, not written. In many legal systems, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're often harder to prove. However, the enforceability can depend on various factors like the subject matter and local laws. But this isn't a legal question in the sense of court enforcement, but more about moral or social responsibility.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if both parties agreed to the terms while in a relationship, the question is whether the agreement still stands post-breakup. Relationships can dissolve, and agreements made within that context might not survive the end of the relationship. The man might feel that since they're no longer together, the agreement is void. The woman, however, believes that promises should be kept regardless of the relationship status.\n\nAnother angle is emotional and social. The woman might be using this to maintain some connection or leverage, which could be seen as manipulative. But she claims she's just holding him to a prior agreement. The man's hostility might stem from feeling pressured or that the agreement was part of their past relationship and shouldn't bind him now.\n\nAlso, the lack of a written agreement complicates things. Without documentation, it's open to interpretation. The woman might believe she's entitled to the tuition, while the man might argue that the agreement was conditional on the relationship continuing.\n\nConsidering all this, the community's typical \"AITA\" responses often look at intent and fairness. If the agreement was made in good faith and both parties understood the terms, then the woman might not be wrong. However, if the man now refuses for valid reasons (like financial inability, or the agreement being part of a mutual arrangement that's no longer viable), then maybe the woman is overreaching. But since the agreement was part of their mutual support during the relationship, it's debatable.\n\nIn most \"AITA\" cases, if someone is trying to enforce a verbal agreement without written proof and the other party refuses, the community often sides against the person making the claim, as verbal agreements can be subjective and it's seen as using the past relationship to demand something now. However, if the agreement was clear and both parties benefited, some might see it as fair.\n\nBut given that they're no longer together, expecting someone to honor a past agreement without legal binding could be seen as unreasonable. The man might feel that the agreement is null now that the relationship is over. The woman's persistence might be seen as holding a grudge or trying to get something from the ex, which can make the community think she's the asshole.\n\nSo, leaning towards A (author is in the wrong) because enforcing a verbal agreement from a past relationship without written proof, especially after a breakup, is often viewed as unfair. The agreement was part of their mutual arrangement while together, and once the relationship ends, those terms might not be enforceable, especially without a written contract. The woman is now trying to use the past to extract financial support, which could be seen as the asshole move.\n"
