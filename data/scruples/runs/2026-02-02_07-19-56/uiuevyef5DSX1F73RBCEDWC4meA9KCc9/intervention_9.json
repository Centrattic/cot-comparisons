I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an agreement between an ex-couple where the ex was supposed to pay for the author's education after finishing school. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The agreement was verbal, not written. The user's reasoning is that since the ex benefited from their financial support during their studies, they expect the ex to follow through. But there's no legal contract here. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they're hard to enforce without proof. \n\nThe author is reaching out to discuss the agreement after minimal contact, which might have been a mistake. The ex became hostile, possibly interpreting the conversation as an attempt to rekindle the relationship or expecting something more. The author's argument is that the ex should keep the word, but without a written agreement, it's more about moral obligation than legal necessity. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the enforceability of a verbal agreement. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving the terms and conditions can be difficult. The author might be right in expecting the ex to follow through, but the ex might not see it that way anymore, especially after the relationship ended. \n\nAlso, the way the author approached the conversation could have contributed to the ex's hostility. Starting with friendly small talk before bringing up the agreement might have been a good move, but the ex might have felt ambushed or thought the author was trying to reconnect. \n\nThe author's persistence in arguing could be seen as reasonable if there was a clear understanding, but since it's verbal, the ex might not agree on the terms. The author's assumption that the ex must honor the agreement without a written proof could be the point where they're in the wrong. They might be overestimating the binding nature of a verbal agreement in a past relationship. \n\nOn the other side, the ex's hostility could be due to the emotional aspect of the situation. Maybe they feel that the author is trying to maintain a connection or that the agreement is no longer fair now that their circumstances have changed. The ex might not be in the wrong in refusing to pay if they don't acknowledge the agreement's validity. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's insistence on the verbal agreement without any written evidence might make them at least partially in the wrong. The ex isn't obligated to follow through if they don't agree on the terms, and the author's approach could have been tactless. But the author's initial reasoning might have some merit if the agreement was clear. However, the lack of a written proof makes it hard to enforce, leading to the author possibly being in the wrong for expecting it now.\n"
