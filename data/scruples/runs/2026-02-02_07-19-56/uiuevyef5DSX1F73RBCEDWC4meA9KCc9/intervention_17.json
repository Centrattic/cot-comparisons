I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement where the ex promised to pay for their school after graduating. The situation is that they had an informal agreement, no written contract, and the ex is now refusing to honor it. The author is trying to get the ex to pay up, but the ex is being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be legally binding in many places, but they're hard to enforce without proof. Without a written contract, it's difficult for the author to make a legal claim. So, from a legal standpoint, the author might not have a strong case. \n\nThen there's the moral or ethical angle. The author feels the ex should keep their word, which makes sense. But relationships are complex, and when things end, people's perspectives can change. The ex might be feeling that the situation has changed, or maybe they had a different understanding of the agreement. The author's insistence might be seen as holding a grudge or not respecting the breakup. \n\nThe author's approach: contacting the ex during a time of minimal contact, using the conversation opener and then bringing up the agreement. The ex's hostility could stem from feeling that the author is reopening old wounds or not respecting their space. The author's continued attempts to argue might be perceived as pushy, even if they believe they're in the right.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical sides: Legally, the author is in a weak position, but ethically, it's a gray area. The ex might have made a promise, but circumstances have changed. The author's actions could be seen as unreasonable if the ex is no longer in a position to fulfill the agreement or if the agreement was part of a mutual, now-ended relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to get a promise honored, which is understandable. However, the lack of a written agreement complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong morally, but they might not be in a strong position to enforce it. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's accurate. The key points are the existence of the agreement, the lack of written proof, and the current relationship status. The author's actions could be seen as holding the ex to a past promise without considering the ex's current stance or the dissolution of the relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily morally wrong for believing the agreement should be honored, they might be in the wrong in terms of practicality and the ex's perspective, especially since the ex is now unwilling to comply. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the agreement is verbal, and the author is persisting despite the ex's hostility, which could be seen as not respecting the ex's current wishes.\n"
