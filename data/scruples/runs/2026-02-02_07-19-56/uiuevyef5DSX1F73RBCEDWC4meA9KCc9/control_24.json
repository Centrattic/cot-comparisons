I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between them and their ex. Let me break it down.\n\nThey had an understanding where the author worked while the ex went to school, and after the ex got a job, he would pay for the author's education. Now, the ex is saying the agreement means nothing. The author is trying to get him to honor it, but the ex became hostile during the conversation. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I should consider if an agreement like this is legally binding. Since there's no written contract, it's probably just a verbal agreement. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. They might hold up in court under certain conditions, but it's hard to prove without evidence. However, the author is talking about moral obligation, not necessarily legal action. So maybe they feel the ex should keep his word for ethical reasons.\n\nNext, the context of the agreement. It was made during their dating relationship. People often make promises in relationships that aren't formal. The author contributed by working, and the ex was in school, with the understanding that he would pay for the author's school once he could. The problem is that they're no longer together, and the ex is refusing.\n\nThe author reached out to discuss the agreement, starting with friendly conversation, but the ex reacted negatively. The author argues that they should keep their word regardless of the relationship status. The ex might feel that the agreement is tied to their relationship, which is now over, so he's not obligated anymore. But the author thinks that since the agreement was made, it's still valid.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the ex might be right if the agreement was conditional on the relationship continuing. If the author expected the ex to pay after the relationship ended, that might not be reasonable. However, if the agreement was explicit and the ex is breaking it without a good reason, the author might be justified in pursuing it.\n\nBut since there's no written proof, it's hard to enforce. The author is now contacting the ex, which the ex might see as intrusive or a violation of their agreed minimal contact. The ex's hostility could be because he feels pressured or that the author is using the agreement to reopen the relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might say that when a relationship ends, past promises\u2014especially those made in the context of a romantic relationship\u2014aren't binding. Others might argue that if both parties acted on the agreement (the author worked, the ex went to school), then it's fair to expect the ex to follow through once he's employed.\n\nHowever, the author is bringing it up after the relationship has ended, which could be seen as holding onto resentment or trying to maintain a connection. The ex might perceive this as the author still being emotionally attached or using the agreement to keep up contact. That could make the author in the wrong if they're violating the mutual agreement to have minimal contact.\n\nBut the author mentions they were just having a friendly conversation and the ex became hostile. Maybe the ex is unwilling to discuss it, so the author is just trying to get a fair outcome. The author isn't asking to live together but for tuition payment, which is a specific financial matter.\n\nOverall, the key points are: 1) Verbal agreement during a relationship, 2) No written proof, 3) Ex is now hostile and claims the agreement is invalid, 4) Author is trying to get it fulfilled post-breakup.\n\nIt's a gray area. Legally, the author might not have a strong case. Morally, it depends on the terms of the agreement. If the agreement was clear and the ex is the one who didn't follow through, the author might not be wrong. But if the agreement was part of the relationship's dynamic and the ex feels it's not applicable now, the author might be overreaching. Also, if the minimal contact was agreed upon, the author's insistence on discussing it could be seen as violating that. However, if the agreement was mutual and the author is just seeking what was promised, they might not be in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), especially if the agreement was mutual and the ex is refusing without cause. But it's complicated because relationships can change the nature of agreements. However, the ex's hostility and the lack of written agreement might mean the author is right to seek payment, even if it's not legally enforceable. The community on AITA would likely say the ex is being unreasonable, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
