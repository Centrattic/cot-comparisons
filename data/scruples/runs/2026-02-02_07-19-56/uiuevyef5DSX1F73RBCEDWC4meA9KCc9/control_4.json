I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the woman worked while the man went to school, and he was supposed to pay her way through school once he got a job. Now, after the breakup, she's trying to get him to honor that agreement, but he's being hostile.\n\nFirst, I should think about the nature of the agreement. They didn't have a written contract, just an oral agreement. In legal terms, an oral agreement can be enforceable, but it's often harder to prove. However, this is a personal relationship, not a business contract, so maybe the expectations were more about mutual trust and less about formal legal terms.\n\nThe woman is arguing that since they had an agreement, he should still honor it even after the breakup. She's approached him politely, starting with small talk before bringing up the topic, and he reacted hostility. The man is now saying the agreement means nothing now, maybe because they're no longer together. \n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. Legally, without a written agreement, it might be tough to enforce. But morally or ethically, is she wrong? She's asking him to keep his word. But relationships can change, and agreements made in the context of a romantic relationship might not hold the same weight after a breakup. The man might feel that the agreement was part of their relationship dynamics, and now that they're separated, he's not obligated. \n\nOn the other hand, the woman might believe that promises made during the relationship still hold, especially if she provided support during his schooling. But did she have any legal recourse? Without a written contract, it's a tough case. Some might say that in a romantic context, such agreements are more about mutual support and not binding, so once the relationship ends, the obligation might not be expected. \n\nThe key points here are the existence of a binding agreement, the context of a romantic relationship, and the expectations post-breakup. The woman might feel entitled, but the man might feel the agreement was part of their shared life together. If they broke up, maybe he's not required to follow through. However, if she relied on that promise to defer her education or incurred debts, there could be arguments for her position. \n\nBut since there's no written proof, the man can easily deny the agreement. The woman's actions might be seen as trying to extract money from him after the relationship ended, which could be perceived as unfair. Alternatively, if the agreement was mutual and clear, she might be right. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering that the agreement wasn't written and was made in the context of a personal relationship, it's possible that the author is in the wrong because the man isn't legally obligated, and their relationship has ended. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the other way around because keeping promises is important. Hmm.\n"
