I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they were in a relationship where they had an agreement: the author worked while the ex went to school, and upon graduating and getting a job, the ex would pay for the author's education. Now that they're no longer together, the author is asking the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile and saying the agreement means \"shit now.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider if such an agreement is enforceable. The user mentioned there's no written contract, just a verbal agreement. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're often harder to prove. However, the question isn't just about legal standing but also about moral or ethical responsibility.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they upheld their end by working and supporting the ex while he studied. The ex's part was to pay for the author's schooling once he was employed. The author feels entitled to this payment because of the agreement. The ex, on the other hand, is now rejecting the agreement, possibly due to the relationship ending. \n\nNow, the key points here are the nature of the agreement and the intent behind it. If the agreement was made in the context of a romantic relationship, it's possible that it was based on mutual trust and expectations rather than a formal legal contract. When a relationship ends, sometimes people re-evaluate promises made in that context. But the author argues that the agreement is still valid regardless of their current status.\n\nAnother angle is whether the ex's refusal is a matter of changing priorities or if the author is being unreasonable. The author is reaching out in a calm and friendly manner after a period of minimal contact, which seems appropriate. The ex's hostility might indicate that he's uncomfortable with the request now that they're separated, perhaps feeling that the relationship dynamics have changed, making the agreement less binding.\n\nHowever, the author's argument is that the agreement was clear and that they fulfilled their part. The ex's part was a future obligation once he was employed. The author isn't asking for anything beyond what was agreed\u2014just tuition costs. The question is whether the ex is morally obligated to follow through, even without a written contract.\n\nIn many cases, when a relationship ends, people might expect that personal agreements made during the relationship might not be honored, especially if they're not formal. But from a fairness standpoint, if the agreement was mutual and both parties acted on it (the author working, the ex attending school), then the ex might be expected to honor it. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of past relationships. Sometimes, when people break up, they want to cut ties, and financial obligations can complicate that. The ex might feel that the agreement is tied to the relationship and that since they're no longer together, the agreement is null and void. However, if the agreement was made outside of the relationship's emotional context, like a mutual understanding that was part of their plans, then the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the agreement was a personal, conditional one based on the relationship's continuation or a more concrete, standalone commitment. Since the author is asking for tuition costs and there's no written proof, the ex might be justifying his refusal by saying the relationship has ended. But the author's point is that the agreement was separate from their romantic status. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the agreement was made with the understanding that it's a mutual promise, then the author is justified in expecting it to be honored. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling that the author is holding past promises against him now that they're separated, but that doesn't make the author wrong. Alternatively, if the agreement was implicitly conditional on the relationship continuing, then maybe the author is overreaching. But since the ex was supposed to pay after getting employed, regardless of the relationship status, the author's stance could be reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're asking for a promise to be honored, and the ex's refusal is more about the relationship ending than the validity of the agreement. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author isn't asking to live with the ex, just the tuition. If the ex is now in a better position to help and the agreement was clear, the author's claim is understandable. The ex's reaction is the problem here, not the author's request. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
