I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The couple had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and in return, the ex would pay for the author's school once employed. They're no longer together, and the author is now asking for the tuition payment. The ex became hostile and said the agreement means nothing now. There's no written contract, just a verbal agreement.\n\nNow, considering the legal aspect: Verbal agreements can be tricky. While they can be legally binding, they're hard to enforce without proof, especially in emotional contexts like relationships. The author is holding the ex to a verbal agreement, which might not hold up in court. The ex might feel that since the relationship ended, the agreement is no longer valid. \n\nEthically, it's about expectations. The author believed in the agreement and acted on it by working and supporting the ex. The ex might feel that after the breakup, the personal obligation doesn't continue. The author might be seen as being reasonable in expecting the commitment to stand, but others might argue that the breakup changes the dynamics, and personal promises shouldn't be forced after a relationship ends. \n\nAlso, the tone of the author's approach matters. They tried to discuss it calmly after a period of minimal contact, but the ex reacted negatively. The author's persistence might be perceived as pushy, especially if the ex is emotionally detached now.\n\nSo, legally, the author might not have a strong case. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author's argument is based on trust and mutual understanding during the relationship, but the ex might not feel bound by it post-breakup. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on societal expectations. Some might say the author is justified in expecting the agreement to be honored, while others might say that personal agreements in relationships can't be enforced after separation.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to decide based on the reasoning. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they believed in the agreement and acted on it. However, the lack of a written contract is a problem. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling that the author is holding onto the past or expecting something that's no longer relevant. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), but there are valid points on both sides. The main issue is the lack of enforceability of the verbal agreement and the emotional aspect of the breakup.\n"
