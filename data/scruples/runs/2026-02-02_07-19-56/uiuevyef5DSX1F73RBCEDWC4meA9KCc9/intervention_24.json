I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an agreement between an ex-couple where one paid for the other's school while they worked, with the understanding that once the other got a job, they'd pay for the first person's education.\n\nSo, the key points here are: there was an agreement, but it's not written. The ex is now refusing to honor it after the breakup. The author is trying to hold the ex to this verbal agreement, which the ex is dismissing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, legal perspective: verbal agreements can be enforceable, but they're hard to prove without evidence. Without a written contract, it's more about testimony and credibility. If the ex denies the agreement exists, the author might have trouble getting a court to enforce it. Legally, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored, but practically, they might not have standing to make the ex follow through.\n\nEthically, it's trickier. The agreement was part of their relationship dynamics. Once the relationship ended, the ex isn't morally obligated to continue the agreement, especially if they no longer wish to be in a relationship. The author is treating this as a binding promise, but relationships can change, and so can people's commitments. The author is reaching out after minimal contact, possibly reopening old wounds. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling pressured or reminded of the breakup.\n\nThe author's actions: they're trying to negotiate or enforce the agreement, which is reasonable, but doing so after the relationship has ended and during a healing period might be seen as inconsiderate. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship, which is now over, and thus the terms no longer apply. The author could be seen as not respecting the ex's space and moving on, which the user initially agreed to by having minimal contact.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they covered \"almost everything\" while the ex was in school. If the ex is now in a better position financially, the author's expectation might be seen as reasonable, but if the ex is struggling, it might be unrealistic. There's no mention of the ex's current situation, though.\n\nSo, putting it all together: legally, maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but ethically and practically, they might be pushing for something that was tied to the relationship, which no longer exists. The author's insistence on the agreement after the breakup could be seen as not respecting the closure they both wanted. The ex's hostility might be justified if they feel the agreement is part of the past. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not letting go of the agreement now that the relationship is over.\n"
