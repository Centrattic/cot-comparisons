I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple. The user (the author) and their ex had an understanding where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, they would pay for the author's education. Now, after the relationship ended, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider if verbal agreements in relationships are enforceable. Legally, without a written contract, it can be hard to enforce such agreements. But the question isn't just legal\u2014it's about moral or ethical wrong. So even if the author can't take legal action, is it the right thing to do to hold someone to a verbal agreement after a breakup?\n\nNext, the context: the agreement was during their dating relationship. That complicates things because personal relationships often involve expectations that might not hold up once the relationship is over. The author is now asking for tuition payment, which could be seen as a financial obligation from a past relationship. The ex is upset, possibly because they feel the relationship is over and they don't want any further obligations.\n\nMoral perspective: Did the author have a reasonable expectation that the ex would follow through after the breakup? If the agreement was mutual and clear at the time, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for expecting it. However, once the relationship ended, the ex might see it as a personal matter that's now irrelevant. It's possible that the ex is right in not wanting to be bound by a past agreement without a formal contract.\n\nAlso, the author is trying to discuss it calmly, but the ex is hostile. The ex's reaction might be due to feeling pressured after the breakup. The author's persistence could be seen as holding a grudge or trying to extract money post-breakup, which could be viewed negatively.\n\nAnother angle: The author supported the ex through school, expecting reciprocity. That's a fair expectation in a partnership. However, relationships can change, and agreements made during a relationship might not be binding once it's over. The author might be in the right to ask, but the ex is within their rights to decline without a written agreement.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored, but the ex isn't wrong for refusing either. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, I need to decide if their actions are morally or ethically questionable. Persistently asking for something based on a verbal agreement after a breakup might be seen as unreasonable, especially if the ex is no longer in a romantic relationship and there's no legal recourse. The author's insistence could be seen as holding onto a past commitment that the ex is no longer willing to uphold. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not letting go of the agreement once the relationship ended.\n"
