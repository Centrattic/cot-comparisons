I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement. The situation is that during their relationship, the author worked while the ex went to school, with the understanding that once the ex was employed, he'd pay for the author's education. Now, the ex is being hostile about fulfilling that part.\n\nHmm, first, agreements between people, especially in personal relationships, can be tricky. There's no written contract here, just a verbal one. The key point is whether such an agreement is enforceable. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to prove. So the author's rightness might depend on the legal perspective, but the question is more about moral or ethical standpoint.\n\nThe ex might feel that after the breakup, the agreement no longer has to be honored. But the author thinks that the agreement was a mutual understanding and should stand regardless of the relationship status. It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author supported the ex through school with the expectation of reciprocal support. On the other hand, once the relationship ends, can they still expect the ex to follow through? \n\nI need to consider if the agreement was truly mutual and if there was an exchange of something of value. The author gave financial support by working and covering expenses, which could be seen as consideration. But once they broke up, maybe the ex feels the obligations from the relationship don't apply anymore. However, the author might argue that the agreement was about future obligations (paying tuition after ex's graduation), not just during the relationship.\n\nThe ex's hostility suggests he's not willing to honor it now. The author is trying to discuss it calmly but not getting far. So from a moral angle, is the author justified in expecting payment? Some might say yes, because they kept their part. Others might say that personal relationships can have agreements that dissolve when the relationship ends, especially if there's no legal contract. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't asking to live together, just tuition. If the agreement was clear and both understood it as a binding promise, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if it was more of a conditional support based on the relationship continuing, then after the breakup, the ex might not feel obligated. \n\nSo, legally, it's complicated. Morally, it's about whether the ex's refusal is unjust. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable, just the agreed tuition. The ex's reaction seems harsh, especially if the author fulfilled their part. However, the ex's current stance might be influenced by the breakup, making it hard to see it as a separate agreement. \n\nI think the answer depends on how the agreement was perceived. If it was a mutual, separate agreement outside the relationship's emotional context, the author is right. But if it was part of the relationship's dynamics, the ex might not feel bound. Since the original question is about being in the wrong (moral, not legal), and the author isn't demanding anything beyond what was agreed and isn't living together, maybe the author is not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
