I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement from when they were dating.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user (AITA) and their ex had an agreement where the user worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex was employed, they would pay for the user's education. Now that the ex is employed and the couple is no longer together, the user is asking them to fulfill the agreement. The ex is refusing and being hostile. The user is wondering if they're wrong for continuing to pursue this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the agreement was verbal, there's no written contract, and the ex is now refusing to honor it after the breakup. The user is trying to argue based on the terms they had during the relationship.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but they're harder to prove. Without a written contract, it's going to be tough for the user to make a legal claim. But the question here isn't strictly about legal rights, it's more about whether the author is \"in the wrong\" in the social context of the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics and social norms, when relationships end, people often have lingering obligations. But if the agreement was part of the relationship terms (like a mutual support arrangement during the relationship), does that obligation still exist after the breakup? The user's argument is that the agreement was a reciprocal one, and since they supported the ex while they were in school, the ex should now support them. However, once the relationship ends, some people might view such agreements as part of the past relationship and not binding anymore unless there's a formal agreement.\n\nThe ex's hostility suggests they might see the user's request as a continuation of the relationship in a way that's uncomfortable or unfair now that they're separated. The user's approach might be interpreted as trying to extract a benefit from the past relationship after the breakup, which could be seen as taking advantage, especially without a written agreement.\n\nBut then again, if the agreement was clear and mutual during the relationship, some might argue that the ex should honor it regardless of the breakup. However, the lack of a written contract complicates things. It's a matter of whether the agreement was considered part of the relationship's social contract rather than a formal legal obligation.\n\nIn social terms, the user might be seen as reasonable if they believed the agreement was clear and fair, but others might think that after a breakup, such agreements are no longer binding. The ex's refusal could be based on the desire to move on and not have financial obligations tied to a past relationship. \n\nSo, the answer likely depends on whether the agreement was seen as a personal, mutual commitment during the relationship. If the user is now trying to enforce it after the breakup without a formal contract, they might be in a gray area. The ex's hostility might stem from the user's insistence feeling like a demand post-breakup, which can be perceived as inconsiderate.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user's intention to hold the ex to the agreement isn't inherently wrong, the lack of a written contract and the context of the breakup could mean that the user is overstepping, especially if the ex no longer wants to be bound by past relationship terms. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because without a formal agreement, the ex isn't legally obligated, and socially, it might be seen as expecting a favor to continue after the relationship has ended."
