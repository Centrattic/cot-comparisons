I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement about paying for their education after the ex finishes school. The situation is that the ex is now refusing to honor the deal after they split up. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the nature of the agreement. It was a verbal one made during the relationship. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they aren't legally binding in many cases unless specific conditions are met. The author is trying to enforce it now that the relationship is over, but the ex is resistant. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they supported the ex by working while the ex studied, expecting the ex to pay their tuition once employed. The ex is hostile now, perhaps feeling that the author is bringing up the past unnecessarily or that the agreement isn't valid anymore after the breakup. \n\nLegally, without a written agreement, proving the terms could be difficult. The ex might not be obligated to fulfill the agreement now, especially if the circumstances have changed. The author's insistence on holding the ex to the deal might be seen as expecting something that wasn't formalized, which could be a problem.\n\nEmotionally, the author might be right in feeling that the ex should honor the agreement, but maybe the ex feels that the relationship's dissolution changes things. The author is trying to approach it calmly, but the ex's hostility suggests that the agreement might have been a mutual understanding during the relationship, not a binding contract post-breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be overstepping by expecting a verbal agreement made in a relationship to be enforceable after it's over. The ex isn't legally bound, and perhaps emotionally, the author is clinging to a past commitment that the ex is no longer willing to honor. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting the ex's current decision, especially since there's no written proof. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm considering all angles.\n"
