I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for continuing to hold their ex to an agreement made during their relationship. The situation involves an informal agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and the ex was supposed to pay for the author's education once employed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their agreement. Since there's no written contract, it's an oral agreement, which can be tricky legally. Oral agreements can be enforceable, but it's harder to prove the terms without documentation. The author might be in a gray area here because while they expected the ex to follow through, the ex isn't legally obligated unless they can prove the agreement existed and was accepted by both parties. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The ex is hostile, possibly because the reminder of the agreement is causing tension post-breakup. The author is trying to move forward but is still holding the ex accountable. This could be seen as emotionally difficult, but not necessarily wrong. However, the author's persistence might be infringing on the ex's boundaries if the ex is trying to move on. \n\nAnother angle is the mutual responsibilities. The author supported the ex while they were in school, expecting reciprocal support later. But relationships often change, and circumstances can affect people's ability to fulfill agreements. The ex might have valid reasons for not being able to pay, but the author believes the ex should still honor the deal. \n\nLegally, without proof of the agreement, the author might not have a strong case. But morally, if the agreement was mutual and clear, the author could feel justified. However, pushing the ex after a breakup, especially when the ex is resistant, could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be prioritizing their financial needs over the ex's current situation, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of social judgment (like the AITA format), people often consider both sides. The author's position isn't necessarily wrong because they acted based on a prior agreement. However, the ex's hostility and the lack of a written contract might mean the author's expectations are unrealistic. The key is whether the agreement was clearly understood and if the author is being reasonable in pursuing it post-breakup. \n\nSo, balancing the legal aspects, the emotional context, and social norms, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation's complexity means there's nuance. The answer likely hinges on whether the agreement was explicit and if the author's actions are reasonable given the lack of legal enforceability.\n"
