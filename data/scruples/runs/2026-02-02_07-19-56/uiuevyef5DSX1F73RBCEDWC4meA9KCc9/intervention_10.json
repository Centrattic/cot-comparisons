I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a verbal agreement between an ex-couple where the man agreed to pay the woman's tuition after he finished school. Now that they're separated, she's trying to enforce that agreement, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can be tricky. Legally, they can be binding, but proving them is hard. Without a written contract, it's usually a matter of one person's word against another's. So, if the woman takes this to court, she might not have a strong case unless she has evidence like messages or witnesses. But the user isn't asking about legal validity, just moral or social wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral or social perspective. The couple is no longer together, and relationships involving financial agreements can be complicated. If the agreement was part of a mutual understanding during their relationship, does it still hold after the breakup? Some might argue that once a relationship ends, personal and financial obligations should be renegotiated, especially if the context has changed. The man might feel that the agreement was tied to their relationship and that it's no longer valid now that they're not together. The woman, on the other hand, sees it as a commitment that should stand regardless.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of fairness and expectations. The woman supported him during his schooling, expecting future support. However, people's circumstances can change, and the man might have intended the agreement under different conditions (like if they were still together). If he's no longer in a position to help or doesn't want to, is she in the wrong for expecting it?\n\nAlso, considering the emotional aspect. The couple is giving each other space to heal. The woman brings up the agreement during a conversation where they were getting along, and he reacts negatively. Maybe he felt pressured or that she's using the agreement to maintain a connection. Her approach might have been perceived as pushing him, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the woman's actions are based on her expectation of a past agreement, but the man isn't obligated to honor it if they no longer have a relationship. The woman might be in the wrong for expecting a personal commitment to be honored post-breakup without any formal arrangement.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the agreement was verbal and part of a past relationship, and expecting it to hold without a formal contract might be unrealistic and could be seen as pushing for financial support after the relationship has ended.\n"
