I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a verbal agreement between an ex-couple. The author worked while their ex went to school, with the understanding that after the ex gets a job, they would pay for the author's tuition. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It's verbal, not written, which in many places, is still enforceable but can be harder to prove. The key issue here is whether a verbal agreement can be legally binding. However, the user isn't asking about legal enforceability but rather whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong.\n\nThe author is continuing to ask the ex to fulfill the agreement even after the relationship ended. The ex is hostile, possibly feeling that the author is bringing up past issues unnecessarily. The author's reasoning is that the ex should keep their word regardless of the current relationship status. But is this a reasonable expectation?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing by an agreement made during a personal relationship, which was mutual. On the other hand, after a breakup, the dynamics change. The ex might feel that the agreement is no longer valid because the context (the relationship) has changed. Also, the author is reaching out after minimal contact, which the ex might see as intrusive.\n\nAnother angle is the practical aspect. The author is in school, and the ex was supposed to help. But since the ex is now employed and the author is not getting the support, the author is trying to get the money. However, enforcing a verbal agreement can be tricky, especially without witnesses or documentation. The author's insistence might be seen as holding the ex to an unfair expectation, especially if the ex's circumstances have changed or if they no longer agree to the terms.\n\nAlso, the author's approach might be contributing to the conflict. They mentioned starting the conversation with a friendly tone but then bringing up the agreement, which could have caused the ex to feel cornered. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling that the author is using the agreement to re-enter their life or to force them into a situation they're no longer comfortable with.\n\nIn terms of moral obligation, some might argue that promises made in a relationship don't hold water once it's over. Others might say that keeping promises is important regardless of the current relationship status. The author's perspective is that the agreement was mutual and binding, but the ex's perspective is that the agreement is no longer valid post-breakup.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they're expecting the ex to uphold an informal agreement after the relationship has ended, which the ex is no longer willing to do. The author's persistence despite the ex's hostility could be seen as unreasonable. However, if there was a clear mutual understanding and the ex benefited from the arrangement, the author's position might be more justified. But without a written agreement, it's hard to enforce, and the ex might justifiably refuse, considering the change in their relationship status.\n"
