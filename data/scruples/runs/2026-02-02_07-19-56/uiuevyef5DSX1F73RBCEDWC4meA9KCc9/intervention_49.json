I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the man promised to pay for the woman's school once he got a job, in exchange for her supporting him while he was in school. Now that they're separated, she's trying to get him to fulfill that agreement, but he's resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The agreement was verbal, not written. They're no longer together and have been keeping minimal contact. The woman reached out, started a conversation, and then brought up the agreement. The ex became hostile, saying the agreement is now meaningless. The woman argues that she supported him so he should now support her education.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. So, is she in the wrong?\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, enforcing such an agreement might be difficult. But the question isn't about legal enforceability; it's about whether ethically or morally the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the dynamics: the woman made a personal sacrifice (working while he went to school) based on an agreement. Now that they're exes, she's trying to hold him to that. But in a breakup, expectations can change. The ex might feel that the relationship is over, so the terms of the agreement are no longer binding. \n\nHowever, the woman's argument is that the agreement was mutual and she relied on it. But relationships are complex. Emotional investments and expectations can be different from explicit agreements. If the agreement was a key part of their mutual support, then she might feel justified. But if the ex feels that the agreement is now moot after the breakup, that's a different perspective.\n\nAlso, the way she approached the discussion might matter. She started with a friendly conversation, which he interpreted as something else, leading to hostility. Maybe she should have considered his emotional state and the current situation before bringing up the agreement so soon. \n\nAnother angle: in a breakup, people often need time to process. Reaching out about financial obligations can be seen as pressing, especially if there's no legal backing. The ex might feel that the agreement is tied to the relationship, which is now dissolved. \n\nOn the other hand, if the agreement was a significant part of their mutual understanding, then she has a point. But the lack of a written agreement complicates things. It's possible that the ex no longer feels bound by it, and the woman's insistence could be seen as holding a grudge or expecting continued support post-breakup. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the agreement was a genuine mutual understanding and she relied on it, then her asking might be reasonable. But if the ex is no longer willing, and there's no legal obligation, she might be overstepping. The fact that he became hostile suggests he might not want to honor it, and her persistence could be seen as unreasonable. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to determine if that's the case. The main factors are the nature of the agreement, the breakup context, and the approach taken. Since it's a verbal agreement and they're no longer together, expecting him to honor it might not be fair. Relationships often change, and post-breakup expectations can be contentious. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because she's trying to enforce a verbal agreement post-breakup without considering the changed circumstances and the other person's current willingness. But there's a counterargument about mutual agreements. However, in most cases, once a relationship ends, such personal agreements are not binding unless there's a legal contract. So, from a practical standpoint, she might be in the wrong for expecting him to fulfill it after the breakup, especially if he's unwilling now.\n"
