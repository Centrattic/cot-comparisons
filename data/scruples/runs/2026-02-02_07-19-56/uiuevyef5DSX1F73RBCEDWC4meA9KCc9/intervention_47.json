I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement made during a relationship where the ex was supposed to pay for the author's school after working while the ex went to school. Now, after the breakup, the author is trying to get the ex to honor the agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The user mentioned there's no written agreement, which is important. In legal terms, verbal agreements can be tricky because they're harder to prove. But the user is asking about moral or ethical responsibility here, not legal enforceability. So maybe the focus is on whether the author is right to expect the ex to follow through, regardless of legal standing.\n\nThe author is reaching out after minimal contact, trying to discuss the agreement. The ex became hostile, saying the agreement doesn't matter anymore. The author feels they supported the ex while they were in school, so the ex should follow through. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because once the relationship is over, the agreement is no longer binding. Or perhaps because the ex isn't obligated to honor a verbal agreement, especially after a breakup. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that the agreement was mutual and fair, and just because they're no longer together doesn't negate that. But relationships can be messy, and sometimes people change their minds after a breakup. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, people might see such agreements as part of the relationship and not binding post-breakup. Others might think that if an agreement was made, it should be honored regardless of the relationship status. \n\nHowever, there's a risk of assuming the agreement was clear and mutual. If the author is now trying to enforce it after the fact, maybe the ex feels pressured or that the agreement was part of the relationship dynamics and isn't enforceable. \n\nAlso, the author's approach might come off as holding onto the past. The ex might feel that moving on requires letting go of old agreements. The author is giving minimal contact to heal, but then brings up the agreement, which could be seen as reopening old wounds. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the agreement was part of the relationship and not meant to be a formal contract. The ex might not feel obligated anymore once the relationship ended. However, if the agreement was explicit and mutual, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut since there's no written agreement, it's subjective. The author's insistence could be seen as holding a grudge or not respecting the ex's current stance. People might also consider the emotional aspect; the author is trying to hold someone to a past agreement after a breakup, which could be emotionally challenging for the ex. \n\nIn AITA discussions, people often consider intent and fairness. The author's intent is to get what was promised, but the ex's refusal might be about not wanting to be tied to the past. So the author could be seen as in the right if the agreement was clear, or in the wrong if it's too informal and the ex is justified in walking away.\n"
