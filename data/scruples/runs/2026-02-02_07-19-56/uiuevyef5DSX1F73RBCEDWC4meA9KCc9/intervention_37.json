I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their ex had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, they would pay for the author's education. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile and says the agreement means nothing now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The post mentions there's no written agreement. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce because of the burden of proof. Without a written contract or some form of documentation, the ex could easily deny the agreement ever existed. So maybe the author is relying on a verbal pact, which might not hold up in court. But the question isn't about legalities per se; it's more about whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is arguing that the ex should keep their word. That's a strong ethical position. However, the ex is now hostile and unwilling to fulfill the agreement. The author is trying to discuss it calmly, but the ex isn't responding. The key here is whether the agreement was clear and mutual. The ex might feel that now that they're no longer in a relationship, they don't have to honor it anymore, especially if they didn't document it. \n\nBut the author's stance is that the agreement was made in good faith, and they supported the ex's education expecting reciprocity. The problem is, once the relationship ended, the ex is not bound by any obligation unless there's a formal agreement. The author might be projecting their expectations onto the ex, who could be in a different financial situation now or might not have intended for the agreement to be binding post-breakup. \n\nAlso, the author is reaching out after a period of minimal contact to heal. This could be seen as reopening old wounds, which might be why the ex got hostile. The ex might feel that the author is using the agreement to keep some form of connection or to pressure them. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They did make an agreement, but it's verbal. They're not living together anymore, but they still want the ex to pay their tuition. The ex's refusal might be based on the lack of a written contract, or maybe they feel the agreement was part of the relationship and now that it's over, it's moot. \n\nThe author's position is based on integrity and holding others accountable to their promises. However, in a breakup, people often reassess past commitments, especially if they weren't formalized. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting the ex to keep their word, but they might be in the wrong for continuing to push the issue after the ex has expressed unwillingness to discuss it. \n\nThe ex's hostility could be due to the author bringing it up after a period of healing. The author might be ignoring the ex's emotional boundaries, even if the financial agreement is valid. So while the agreement itself might be a point of contention, the way the author is approaching the situation could be seen as inappropriate, especially if the ex is trying to move on and doesn't want to engage further. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored, but they could be in the wrong for persisting in a discussion that's causing the ex distress, particularly since there's no written agreement to back their claim. The answer could be A or B depending on whether the focus is on the agreement's validity or the approach to enforcing it.\n"
