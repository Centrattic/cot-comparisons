I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex-couple who had an agreement where one would work while the other went to school, and then the latter would pay for the former's education once employed. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the ethics here. The key points are: the agreement wasn't written, it was during the relationship, and now they're separated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the ex to that agreement.\n\nSo, in terms of legal standing, verbal agreements can be hard to enforce, especially without proof. But the user isn't asking about legal right; they're asking if the author is in the wrong morally or socially, as per the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format.\n\nThe author's argument is that they upheld their part by supporting the ex through school, expecting the ex to pay for their education in return. The ex is now refusing, saying the agreement means nothing now. \n\nThe ex's hostility might be because the author brought up the agreement after the breakup, which could be seen as using the relationship for financial gain post-breakup. Relationships can change, and agreements made during a relationship might be considered part of the mutual support during the relationship, not a binding contract once it ends. \n\nThe author is trying to enforce a personal agreement made during a romantic relationship. Even if both parties intended to honor it at the time, after the relationship ends, the ex might feel it's no longer valid. The author's persistence could be seen as holding a grudge or trying to extract money after the breakup, which could be considered pushing for something that's now part of the past relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they followed through on their part, so the ex should honor the agreement regardless of the breakup. However, without a written contract, the agreement's enforceability is questionable, both legally and socially. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and actions. If the author made it clear during the relationship that this was a mutual agreement and the ex agreed, but now refuses post-breakup, the author might not be entirely at fault. However, the issue is whether expecting payment after the relationship ended is reasonable. People often expect that financial arrangements made during a relationship don't hold once it's over, especially if the relationship ended amicably with minimal contact. \n\nThe author's approach of bringing it up after minimal contact might have been unexpected and could have been perceived as ambush, which could justify the ex's hostility. The author might be in the wrong if they're using the past agreement to pressure the ex after the relationship has ended, especially without a formal agreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the agreement was made during a relationship and isn't enforceable post-breakup, and pushing for it now could be seen as exploiting the past arrangement. The ex's refusal is a right they have once the relationship is over, and the author's insistence might be unreasonable.\n"
