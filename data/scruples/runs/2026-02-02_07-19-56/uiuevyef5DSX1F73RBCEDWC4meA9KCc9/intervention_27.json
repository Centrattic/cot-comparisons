I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a verbal agreement where the ex was supposed to pay for the author's school after finishing his studies. Now they're separated, and the author is trying to enforce that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Verbal agreements can sometimes be enforceable, but it's complicated. They need to meet the criteria for a contract: offer, acceptance, consideration, and an intention to create legal relations. However, in many jurisdictions, especially for agreements related to personal services or family matters, courts might be hesitant to enforce them without written proof. Since there's no written agreement here, the ex might have a valid point in refusing, as there's no legal recourse.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author feels they upheld their part by supporting the ex while he was in school. But relationships can be complex, and what was agreed upon in a romantic context might not hold up once the relationship ends. The ex might feel that the agreement is no longer binding now that they're not together. It's possible that the ex sees it as a personal commitment that's no longer relevant post-breakup.\n\nThe author's approach is to keep arguing calmly, but the ex's hostility suggests that this topic is emotionally charged. The author might be overstepping by bringing up the agreement after the relationship ended, especially if the ex feels that the agreement was part of the dynamic during the relationship and isn't applicable anymore. The author's expectation could be based on their own perspective, but the ex's refusal might indicate that he never intended it to be a formal obligation.\n\nAlso, the fact that they're giving each other space to heal implies that the breakup was significant. Bringing up the agreement might be seen as reopening wounds or not respecting the need for closure. The author's insistence could be perceived as using the past relationship as leverage, which might be why the ex reacted negatively.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the author believes they're right in expecting the ex to honor the agreement, the ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship's context and isn't something to be enforced after it's over. The author's actions could be seen as holding the ex to a promise made in a less formal setting, without considering the change in circumstances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they're trying to enforce a verbal agreement in a context where it's not legally enforceable and may be ethically questionable given the breakup and the ex's refusal. The author's persistence could be seen as not respecting the ex's current boundary to move on."
