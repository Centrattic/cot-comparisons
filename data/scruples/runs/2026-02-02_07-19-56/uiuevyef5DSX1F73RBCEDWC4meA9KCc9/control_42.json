I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between the author and their ex. The author worked while the ex went to school, and the deal was that once the ex got a job, they'd pay for the author's education. Now, the author is trying to discuss this, but the ex got hostile and said the agreement means nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the agreement was verbal, no written contract. The ex might be in a different situation now, maybe can't afford to pay. The author is trying to hold them to the agreement, but the ex isn't willing. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, it's hard to enforce. But the user isn't asking about legal stuff, probably more about moral or social wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect partners to support each other, but when a relationship ends, such agreements might be seen as past the relationship. The author might be seen as holding the ex to a promise made in the context of a personal relationship, which is no longer valid once they're not together. The ex might have felt that the agreement was part of their partnership and doesn't apply anymore. The author's persistence could be seen as pressuring the ex, making the ex feel like the author is still expecting something from the relationship, which might not be appropriate.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is asking for what was promised. If the ex had the means and it's a matter of them not keeping their word, the author might feel justified. But the ex's hostility suggests they don't want to fulfill it now. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting this. The ex could be in a new job, or maybe their financial situation changed, and they can't pay. The author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate, not respecting the ex's current circumstances.\n\nAlso, the fact that they're in minimal contact to heal and move on. The author initiating a conversation about the agreement might be perceived as reopening old wounds or not respecting the agreed-upon space. So, the author's actions could be causing discomfort. The ex's reaction is negative, which the author acknowledges, but the author still continues to argue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But since there's no legal contract, the author's insistence might be seen as expecting something that's not binding. The ex isn't obligated to honor the deal if they don't want to. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that the ex isn't required to follow through now that they're no longer together. So, answer A.\n"
