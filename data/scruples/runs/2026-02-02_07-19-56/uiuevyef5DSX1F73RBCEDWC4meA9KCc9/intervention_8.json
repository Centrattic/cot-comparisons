I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a verbal agreement between an ex-couple. The ex agreed that while the author worked, the ex would pay for their education after getting a job. The author is now trying to enforce that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's no written agreement, it might be hard to enforce in court. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they lack proof unless there's evidence like text messages, emails, or witnesses. The ex might be right that without a written contract, it's hard to hold someone to it legally.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical side. The author believes the ex should keep their word regardless of the relationship status. But in relationships, especially romantic ones, some agreements are made in the context of the relationship. Once the relationship ends, the dynamics change. The ex might feel that the agreement is tied to the relationship and no longer binding after the breakup.\n\nAlso, the author is reaching out after minimal contact, which the ex might see as reopening old wounds or being pushy. The ex's hostility could stem from feeling that the author is not respecting their desire to move on. The author's persistence might be seen as inconsiderate, even if they believe they're justified.\n\nAnother angle: the author covered most of the ex's expenses while they were in school. The ex's job now is their responsibility. The author might feel entitled, but the ex might see it as a past arrangement that's no longer relevant. The ex's refusal could be about not wanting to be tied to the previous relationship terms anymore.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as expecting the ex to uphold a personal promise that was part of a relationship, which ended. The ex could argue that the agreement is no longer valid post-breakup. Legally, it's weak without written proof. Morally, it's a gray area, but the ex's desire to move on and the lack of enforceability might mean the author is in the wrong for pressuring them now.\n"
