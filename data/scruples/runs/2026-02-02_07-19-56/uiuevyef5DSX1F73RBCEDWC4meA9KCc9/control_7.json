I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had an agreement where the author worked while their ex was in school, and once the ex got a job, he would pay for the author's education. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Agreements between people, especially in relationships, can be tricky. There's no written contract here, just an understanding. The key points here are whether the agreement was legitimate, enforceable, and if the author is overstepping by expecting it to be honored post-breakup.\n\nFirst, the agreement itself. The ex was in school, so maybe he couldn't work, so the author supported them. In return, once the ex was employed, he would cover the author's tuition. That seems like a mutual agreement, but since it's not in writing, it's hard to prove. In legal terms, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but they're harder to prove without evidence. However, this isn't about the legal side necessarily; the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they followed through on their part, and now they want the ex to fulfill his end. But once the relationship ended, the ex is not bound by any obligation unless there's a legal contract. So maybe the author is expecting something personal to be enforced after the relationship is over. \n\nBut wait, the author isn't asking for the ex to be in their life; they just want the tuition paid. However, in a post-breakup context, expecting financial obligations from a past relationship might be seen as holding a grudge or expecting something that was part of a mutual agreement while they were together, which might not hold up once the relationship is dissolved. \n\nAlso, the ex is being hostile, which could be because the author is bringing up the agreement after the breakup, which the ex might feel is pressuring or trying to extract something after the relationship is over. The author is trying to argue calmly, but if there's no written agreement, the ex can just refuse without legal consequences. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If both parties agreed to the terms while in a relationship, but the relationship ended, the author might be in a position where they expected something that the ex isn't obligated to do. However, if the ex agreed to the terms in good faith, maybe the author is just trying to get the ex to honor a mutual understanding. \n\nBut in relationships, especially without legal binding, agreements can be seen as part of the relationship dynamics, not a separate contractual obligation. Once the relationship is over, those informal agreements might not be expected to be kept. So the author might be in the wrong for expecting the ex to uphold a verbal agreement after the breakup, especially since the ex now sees it as no longer valid. \n\nAlternatively, if the author covered the ex's expenses during school, and the ex benefited from that, maybe the author is justified in expecting reciprocity. But again, in a breakup, how much can you expect past obligations to hold? The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship and isn't binding anymore. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong for expecting the ex to follow through, but the ex isn't obligated, so maybe the author is being reasonable but the ex is not. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was mutual and the author is just trying to get the ex to honor it, perhaps they're not in the wrong. But since it's a verbal agreement and the ex is refusing, maybe the author is overreaching, expecting something that wasn't a formal contract. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were following through on a mutual agreement. However, in reality, enforcing such agreements can be tough without legal backing. But the question is about moral/ethical wrongdoing, not legal. Since the author was doing what they agreed to, and the ex is not, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
