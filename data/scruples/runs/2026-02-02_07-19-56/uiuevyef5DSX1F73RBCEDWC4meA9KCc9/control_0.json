I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex-couple who had an agreement: the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, they would pay for the author's education. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The key point here is whether there's a legal obligation. The user mentioned there's no written agreement. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be difficult. However, just because it's not written doesn't automatically mean it's invalid, but it's hard to enforce without evidence.\n\nNext, the ethical aspect. The author believes the ex should keep their word regardless of their relationship status. But relationships often involve informal agreements that might not hold up once the relationship ends. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of their relationship dynamic and isn't binding now that they're separated. The author's expectation might be seen as putting pressure on the ex post-breakup, which could be considered unfair if there's no legal or formal basis for the agreement.\n\nAlso, the context of the agreement matters. It was made during a romantic relationship, which can blur the lines between personal and financial agreements. What might have been a mutual understanding then might not be enforceable later, especially if the ex no longer wants to be part of that arrangement. The author's insistence could be seen as holding a grudge or trying to extract something from the ex after the relationship is over, which might be viewed as the author being in the wrong.\n\nAdditionally, the method of approaching the ex is important. The author tried to discuss it after a period of minimal contact, which the ex might perceive as out of the blue or as an attempt to reengage in a contentious issue. The ex's hostility could stem from feeling ambushed or from the breakup itself. The author's persistence might be causing further strain, which isn't necessarily right.\n\nAnother angle is the practicality. The ex might be in a different financial situation now, or they might not have intended the agreement to be binding once the relationship ended. The author might not have considered that the ex's willingness to agree was part of the relationship and not a standalone commitment. \n\nIn terms of legal advice, without a written agreement, it's unlikely that the author could take legal action. Therefore, the author's actions might be based on an expectation that isn't realistic without legal backing. This could position the author as in the wrong for expecting something that's not legally enforceable and possibly putting pressure on the ex in a sensitive situation.\n\nHowever, if the agreement was clearly understood and both parties acted in reliance on it (like the author working while the ex studied), there might be an argument for some form of legal claim, such as promissory estoppel. But this is a legal concept that varies by jurisdiction and would require specific conditions to be met. Without consulting a lawyer, it's hard to say, but generally, verbal agreements in personal relationships are hard to enforce.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the lack of written agreement, the nature of the relationship, the ex's possible change of heart, and the difficulty in enforcing such an agreement, the author's position might be seen as not in the wrong ethically if they believe in keeping promises, but legally they might be in a tough spot. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user is asking from a perspective that might be more about moral or social judgment rather than legal, the answer could lean on whether the author is being reasonable.\n\nIf the agreement was part of the relationship and the ex is no longer willing to fulfill it, the author might be seen as holding onto a past arrangement without considering the ex's current stance. This could be viewed as the author being in the wrong for not accepting the end of the relationship and its associated informal agreements. Alternatively, if the author is simply asking for what was promised, they might not be in the wrong, but the ex's refusal could be due to personal reasons.\n\nBut in many cases, once a relationship ends, personal agreements are often considered null and void unless there's a formal, legal contract. So, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the ex to honor an informal agreement after the breakup. The ex's hostility could be justified if they feel the author is using the breakup to extract money, which is a common issue in post-breakup disputes. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're relying on an informal agreement post-breakup without legal backing, which is not a solid basis for expecting payment.\n"
