I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup where there was an agreement that while the author worked and supported the ex through school, the ex would pay for the author's education once he was employed. Now that they're no longer together, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The user mentioned there's no written agreement. In most jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce. Without a written contract, proving the terms and the existence of the agreement might be difficult. The ex might not be legally obligated to follow through, especially since they're no longer in a relationship.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The author feels the ex should keep his word because it's the right thing to do, regardless of their current relationship status. But relationships can be complex, and expectations might not always be clear or mutual. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of their relationship dynamic and not something that should be enforced post-breakup. The hostility from the ex suggests that he might perceive the author's request as a violation of their past relationship boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author initiated the contact after a period of minimal interaction to give each other space. The ex's reaction could indicate that the author's timing or approach might have been insensitive, even if the request itself was based on an agreement. The author might be overstepping by expecting financial support from an ex after a breakup, especially if there's no formal agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did their part by supporting the ex during his schooling and might genuinely believe the ex should fulfill the other part of the agreement. The author's argument is about fairness and keeping promises, which are valid points. However, in the absence of a legal contract, it's more about personal ethics and whether the ex feels morally bound to follow through.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while the author's intention is to be fair and uphold the agreement, the lack of a written contract and the ex's hostile reaction might mean that the author is placing an unreasonable expectation on the ex after the relationship has ended. The author might not be in the legal wrong, but they could be in the ethical wrong if the ex no longer agrees to the terms or if the situation has changed since the agreement was made. So, the answer could be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because there's a case for the agreement's validity, but others might argue they are in the wrong (A) for expecting this post-breakup. However, based on the analysis, the author's position might be seen as reasonable, so the answer is B.\n"
