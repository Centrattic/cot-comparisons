I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a verbal agreement between an ex-couple where one supported the other through school with the understanding that the other would pay for their education once employed. Now, after breaking up, the person is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's no written agreement, enforcing such a deal might be difficult. Verbal agreements can sometimes be legally binding, but it's much harder to prove without evidence. However, this isn't necessarily about legal right but moral or ethical responsibility.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the agreement still holds after the relationship ended. The writer believes the ex should keep their word regardless of the breakup. The ex, on the other hand, is saying the agreement is now irrelevant. Relationships can change, and when a romantic relationship ends, people might feel that previous understandings tied to the relationship are no longer valid. The writer is holding the ex to that promise, but is that fair?\n\nAlso, timing matters. The writer reached out during a period of minimal contact meant for healing. Bringing up the agreement might be perceived as reopening old wounds or being opportunistic. The ex's hostility could be because they feel the writer is trying to exploit the past agreement now that they're separated. \n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement itself. It was based on the premise of mutual support during the relationship. Once the relationship ended, the context changed. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship dynamic and doesn't extend beyond it. The writer might be expecting the ex to honor it out of a sense of obligation, but the ex might see it as a past commitment no longer applicable.\n\nThe writer's approach is to calmly argue, but since the ex is resistant, maybe it's a lost cause. The writer might be in a position where they have to accept that the ex isn't willing to fulfill the agreement, especially without written proof. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? Well, they're not necessarily malicious, but they might be unrealistic in expecting the ex to honor a verbal agreement from a past relationship. The ex's refusal could be seen as reasonable given the changed circumstances and lack of binding agreement. The writer's persistence might be frustrating for the ex, especially if they feel the writer is holding onto the past. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're expecting a verbal agreement from a dissolved relationship to be binding without considering the ex's right to disengage after the breakup.\n"
