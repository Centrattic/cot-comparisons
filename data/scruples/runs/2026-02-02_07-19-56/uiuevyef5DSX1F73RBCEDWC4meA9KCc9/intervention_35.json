I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about an ex couple who had an agreement where the woman worked while the man went to school, and he promised to pay for her tuition once he got a job. Now, after the breakup, she's trying to get him to honor that agreement, but he's refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The user mentioned it wasn't written down, just an understanding between the two. In legal terms, verbal agreements can be binding, but they're harder to enforce without evidence. So, the author might not have a strong legal standing here. \n\nBut the question is about moral or social wrongs, not just legal. The community here often looks at intent and fairness. The author is holding someone to a promise made during a romantic relationship. But relationships can change, and promises made in that context might be seen as part of the relationship dynamics rather than a formal contract. \n\nThe ex's reaction is hostility, implying he feels the agreement no longer applies now that they're not together. There's a question of whether the agreement was conditional on them being in a relationship. If the expectation was that they would stay together, then the breakup might nullify the agreement. However, if the agreement was a mutual promise regardless of their relationship status, the author's stance might be more justified.\n\nAnother angle is the balance of contributions. The author supported the ex during his schooling, and now expects reciprocation. But after a breakup, should financial obligations still apply? Some might argue that once the relationship ends, any informal agreements should be renegotiated or abandoned. \n\nAlso, the author is contacting the ex after minimal contact to heal. Pursuing the agreement might come off as pushing the issue, especially if the ex is trying to move on. The author's persistence could be seen as inconsiderate, prolonging the healing process.\n\nOn the other hand, the author believes in keeping promises, which is a valid principle. If the ex agreed to the terms in good faith, there's an ethical obligation to fulfill it. The problem is the lack of a written agreement, which makes it subjective. \n\nSo, in terms of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) framework, it's often about perspective. If the author is being reasonable and the ex is being inconsiderate, the author isn't the asshole. But if the expectation was too much and the ex is justified in walking away, then the author is the asshole.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author is likely not in the wrong because she's trying to hold up a promise made in good faith, even after the relationship ended. However, the ex's refusal might be because he feels the context has changed. But the core issue is about honoring a commitment, which is a moral stance. However, the social dynamics might make the author the asshole if she's being pushy. But without more context, it's tricky. Since the author is calmly arguing and not being aggressive, maybe she's in the right. But the lack of a written agreement complicates things.\n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because she's trying to uphold an agreement, even if it's hard to enforce. The ex's hostility is more indicative of him not wanting to honor it, which could make him the one in the wrong.\n"
