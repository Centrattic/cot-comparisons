I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the ex agreed to pay for their education once they got a job. The author is contacting the ex about this agreement, but the ex is hostile now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The agreement was verbal, not written. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce because there's no proof. The ex might be saying it's not valid anymore since they're not together. \n\nEthically, if the agreement was mutual and both parties understood the terms, then maybe the author is justified in expecting it to be honored. But relationships can change, and sometimes agreements made in the context of a romantic relationship might not hold up once the relationship ends. The ex could feel that the agreement was part of the relationship and isn't binding anymore. \n\nThe author approached the ex after a period of minimal contact, which the ex might see as a breach of their agreed-upon space. Starting the conversation by bringing up the agreement right after reconnecting might have triggered the ex's defensiveness. They might feel that the author is trying to reopen emotional wounds or pressure them into a financial commitment now that the relationship is over.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned they covered almost everything while the ex was in school. That could imply that the author made sacrifices expecting the ex to fulfill their part, but the ex might not want to be in a financial obligation post-breakup. It's possible the author is in the wrong by not recognizing that the relationship's end might nullify the agreement, especially without a written contract.\n\nI should also think about common advice in such situations. Often, people are told not to mix finances with relationships, and when the relationship ends, any informal agreements might be seen as part of the past. The ex's hostility could indicate they don't want to discuss it, which the author might not have respected, even if they started the conversation amicably.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the agreement was considered part of the relationship dynamics rather than a separate financial contract. Without a written agreement, it's more about their intentions and how the ex perceives it now. The author's persistence might be seen as unreasonable if the ex has moved on and doesn't want to honor the past agreement.\n"
