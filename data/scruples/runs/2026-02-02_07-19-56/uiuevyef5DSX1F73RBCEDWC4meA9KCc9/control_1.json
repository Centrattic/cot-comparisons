I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex-couple's agreement where the author worked while their ex went to school, and the ex promised to pay for the author's education once employed. Now, after breaking up and having minimal contact, the author reached out to discuss the agreement, but the ex became hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. The key points are the existence of an agreement, the current status of the relationship, and whether expectations were reasonable. \n\nThe agreement was verbal, not written. The author is asking for tuition payment as per their prior understanding. The ex is refusing, claiming the agreement is meaningless now. \n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be binding, but they\u2019re harder to enforce without evidence. However, the original question isn't about legal recourse but moral or ethical responsibility. The author believes the ex should honor the agreement regardless of their relationship status. The ex might feel that their obligations ended with the breakup. \n\nThe author approached the conversation calmly, starting with small talk before bringing up the agreement. The ex reacted negatively, possibly interpreting the discussion as the author trying to rekindle the relationship or imposing conditions post-breakup. \n\nThe author's actions are based on the belief that promises should be kept, especially in agreements. However, after a breakup, expectations and boundaries can change. The author might not be in the wrong for seeking what they believe is owed, but they might have misjudged the ex's current willingness, especially without a formal agreement. \n\nThe ex's hostility could stem from feeling pressured or the conversation being reopened after a time of minimal contact. The author might be seen as holding onto the past, but their request is based on a prior agreement. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored, but they should consider that the ex might not feel bound by it anymore after the breakup. The lack of a written agreement complicates things, as it's subjective. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for holding the ex to the agreement, even if the ex is unwilling to comply now. The author's reasoning is based on the belief in keeping promises, which is valid, but the ex's refusal is also a matter of their own perspective post-breakup.\n"
