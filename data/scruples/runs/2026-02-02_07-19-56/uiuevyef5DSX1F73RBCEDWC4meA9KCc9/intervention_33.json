I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple. The author worked while their ex went to school, and the understanding was that once the ex got a job, they would pay for the author's education. Now, after breaking up and having minimal contact, the author reached out to discuss the agreement, but the ex got hostile and dismissed it.\n\nFirst, I should consider the nature of the agreement. Since it's not written, it's just a verbal understanding. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they are often harder to enforce because of the lack of evidence. So legally, the author might not have a strong case here.\n\nEmotionally and ethically, though, it's a bit more complicated. The author feels they upheld their part by supporting the ex while they were in school. The ex, however, might feel that once the relationship ended, the agreement is no longer valid. The author is arguing that promises should be kept regardless of the relationship status. But when relationships end, sometimes people reassess their commitments, especially if they weren't formalized. \n\nAnother angle: the author initiated contact after a period of minimal contact. The ex might have felt that bringing up the agreement was unexpected or inappropriate at this stage. The author might be seen as trying to extract something after the breakup, which could be perceived as unfair, even if the initial agreement was mutual. \n\nAlso, the author's approach\u2014discussing the agreement after some small talk\u2014might have come off as an ambush. The ex's hostility could be a reaction to feeling pressured. Even if the author had a valid reason, the method of bringing it up might have contributed to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, maybe not, but ethically, there's a gray area. The author might have a point in expecting the agreement to be honored, but the lack of a written contract makes it tricky. Additionally, pursuing this after a breakup could be seen as using the agreement to gain something from the ex, which might be viewed negatively. \n\nHowever, if the agreement was clear and both parties understood the terms, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for holding their ex accountable. But since the ex is refusing, and the situation is causing tension, it's possible the author is overstepping by continuing to push, especially if the ex is no longer willing to comply. \n\nIn summary, while the author might have a valid claim, the way they're handling it and the nature of the agreement (verbal, post-breakup) could make them at least partially responsible for the conflict. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because the agreement was mutual. However, the lack of enforceability and the context of a breakup likely tip it towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
