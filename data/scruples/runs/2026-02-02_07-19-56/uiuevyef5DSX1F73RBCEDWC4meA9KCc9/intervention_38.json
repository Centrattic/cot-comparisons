I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the ex agreed to pay for the author's school once he got a job. The author is now trying to hold him to that agreement, but he's being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The agreement wasn't written, so it's verbal. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're often harder to enforce. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate the ethical aspect, not just the legal one.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that there was a clear agreement, so the ex should honor it. The ex is upset, maybe because the conversation opener was too close for comfort, or maybe he feels it's too late or the agreement isn't valid anymore now that they're separated. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, agreements between people, even verbal ones, are generally expected to be kept. However, relationships can complicate things. Once the relationship has ended, the ex might feel that past agreements are no longer binding, especially if the context has changed. The author is trying to enforce a personal agreement post-breakup, which could be seen as pressuring the ex when he's in a new phase of life. \n\nAlso, the author is keeping the conversation going, which the ex might find uncomfortable. They were supposed to have minimal contact to heal, so bringing up the agreement might be seen as reopening wounds or not respecting the agreed-upon space. The author's persistence could come off as inconsiderate, especially if the ex is resistant.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't asking for money out of nowhere; there's a prior agreement. They provided financial support during the ex's schooling, so expecting reciprocity is understandable. The issue is whether holding someone to a verbal agreement after a breakup is reasonable, especially when it's causing emotional tension.\n\nI think the author's intent is valid\u2014expecting accountability\u2014but the method might be problematic. The ex's hostility could stem from the emotional context rather than the agreement itself. The author should consider whether the agreement's terms are clear, if there's any evidence (even if not written, like messages or emails), and if pursuing it is worth the conflict. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily wrong to want the agreement honored, but the way they're approaching it might be. The ex might feel it's too late, or the agreement was contingent on the relationship continuing, which isn't the case anymore. The author is taking a firm stance, which might not account for the ex's current feelings or circumstances post-breakup. \n\nSo, while the author's position is understandable, their actions might be seen as pushing the ex in a sensitive time. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. The key is the method and timing of bringing up the agreement after agreeing to minimal contact, which might make the author seem inconsiderate, even if their request is based on a prior agreement.\n"
