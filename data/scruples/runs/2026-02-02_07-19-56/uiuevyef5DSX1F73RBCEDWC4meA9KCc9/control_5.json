I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement. The situation is that the couple had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once employed, the ex would pay for the author's education. Now, after the breakup, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of verbal agreements. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding if certain conditions are met, like offer, acceptance, and consideration. However, proving the existence and terms of such an agreement can be challenging without written documentation. The author mentions there's no written agreement, which complicates things legally. The ex is now dismissing the agreement, so the author might have a hard time enforcing it in court.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally. The author's position is that they kept their part of the deal by supporting the ex financially during their education, expecting the ex to reciprocate. The ex, on the other hand, is refusing to uphold their end now. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, agreements, even verbal ones, often carry expectations of mutual respect and honesty. The author might feel entitled to the support they were promised. However, once the relationship has ended, the personal obligation can become murky. The ex might argue that the agreement was part of the relationship and no longer binding after the breakup. \n\nIt's possible the author's insistence is seen as holding a grudge or trying to use the past relationship to gain something, which could be viewed negatively by some. However, others might see the author as standing by their word and expecting the same from the ex. \n\nThe key factors here are the existence of the agreement, the lack of written proof, and the current relationship status. Legally, the author might not have a strong case, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author's actions could be seen as right if they genuinely believed in the agreement and acted in good faith. However, if the agreement was more of an expectation rather than a formal contract, the author might be overstepping. \n\nIn social contexts like these, opinions vary. Some might say the author is in the right to expect the ex to honor the agreement, while others might think that once the relationship ended, the agreement is no longer valid. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's position isn't clearly in the wrong, but they may be in a difficult spot without legal evidence. The ex's hostility might be justified if they feel the agreement is no longer applicable, but it's also possible the author is just seeking what they believe is fair. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
