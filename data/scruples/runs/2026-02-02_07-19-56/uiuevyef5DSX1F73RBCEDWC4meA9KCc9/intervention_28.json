I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-couple with an agreement where the woman worked while the man went to school, and once he was employed, he would pay her tuition. Now that they're separated, she's trying to get him to honor the agreement, but he's hostile and says the agreement means nothing now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since there's no written agreement, this is a verbal contract. In many places, verbal contracts can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce. The key elements would be whether there was an offer, acceptance, consideration (something of value exchanged), and an intention to create legal relations. However, in personal relationships, especially romantic ones, courts might be hesitant to enforce such agreements because they might see them as part of the relationship rather than a formal contract. Plus, proving the terms and that both parties agreed can be tough without written evidence.\n\nEmotionally, the situation is complicated. The author is holding her ex to a promise from a past relationship. After a breakup, expectations and emotions can change. What might have been a mutual agreement when they were together might not hold the same weight once the relationship has ended. The ex's hostility could be because he feels the agreement is no longer relevant now that they're not together. People might see it as one person relying on the other's future income, which can feel unfair, especially if the relationship didn't work out.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual support during the relationship. The author supported her ex by working while he studied, expecting future support. But if the relationship ended, does that obligation still exist? Some might argue that agreements made in the context of a relationship don't survive the breakup, especially if it's not in writing. The ex might feel that the support he received was part of the relationship, not a binding contract.\n\nThe author is trying to enforce what she sees as a promise, but without a written agreement, it's hard to hold someone legally accountable. Legally, without proof, it's tough. Socially, there's a debate on whether personal agreements in relationships are enforceable. The ex might be right in saying the agreement is null now because the context (the relationship) no longer exists.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is standing by her word, which is commendable. She's trying to be fair, but maybe she's not considering that the ex might see it differently. The key here is whether the agreement was a legitimate contract or a promise in a relationship that's dissolved. Without legal enforceability, the author might be in the wrong by expecting payment, especially if the ex is unwilling. So, in terms of right and wrong, maybe the author is in the wrong because she's expecting something from a verbal agreement in a past relationship that the ex no longer acknowledges. The answer might be A.\n"
