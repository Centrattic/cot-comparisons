I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong regarding an agreement with their ex. The situation is that during their relationship, the author worked while the ex went to school, and there was an agreement that once the ex was employed, he would pay for the author's school. Now, after they've split, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects here. The key points are: the agreement was verbal, not written, and the ex is now refusing to honor it. In many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they can be harder to enforce because there's no written record. Without a written contract, proving the existence and terms of the agreement might be difficult, especially if the ex denies it. So legally, the author might not have a strong case, but that's more about enforceability than who is in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's a bit more subjective. The author believes the ex should keep his word, which is a reasonable expectation in a relationship where mutual support was part of the dynamic. However, once the relationship ends, the obligation of the agreement might be seen as no longer binding, especially if the ex is no longer in a position to fulfill it or if the context that made the agreement possible has changed. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of a shared life plan that's no longer applicable now that they are separated.\n\nThe author's approach is to keep arguing calmly, which is good, but since the ex is hostile, it's not working. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the ex to honor the verbal agreement. The ex's refusal could be seen as not upholding their part, but the author's insistence might be perceived as holding onto a past commitment that's no longer practical or fair in the current situation. However, the author isn't asking for anything beyond the original agreement terms and isn't seeking additional support beyond what was promised.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement. If it was a clear, mutual understanding that was part of their relationship, the author has a legitimate expectation. But if the ex feels it's a personal debt that's now moot because they're no longer together, that's a different perspective. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the ex to follow through, but the ex is in the wrong for not honoring it. However, the author's insistence might be seen as not respecting the ex's current situation or the end of the relationship.\n\nIn summary, legally, the author might not have a case without written proof, but ethically, the author could be in the right for expecting the ex to keep their word. The ex's hostility suggests they feel wronged, perhaps because the author is bringing up the topic after the breakup. The key is whether the agreement was a mutual and fair understanding, and if the author is now overstepping by pressing the issue post-breakup. However, since the author is only asking for what was agreed upon and not seeking more, they might not be in the wrong. The answer is likely B, but I need to make sure there's no nuance I missed.\n"
