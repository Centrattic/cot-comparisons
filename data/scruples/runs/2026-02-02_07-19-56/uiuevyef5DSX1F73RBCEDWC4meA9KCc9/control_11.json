I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple. The author worked while their ex went to school, and the ex promised to pay for the author's school once they were employed. Now, after breaking up, the author is asking the ex to honor the agreement, but the ex is refusing and getting hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the agreement is legally enforceable. Since there's no written contract, that's a big point. Oral agreements can be tricky. In many places, for something like this, a written contract is needed to be legally binding. Without it, the ex isn't legally obligated, even if they verbally agreed. But maybe the author still feels morally entitled.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author is trying to hold the ex to a promise made during a relationship. People in relationships sometimes make promises that aren't meant to be binding, especially if the relationship ended. The ex might feel that once the relationship ended, the agreement is no longer relevant. The author might be seen as holding a grudge or expecting something that wasn't part of the breakup terms.\n\nAlso, the way the author approached the discussion. They said they started with a friendly check-in, but the ex got hostile. Maybe the ex felt ambushed or that the author is using the conversation to push for something they don't want to do. The author might not realize that the ex's perspective is different now, especially post-breakup.\n\nThe key here is the enforceability of the agreement. Legally, without a written contract, it's hard to argue the author isn't in the wrong. Morally, it's more subjective. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the lack of a legal agreement, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that the author is just seeking what was promised, so maybe B (No). But traditionally, in AITA scenarios, the lack of a written agreement and the ex's refusal post-breakup would make the author in the wrong because they're trying to enforce a personal agreement that's not legally binding. So the answer is A.\n"
