I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex couple who had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's education after finishing school and getting a job. Now, the ex is refusing to honor that agreement, and the author is trying to get them to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since it's between two people in a relationship, and it's not written down, the enforceability might be an issue. In many places, verbal agreements in personal relationships, especially without a written contract, can be hard to prove. But the question isn't about legal enforceability; it's about whether the author is \"in the wrong\" morally or ethically.\n\nThe ex is being hostile and says the agreement \"means shit now.\" The author is trying to calmly argue the point. So, from a moral standpoint, if there was a mutual understanding during the relationship, does that obligation still stand post-breakup? The author's reasoning is that they supported the ex while they were in school, relying on the agreement. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship and is no longer valid after it ended.\n\nI should think about the concept of implied contracts versus express ones. Even if there was no written document, if both parties understood and agreed to the terms, it could be seen as an implied agreement. However, in the absence of a contract, it's subjective and depends on the evidence each party can present. Legally, that's a challenge, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if they can win a lawsuit.\n\nAnother angle: the ex might feel that the agreement was conditional on the relationship continuing, and since they broke up, the terms are void. The author, on the other hand, argues that it's a separate agreement that should still be honored regardless of the relationship status. This is a common point of contention in such situations. \n\nAlso, the minimal contact part is important. The author reached out during a time when they were supposed to be giving each other space. The ex might interpret that as the author not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries, which could explain the hostility. The author didn't mention the agreement immediately but started with a friendly check-in, so maybe the ex felt it was a setup to bring up the agreement again, leading to tension.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. The author's argument is based on the existence of an agreement, while the ex is possibly seeing it as part of a past relationship that's now dissolved. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the ex to honor the agreement, but the ex's perspective is also valid in the sense that the relationship has ended and the terms might be considered null and void. There's no legal obligation, so pushing for it might be seen as holding onto the past. However, if the agreement was clear and mutual, the author's stance is justifiable.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, people might differ. Some would say the author is being reasonable to seek the support they were promised, while others might think that after a breakup, such agreements are no longer binding. The key factors are the clarity of the agreement, whether it was a quid pro quo during the relationship, and if honoring it is fair given the current circumstances.\n"
