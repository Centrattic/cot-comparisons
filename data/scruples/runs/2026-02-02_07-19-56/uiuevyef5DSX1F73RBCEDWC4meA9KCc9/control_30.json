I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex-couple who had an agreement where one paid for the other's school while they worked, with the understanding that after the ex finishes school and gets a job, they would pay back the tuition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The user mentioned it was verbal, not written. In legal terms, verbal agreements can be tricky because proving them is harder. But the question isn't just about legalities; it's about moral or ethical wrongdoing.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for holding their ex to this agreement. The ex is now being hostile, saying the agreement means \"shit now.\" The author feels that since they supported their ex through school, the ex should honor the deal. On the other hand, the ex might feel that the relationship ended, so the agreement is no longer binding.\n\nI should think about the context. The agreement was made during a romantic relationship. Sometimes, in such contexts, agreements might be made under the assumption that the relationship is stable, and once it ends, the expectations can change. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship dynamics and isn't something that should be enforced post-breakup, especially if it's causing stress.\n\nAlso, the author is reaching out after minimal contact to discuss the agreement. The ex's hostility might be due to the timing or the nature of the request, especially if they're trying to move on. The author's persistence could be seen as pressuring the ex, which might be unfair if the ex no longer wants to fulfill the agreement.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"promissory estoppel\" in law, where a promise can be enforced if relying on it caused harm. But that's a legal term and might not apply here. Morally, if the agreement was mutual and both parties agreed, the author might feel entitled. However, once the relationship ends, the ex might feel that the responsibility is lifted, especially if there's no written proof.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. Some might view such agreements as personal and not enforceable once the relationship is over. Others might see it as a matter of integrity to keep the promise regardless of the relationship status.\n\nThe author's approach of calmly arguing might not be effective if the ex is resistant. They might need to accept that the ex isn't willing to honor it and move on. But is that the author's fault? Or is the author justified in expecting the ex to keep their word?\n\nIn summary, the key points are: verbal agreement, emotional context of a breakup, differing views on responsibility post-relationship. The author's rightness depends on perspectives\u2014legal vs. moral, personal vs. relational. Since there's no written contract, legally it's hard to enforce, but morally, the author might feel justified, while the ex may not. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting it. The answer hinges on whether the agreement is considered a binding obligation outside the relationship. If the ex is not under any obligation, then the author might be in the wrong for expecting it. But if the agreement was mutual and clear, the author could argue they're in the right. However, given the breakup and the ex's hostility, it's possible the author is overstepping by holding the ex to a personal agreement made during a relationship that's ended. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the agreement isn't legally binding and the ex is no longer in the relationship, making the expectation unreasonable. Or B if the moral obligation is seen as valid regardless.\n"
