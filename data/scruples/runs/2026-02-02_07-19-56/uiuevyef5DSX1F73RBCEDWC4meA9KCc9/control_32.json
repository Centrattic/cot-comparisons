I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user and their ex had an agreement where the user worked while the ex went to school, and when the ex got a job, they would pay for the user's education. Now that they're separated, the user is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement. The ex is hostile and says the agreement means nothing now. There's no written agreement, just a verbal one.\n\nFirst, I should consider the nature of verbal agreements. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they can be harder to enforce because there's no written proof. The key factors here would be whether there was a clear understanding between both parties, and if there's any evidence that both agreed to the terms. The user mentions they covered almost everything while the ex was in school, implying they relied on this agreement to support the ex financially. The ex, on the other hand, is now refusing to follow through after the breakup.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel they're justified because they kept their part of the deal. However, once the relationship ended, the ex isn't obligated unless there's a legal contract. Without a written agreement, it's more of a personal understanding. The ex might feel that the agreement is no longer valid since the relationship is over. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, verbal agreements can be challenged because they're hard to prove. The author might not have a strong case in court without evidence. But morally, it's a gray area. The author might believe they're right to hold the ex to their word, but others might argue that the agreement was part of the relationship and no longer applies after the breakup.\n\nThe user is now trying to discuss it, and the ex is hostile. The user's approach might be seen as trying to hold onto a personal promise that the ex no longer wants to keep. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context. If the agreement was purely based on trust and mutual understanding during the relationship, once the relationship is over, the ex isn't legally bound. So, the author's insistence might be seen as expecting something that's not enforceable.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in feeling they deserve the support, there's no legal obligation here. The ex isn't in a position where they have to honor a verbal agreement post-breakup. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in expecting this to be enforced now that the relationship is over. So the answer is A (Yes).\n"
