I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong for holding their ex to a verbal agreement they had while dating.\n\nSo, the situation: They had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's school once he was employed, after the author supported him through school. The ex is now refusing to honor the agreement, and the author is trying to get them to follow through. The ex became hostile when the author brought it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if such a verbal agreement is enforceable. In many places, agreements like this, especially between romantic partners, might not be legally binding unless there's a written contract. So legally, the author might not have a case. But the question is about moral or personal wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nMoral perspective: Was the agreement clear and mutual? The author mentions it was a clear agreement. If both parties understood and agreed to the terms, then the ex breaking the agreement could be seen as in the wrong. However, sometimes when relationships end, people's responsibilities can change. The ex might feel that since they're no longer together, the agreement is no longer relevant. \n\nBut the author argues that the agreement was separate from their relationship. The key point is whether the agreement was a mutual understanding that was independent of the romantic relationship. If so, then the ex not following through could be seen as dishonest. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. Verbal agreements, especially in personal relationships, can be subjective. The ex might have thought the agreement was tied to the relationship being ongoing, and now that it's over, they don't feel bound. The author might be assuming the agreement was a standalone contract, but without a written agreement, that's hard to prove. \n\nAlso, the author is reaching out after minimal contact, which the ex might perceive as reopening old wounds or being pushy. The ex's hostility could stem from feeling pressured or that the author isn't respecting their space. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if they believed in good faith that the agreement was valid. But they might be overstepping if the agreement was never formalized and the ex no longer wants to be part of that. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, upholding promises is generally seen as right, but the context matters. If the agreement was clear and both parties intended it to be binding regardless of the relationship status, then the author has a point. If it was more of a mutual understanding during the relationship that's no longer applicable, then the ex is within their right to back out. \n\nSince the post is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that verbal agreements can be tricky, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if they genuinely believed the agreement was valid. However, the ex's perspective is also valid if they feel the agreement was tied to the relationship. \n\nBut based on the information given, the author is trying to hold the ex to a promise, which is generally considered right. So the answer is probably B (No).\n"
