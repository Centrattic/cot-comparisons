I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the ex would pay for the author's school once employed, after the author supported him through school. Now the ex is refusing to fulfill the agreement, and the author is trying to argue for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since there's no written contract, this is more of a verbal or implied agreement. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky because they're hard to prove. But the ethical side is different. The author is saying they upheld their part by covering the ex's expenses during school. The ex is now employed and not paying up.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding the ex to this agreement. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they acted in good faith, expecting reciprocity. The ex might feel that after the relationship ended, the agreement is no longer binding, especially if there's no formal contract. However, the author isn't asking for anything beyond the tuition costs, which were part of the original agreement. They also mention approaching the ex calmly and with some consideration, but the ex became hostile.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the agreement was mutual and should be honored regardless of the relationship status. Others might see it as an expectation from past relationship terms that aren't enforceable once the relationship is over. The key points are: 1) the agreement was mutual and understood, 2) both parties acted on it, and 3) the author isn't asking for anything beyond the agreed-upon terms.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the author isn't doing anything illegal, but maybe ethically they're in a gray area. However, the ex might be in the wrong for breaking the agreement. The author's persistence could be seen as reasonable if they believed in the agreement, unless the agreement was based on an understanding that only existed during the relationship. But the author is making a case that they had a clear agreement, so they aren't in the wrong for trying to enforce it. The ex's hostility might be the problem here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to hold the ex to their part of the deal. The answer should be B, No.\n"
