I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The story is about an ex couple who had an agreement: the woman worked while the man was in school, and he agreed to pay her way through school after he got a job. Now they're broken up, and she's trying to get him to honor the agreement. He's refusing and got hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It wasn't written, just a verbal one. In legal terms, verbal agreements can be hard to enforce because proving them is tough. But the question isn't about legal rights, it's about whether the author is in the wrong morally or socially.\n\nThe author is reaching out after minimal contact, trying to discuss the agreement. The ex became hostile. The author feels he should keep his word regardless of their relationship status. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants another perspective.\n\nOn one hand, the author is asking for something that was part of their mutual agreement. She contributed by working while he studied, so she might feel it's fair for him to fulfill his part. But on the other hand, once the relationship ended, the dynamic has changed. The agreement was part of their shared life during the relationship. After a breakup, expectations might shift. The ex might feel that the agreement is no longer binding since they're not together anymore.\n\nAlso, the author is pushing the issue after a breakup, which can be seen as pressuring an ex for financial support. Even if there was an agreement, the ex isn't legally obligated, and the author's insistence might be causing tension. The fact that the ex was hostile could indicate that he sees the agreement as part of the past relationship, which is over. The author's expectation might not consider the ex's current circumstances or his right to walk away from a verbal agreement once the relationship has ended.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she's trying to hold someone to a verbal agreement from a past relationship. While the intent might be to get what was promised, in a non-legal context, it's more about personal ethics. The author might be in the wrong if the agreement is seen as part of the relationship that's now dissolved. The ex isn't required to honor it, and the author's continued insistence could be seen as unfair or trying to extract money after the breakup. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
