I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for holding their ex to an agreement made during their relationship. The situation involves the author working while the ex was in school, and the understanding was that the ex would pay for their education once employed. Now, after the breakup, the author is trying to enforce that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written, which is a key point. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce without proof. The ex is saying the agreement \"means shit now,\" which is pretty harsh, but maybe they feel like the relationship is over, so the agreement isn't valid anymore. \n\nThe author's actions involve reaching out to discuss the agreement after minimal contact, which the ex found hostile. The author might not realize that the ex is moving on and doesn't want to revisit the past. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of their relationship, which is now dissolved, so there's no obligation anymore.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is asking for something they were promised in good faith. They supported the ex's education, expecting reciprocal support. The author isn't asking for money for living expenses, just tuition, which is specific. The problem is that without a written agreement, the ex can just deny it.\n\nBut legally, even if there was an agreement, once the relationship ends, personal obligations might not hold up. Also, the author is pressing the issue after the breakup, which might be seen as trying to exploit the past relationship for financial gain. That could make the author look like they're holding onto the relationship's remnants, thus being in the wrong.\n\nHowever, if the agreement was mutual and based on trust, the author's expectation is understandable. But since the ex is no longer willing to honor it, the author might be in a tough spot. The key here is whether the author is reasonable in expecting payment after the breakup, especially without a formal agreement.\n\nSo, considering all angles: the agreement wasn't written, the ex is moving on, the author is contacting the ex after mutual space, and the ex is unwilling. The author might be in the wrong for expecting this payment now, given that the relationship is over and there's no legal standing. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
