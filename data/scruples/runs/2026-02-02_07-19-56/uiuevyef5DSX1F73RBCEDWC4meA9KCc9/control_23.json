I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an ex-couple who had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's school once he got a job, after the author supported him while he was in school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their agreement. Since it's not written down, it's an oral agreement. In many jurisdictions, oral agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce because of the difficulty in proving the terms and the intent. The ex is now refusing to honor the agreement, which the author is trying to discuss.\n\nThe author's actions involve reaching out to their ex after minimal contact, starting a conversation that was initially friendly, then bringing up the agreement. The ex became hostile and dismissed the agreement. The author is continuing to argue calmly but isn't getting anywhere.\n\nNow, the key points here: Was the agreement a valid one? Even if it was mutual at the time, the context was during a romantic relationship. People sometimes make promises in relationships that aren't legally enforceable, especially if they were part of a personal arrangement rather than a formal contract. The author is holding the ex to this agreement post-breakup, which the ex now refuses. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, depends on the situation. If the agreement was clear and both parties understood the terms, the author might feel entitled. But in many cases, such agreements can be seen as part of the relationship dynamics, which can change once the relationship ends. Additionally, the ex might feel that the agreement is no longer relevant now that they are no longer together.\n\nLegally, without a written contract, proving the existence and terms of the agreement can be difficult. The ex could argue that the agreement was part of the relationship and doesn't hold up now that it's over. The author's persistence might be seen as trying to enforce a personal promise in a legal way, which might not be feasible.\n\nEmotionally, the author is trying to get what they believe is owed, but the ex's hostility might stem from the breakup and not wanting to engage further. The author's approach might be seen as reopening old wounds or expecting something from the ex that the ex no longer feels responsible for.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the ex to honor the agreement, but the reality is that without a legal contract, the ex isn't obligated. The author's insistence might be reasonable from their perspective, but in practical terms, the ex can refuse. So, the answer might depend on whether the focus is on moral expectation versus legal enforceability.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was made in good faith and both parties understood, but the ex is now refusing without a valid reason, the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the agreement was part of a relationship where expectations changed, or if the ex never actually intended to follow through, the author might have a point. But legally, without a contract, the author's claim is weak. So, from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting it, but realistically, they might not get it. The ex isn't legally bound, so the author's continued pursuit might not be wrong, but it's likely unenforceable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are holding someone to a promise they made, even if the promise can't be enforced legally. However, the author's insistence might not be the wisest move, but it's not morally wrong for them to expect it. The ex is in the wrong for reneging, but the author isn't in the wrong for trying to hold them to it.\n"
