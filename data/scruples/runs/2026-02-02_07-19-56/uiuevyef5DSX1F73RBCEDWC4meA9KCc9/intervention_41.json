I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and their ex had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, he'd pay for the author's education. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to uphold that agreement, but the ex is refusing. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. They didn't have a written contract, just a verbal one. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce. The key points here are whether there was a clear understanding between both parties, and if the ex is legally obligated to follow through.\n\nBut even beyond the legal aspect, there's the moral or ethical angle. Relationships can be complicated, and expectations can change once things end. The ex might feel that the agreement is no longer valid since they're not together anymore. The author might feel that because they relied on that agreement to support the ex through school, the ex should honor it. However, without a written agreement, it's more about trust and mutual understanding.\n\nThe author is trying to pursue this, which could be seen as holding the ex to a past promise. But once the relationship ended, the ex might not feel bound by it. The author's approach might be perceived as pressuring the ex, especially since they're trying to move on. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling that the author is reopening old wounds or not respecting the separation.\n\nLegally, without a contract, it's hard to enforce. But morally, it's debatable. Some might say the ex should honor the agreement because it was a mutual understanding. Others might argue that once the relationship ended, the agreement was part of the past and doesn't need to be honored anymore. The author might be right in expecting the ex to keep their word, but if the ex is unwilling, the author might need to accept that and move on without expecting payment.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the author might not be in the wrong for expecting the ex to follow through, but the ex's refusal could be justified if the agreement isn't enforceable. The author is in a tough spot, but maybe they are right to want the ex to honor the agreement, even if it's not legally binding. However, the approach of continually arguing might not be the best way to handle it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not the approach. \n\nGiven that, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they had a mutual agreement, and it's reasonable to expect the ex to honor it. However, without a written contract, it's complicated. But morally, the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
