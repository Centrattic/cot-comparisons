I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for holding their ex to an agreement they had while dating. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the author and their ex had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, they would pay the author's tuition. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement. The ex is being hostile and saying the agreement means nothing now. The author is arguing that they should keep their word regardless of their breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if such an agreement is legally enforceable. Since there's no written contract, it might be tough. Oral agreements can be tricky, especially in legal terms. Without a written document, proving the terms could be difficult. But the question isn't about the legal aspect per se; it's about whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong.\n\nEthically, people often expect others to keep promises, even after a relationship ends. So the author's stance that the ex should honor the agreement might be seen as reasonable. However, the ex might feel that the breakup changes things, especially if the relationship ended on bad terms or if there's resentment. The author's approach of bringing it up after some time and minimal contact could be seen as appropriate, but the ex's hostility might indicate unresolved issues.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics and expectations in the relationship. If the author supported the ex during their education under the condition that they'd repay the favor, that's a reasonable expectation. But if the agreement wasn't formalized, the ex might not feel obligated now that the relationship is over. People's perspectives can change post-breakup, and emotions can cloud past agreements.\n\nAlso, the author is trying to calmly argue the case, which is a mature approach. However, if the ex is unwilling to engage constructively, the author might not get anywhere. The key point is whether the author has a right to expect this payment. Since there was no legal contract, it's more a matter of ethics. If both parties agreed and the author fulfilled their part, the ex's refusal could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut I should also consider if the author is overstepping. After a breakup, some people feel that personal agreements from the relationship should be left in the past. The author might be clinging to the agreement as a way to maintain some control or to feel validated. The ex might feel pressured or resentful, especially if the breakup was recent or if there were other issues.\n\nIn summary, the author's position is based on the belief that promises should be kept, which is a valid ethical stance. However, without a legal contract, the ex isn't obligated, and the author might be in a position where they can't enforce it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting this. If the agreement was mutual and the ex benefited from it, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if the ex feels it's no longer relevant post-breakup, the author might be seen as being too rigid. Ethically, it's a gray area. Legally, the author might not have standing. So the answer could hinge on whether it's about morality versus enforceability. Since the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about moral responsibility, the answer might be B (No) because the author is upholding an agreement they reasonably expected to be honored. Alternatively, if the agreement was too informal and the ex never intended to follow through, the author might be in the wrong for expecting it. But given the information, the author's actions seem justified ethically, so B.\n"
