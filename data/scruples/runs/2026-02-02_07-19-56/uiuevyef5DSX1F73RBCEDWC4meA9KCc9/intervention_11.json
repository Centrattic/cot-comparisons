I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex-couple who had an agreement. The author worked while their ex went to school, and the ex promised to pay for the author's school once employed. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. There's no written agreement here, so legally, it might be hard to enforce. But ethically, if there was a clear understanding, does the ex still have an obligation? The author is asking for tuition costs, which is a financial matter. The ex is upset, maybe because they feel the relationship is over and don't want to be tied to that agreement anymore. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they supported the ex during their studies, so the ex should reciprocate. But maybe the ex feels that the agreement was part of the relationship and no longer applicable after the breakup. The author is trying to get the ex to pay, but without a written contract, it's a matter of personal ethics and how both parties perceive the agreement. \n\nI should also think about the context of the relationship. The agreement was mutual while they were dating. Once the relationship ended, the ex might not feel bound by it anymore. The author is trying to enforce a past agreement, but the ex might see it as part of their previous life together. The author's persistence could be seen as holding onto something that was part of a shared past, which isn't fair after a breakup. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the agreement wasn't written, the ex isn't legally obligated. Ethically, it's more subjective. The author might believe they're right to ask for what was agreed, but the ex might feel the relationship's end nullifies the agreement. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their expectation might be unrealistic. However, since there's no legal backing, the ex isn't obligated, so the author's insistence could be seen as wrong because they can't enforce it. Alternatively, the author's position is based on a mutual understanding during the relationship, so they might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of a written agreement and the nature of verbal agreements in relationships. Since the ex is refusing to honor it, and there's no legal way to enforce it, the author can't force payment. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author isn't wrong for expecting the ex to follow through if they genuinely believed there was an agreement, but the ex isn't wrong for refusing either. However, the author is still in the right to ask, even if they can't get it legally. But if the ex didn't agree to it anymore, maybe the author is being unreasonable. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user says the author is in the wrong. Maybe because the agreement was part of the relationship and not legally binding, so the author is holding the ex to an unenforceable promise. So the author might be in the wrong for expecting payment without a written contract. But the author's reasoning is that they relied on the agreement to make financial decisions. If the author went to school expecting that, maybe there's an ethical obligation. But without a contract, it's hard to say. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the agreement was clear and if both parties understood it as binding even after the relationship ended. If the ex is now refusing because the relationship is over, the author might be in the right to ask, but the ex isn't obligated. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but the ex isn't wrong either. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe because the agreement wasn't written, and the ex is no longer in the relationship, so the author is holding a grudge or expecting something from a past relationship. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not letting go. But it's complicated.\n"
