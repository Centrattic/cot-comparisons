I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for holding their ex to an agreement they had while dating.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person and their ex had an agreement where the user worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex was employed, he would pay the user's school tuition. Now that they're separated, the user is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement. The ex is refusing and even getting hostile.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Let me think about the factors here. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. The agreement was verbal, not written. That's a big deal because in many places, verbal agreements can be hard to enforce. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult, especially if the ex denies it now.\n2. The agreement was part of a personal relationship, not a formal business arrangement. Relationships can change, and expectations might not hold the same legal weight as a contract.\n3. The user is now trying to enforce the agreement post-breakup. The ex might feel that the relationship has ended, and thus the agreement is no longer valid or binding. There's also emotional baggage here; the user is reaching out after minimal contact, which the ex might see as reopening wounds.\n4. The user's argument is based on fairness and keeping promises, but the ex's perspective is that the agreement is null now. The user might be in a position where they feel entitled to the tuition, but legally and emotionally, it's murky.\n\nLegally, verbal agreements can be valid but are harder to enforce. Without witnesses or documentation, the user would have to prove the terms existed. Since the ex is denying it, the user might not have grounds in court. However, ethically, it's a different matter. If there was a mutual understanding, the ex might still have an ethical obligation. But the user is expecting the ex to honor it, and the ex is resisting, thinking the relationship's end makes it void.\n\nAlso, the user is using minimal contact as a way to heal, then suddenly bringing up the agreement. The ex might feel it's too late or that the user is holding onto the past. The user's persistence could be seen as inconsiderate of the ex's desire to move on.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They might be if the agreement isn't legally enforceable and the ex is unwilling to honor it. The user is expecting the ex to follow through, but maybe the ex doesn't feel obligated anymore. The user's approach could be aggressive if the ex isn't interested in resolving it. Alternatively, the user could be justified in seeking what they believe is owed, but the method and timing might be problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether enforcing the agreement is reasonable given the circumstances. Since there's no written proof and the ex is refusing, the user's insistence might not be fair, especially if the ex isn't legally bound. The user is in a tough spot, but pushing for payment without legal backing might not be the right approach. So the answer could be A (the user is in the wrong) because they're relying on a verbal agreement that's hard to enforce and might be causing distress. Alternatively, if the ethical obligation is strong, maybe not. But legally, they might be in a weaker position, so the answer is likely A.\n"
