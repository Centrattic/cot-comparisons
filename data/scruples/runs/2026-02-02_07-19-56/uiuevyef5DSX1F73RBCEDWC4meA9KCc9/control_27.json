I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the ex was supposed to pay for the author's school after finishing his own. Now they're separated, and the author is trying to get the ex to honor the agreement, but the ex is resistant.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the existence of the agreement, the nature of the relationship post-breakup, and whether enforcing the agreement is reasonable. \n\nThe agreement wasn't written, so that's a problem. Oral agreements can be hard to enforce legally, especially in emotional situations like breakups. The author is contacting their ex to discuss the agreement after some minimal contact. The ex became hostile, possibly because the author brought up the topic after a period of not talking. \n\nEven though there was an agreement, once the relationship ended, the ex isn't necessarily obligated to follow through unless there's a legal contract. The author might be expecting something that isn't legally binding, so they could be in the wrong if they're pressuring someone who isn't legally bound to fulfill the promise. \n\nBut the author argues that they supported the ex during their schooling, implying a mutual understanding. However, without a written agreement, it's hard to prove the terms. The ex might feel the agreement was part of the relationship and not a binding commitment post-breakup. \n\nSo, the author's insistence might be unreasonable because they can't enforce an oral agreement, and the ex is no longer in a relationship. The author might be expecting something that the ex doesn't feel obligated to do now. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're holding someone to an informal agreement without legal backing, which isn't enforceable, and the ex is within their rights to refuse. \n\nAnswer: A\n"
