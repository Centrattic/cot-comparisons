I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a verbal agreement during a relationship where the ex was supposed to pay for the author's school once he got a job. Now they're separated, and the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's no written agreement, it might be hard to enforce. Verbal agreements aren't always legally binding, especially in matters like education costs. So the author's expectation might be based on a moral rather than legal standpoint.\n\nThen, the social side. The ex is being hostile, maybe because the author bringing up the agreement after the breakup feels like a burden. People often have different perspectives post-breakup. The author might be seen as holding a grudge if they're pushing for payment now, even if they were nice at first. \n\nBut the author's argument is that they supported each other during the relationship, so the ex should honor the agreement. They mention they stayed calm and are trying to argue. The key here is whether the agreement was understood as a condition for their support, and if the ex's refusal is justified. \n\nPossible angles: The ex might feel the relationship ended, so the agreement is moot. The author could be in the right morally if the agreement was mutual and clear. However, without a written contract, it's subjective. The author's persistence might be seen as reasonable, but some might argue that they should've considered the ex's current situation. \n\nAlso, the minimal contact part is important. The author reached out after some time, maybe the ex is stressed or in a different place now. The hostility could be due to the mention of the agreement making the ex uncomfortable, perceiving it as a financial obligation. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at intentions and expectations. If both parties understood the agreement at the time, the author's stance is valid. But if the ex didn't take it seriously or if the agreement was too vague, the author might be overstepping. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the agreement was clear and mutual. If so, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the ex felt pressured or the terms were ambiguous, the author might have a point. However, since the ex is now refusing, and the author is trying to enforce it, the community might split. But the lack of a written agreement is a big factor here. So maybe the author is not in the wrong but might need to accept that the ex isn't willing to honor it without legal proof.\n"
