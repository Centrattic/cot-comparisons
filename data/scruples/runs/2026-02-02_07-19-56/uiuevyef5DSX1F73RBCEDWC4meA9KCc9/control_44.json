I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex couple who had an agreement where the ex would pay for the author's school once he was employed. Now, they're separated, and the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement. The ex is hostile and says the agreement means nothing now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they're harder to prove. But in some cases, they can be legally binding, depending on the jurisdiction. However, without a written contract, it's more about the intent and whether there's any evidence of the agreement existing.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they covered their ex's expenses while he was in school, based on the agreement that he would pay for hers once he was employed. The ex is now refusing, and the author is arguing he should keep his word. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for holding the ex to the agreement.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the question is whether the original agreement is still valid after the relationship ended. Some might argue that once the relationship is over, personal agreements that were part of the relationship context might no longer be binding. Others might say that promises made during a relationship should still be honored, especially if there was an exchange of support.\n\nLegally, without a written contract, it's harder to enforce. The author would need to prove the existence of the agreement, which could be difficult without evidence like emails, texts, or witness testimony. Even if proven, courts might consider the circumstances and whether the agreement was intended to be legally binding. If it was more of a personal understanding rather than a formal contract, it might not hold up in court.\n\nThe author is in a position where they're trying to get the ex to honor a verbal agreement. The ex is upset, possibly because the author brought up the agreement after the breakup, which could be seen as reopening old wounds or expecting continued financial responsibility post-breakup. The author's approach might be perceived as trying to extract money from the ex, which could be a point of contention.\n\nMoral vs. legal wrongs are different. The author might not be legally in the wrong if the agreement exists, but if the ex is no longer willing to comply, the author's insistence could be seen as being inconsiderate of the ex's current situation or the changed relationship status. The key here is whether the agreement was mutual and in good faith, and whether the author is acting reasonably now that the relationship has ended.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's position is not necessarily wrong if the agreement was genuine and there was mutual understanding. However, the lack of a written agreement complicates things. The author could be seen as not in the wrong for trying to fulfill the agreement, but the situation is nuanced. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about such agreements. If the agreement was part of the relationship's support system, ending the relationship might not negate the obligation. But others might say that once the relationship ends, personal agreements are off the table.\n\nI think the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because they're trying to uphold a mutual agreement, even though the ex is now refusing. However, the author might not have a strong legal case without written proof, but the moral stance is about keeping promises. So the answer is B.\n"
