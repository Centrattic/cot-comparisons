I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where one paid for the other's school, expecting repayment after the other finished and got a job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The user mentions it was an informal agreement, not written. In relationships, sometimes agreements are made verbally, but legally, without a written contract, it might be hard to enforce. \n\nThe author is now contacting their ex to get the tuition paid. The ex is hostile, saying the agreement means nothing now. The author is arguing that since they followed through on their part (covering the ex's school costs), the ex should do the same. But the ex is no longer in the relationship, maybe even after a breakup. \n\nI should think about the expectations here. Was the agreement part of a mutual understanding in the relationship, or was it a binding contract? Since it's not written, there's no legal obligation. However, the moral or ethical aspect is different. The author believes the ex should honor the agreement because it was mutual, but the ex might feel that since the relationship ended, the agreement is void. \n\nAlso, the timing and approach matter. The author reached out after some time of minimal contact, and during a conversation, brought up the agreement. The ex's hostility could be due to the sudden reminder after the breakup, which might have caused emotional sensitivity. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, without a written contract, it's unlikely the author can enforce the agreement. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong ethically. The author might be seen as holding the ex to a past agreement that wasn't formalized, which could be considered unfair. On the other hand, if the ex benefited from the agreement and is now refusing, maybe the author isn't in the wrong in expecting accountability. \n\nHowever, in relationships, past agreements can become complicated after a breakup. The ex might not feel obligated anymore, especially if the relationship ended amicably or under certain circumstances. The author's persistence could be seen as pressuring the ex, which might not be fair. \n\nSo, considering all factors: no written agreement, the breakup context, and the ex's reaction, it's possible the author is in the wrong for expecting a verbal agreement to be enforced post-breakup. The answer leans towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because the agreement wasn't formal and the ex might not have an obligation, but there's a nuance. However, the initial analysis suggests the author might be wrong to expect payment without a contract.\n"
