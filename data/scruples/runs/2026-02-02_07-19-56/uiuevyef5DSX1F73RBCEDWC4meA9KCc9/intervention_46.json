I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex couple who had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and then the ex was supposed to pay for the author's education once employed. Now, after breaking up, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is refusing and even hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The user mentions there was no written agreement, just an understanding. In legal terms, verbal agreements can be tricky. They exist, but proving them can be difficult, especially if one party denies the terms. So, if the author takes this to court, they might have a hard time getting it recognized without evidence. But the question here isn't about legality, it's about whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically.\n\nThe author is continuing to ask the ex to fulfill the agreement post-breakup. The ex is now unwilling, and the author is persisting. The author's reasoning is that the ex should honor the agreement regardless of their relationship status. The ex's response was hostile, saying the agreement is \"shit now,\" which might indicate that the ex feels the agreement is no longer valid after the breakup. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might feel they're in the right because they followed through on their part of the deal. However, once a relationship ends, mutual agreements might not be binding in the same way, especially if the ex is no longer in a position to honor it or if the circumstances have changed. The author's insistence could be seen as holding a grudge or not respecting the ex's current situation. \n\nAlso, the way the author approached the discussion\u2014after minimal contact and during a healing period\u2014might be perceived as pushing the ex too soon or not considering the ex's emotional state. The ex might feel that the author is reopening wounds by bringing up the agreement. \n\nOn the other hand, if the agreement was clear and both parties understood the expectations, the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to hold the ex accountable. However, the lack of a written agreement makes it subjective. The author's actions could be seen as reasonable if they believe the agreement was mutual and fair. \n\nBut given that the ex is now hostile and the situation is post-breakup, the author's persistence might be causing more harm than good. The author might be in the wrong if they're not considering the ex's current circumstances or if the agreement wasn't formal enough to be enforceable. It's also possible that the ex is in a better position to pay and is just being uncooperative, but without evidence, it's hard to say. \n\nIn summary, the key factors are the nature of the agreement (verbal vs. written), the expectations after the breakup, and the author's approach in bringing it up. Since there's no written agreement, it's more of a moral issue. If the author is being reasonable and respectful in their approach, maybe not in the wrong. But if they're being pushy or not considering the ex's situation, they could be in the wrong.\n"
