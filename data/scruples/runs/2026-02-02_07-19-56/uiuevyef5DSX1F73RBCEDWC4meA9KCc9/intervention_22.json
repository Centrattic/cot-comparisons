I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about an ex-couple with an agreement where the ex paid for school while the author worked, and now the author is asking the ex to pay for their tuition once the ex is employed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It's a verbal one, not written. In many legal systems, verbal agreements can be binding, but they're harder to enforce because there's no written proof. The author is now trying to hold the ex to this agreement post-breakup, which might be seen as using past commitments to make a claim after the relationship ended.\n\nThe ex became hostile when approached, possibly feeling that the author is bringing up the issue to get money after the relationship. The author mentions they're keeping in touch minimally, so bringing up the financial agreement might be perceived as opportunistic. The key here is whether the agreement was a mutual understanding during the relationship and if it's reasonable to expect it to be honored post-breakup. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't mention the agreement during the time they were working the deal, and only now that the ex is employed, might make others think the author is holding a grudge or trying to extract money now that the ex can afford it. The lack of a written agreement complicates things, as the ex might not remember or agree that such a contract existed. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often expect that personal agreements within a romantic relationship might not hold after the relationship ends, especially if it's not formalized. So, the author might be seen as in the wrong for expecting this agreement to be enforced after the breakup without a legal contract. The ex's refusal could be based on the belief that the agreement is no longer valid now that they're not a couple. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that it was a mutual agreement. But the problem is that without documentation, it's subjective. The ex might not agree that the terms were set, leading to a conflict. The author's approach of repeatedly arguing might be seen as pushy, especially if the ex is unwilling to engage. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because relying on a verbal agreement post-breakup without legal backing could be seen as unrealistic, and the approach might be perceived as trying to take advantage of the ex's current financial situation. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
