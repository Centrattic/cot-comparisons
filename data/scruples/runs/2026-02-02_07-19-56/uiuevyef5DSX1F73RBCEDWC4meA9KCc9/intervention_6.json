I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their ex had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and once the ex got a job, he would pay for the author's education. Now, they're separated, and the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement. The ex is refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's a legal basis for enforcing such an agreement. Since there's no written contract, it's likely an oral agreement. In many jurisdictions, oral agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to prove. The ex might argue that the agreement was part of a romantic relationship and not a formal contract, which could affect its enforceability. Without a written agreement, the author's claim might not hold up in court, especially if the ex disputes the terms or the existence of the agreement.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author believes the ex should keep his word regardless of their current relationship status. But in relationships, especially non-romantic or post-breakup scenarios, expectations can be different. The agreement might have been based on mutual trust and the context of their relationship at the time. Now that they're no longer together, the ex might feel it's no longer binding, or the circumstances may have changed. The author's insistence could be seen as holding onto a past promise without considering the current realities.\n\nAnother point is the communication. The author reached out during a period of minimal contact, which the ex might have seen as a violation of the agreed space. The ex's hostility could stem from feeling pressured or that the author isn't respecting their need for distance. The author's approach might come across as aggressive, especially if they bring up the agreement suddenly after a long time of non-contact. This could have triggered the ex's defensive reaction.\n\nAlso, the nature of the agreement itself. If it's a personal, informal agreement made in the context of a relationship, it's not necessarily a legal obligation. The ex might not have intended it to be a binding commitment once the relationship ended. The author's expectation might be based on a misunderstanding of what constitutes a valid agreement. Without clear terms and mutual legal intent, it's hard to enforce.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while the author might feel they're in the right based on the agreement, the lack of a written contract, the context of the relationship, and the current dynamics suggest that the author's position might not be legally or ethically sound. The ex's reaction could be justified if they feel the agreement isn't enforceable or if the author is overstepping by bringing it up after a period of separation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
