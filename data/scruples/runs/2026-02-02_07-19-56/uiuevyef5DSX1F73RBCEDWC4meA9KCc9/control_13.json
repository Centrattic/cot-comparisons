I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple. The author worked while her ex went to school, and he promised to pay for her education once he was employed. Now, after they broke up, she's asking him to fulfill that agreement, but he's refusing and being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since it's verbal and there's no written contract, that's a big point. In many legal systems, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but it's much harder to prove them, especially without any evidence. So legally, the author might not have a strong case. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not legally.\n\nThe ex is no longer in a relationship with the author, and he's refusing to honor the agreement. The author feels it's fair because she supported him during his studies. But relationships can be complicated. The ex might feel that since they're not together anymore, the agreement is void. Alternatively, he might have other reasons for not wanting to pay, like financial difficulties or a change of heart.\n\nThe author initiated the conversation kindly, but the ex became hostile. The author is trying to hold him to the agreement, which she sees as a promise. However, in a breakup, the dynamics change. The agreement was part of their relationship terms, and once the relationship ends, such personal agreements might not have the same weight. The ex might not be obligated to honor it now that they're separate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that she covered almost everything while he was in school. If that's true, maybe he feels guilty but is unwilling to admit it, hence the hostility. However, the author's persistence could be seen as pressuring him after the relationship ended, which might be unfair. The ex might need space to move on, and the author's continued requests could be hindering that.\n\nAnother angle: the agreement was mutual support during the relationship. Once the relationship is over, the support might not be required. It's possible that the author is expecting something from the past relationship that the ex no longer wants to fulfill. The ex might have changed his mind, and it's his right to do so. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting it, but the ex's refusal might be valid because the context has changed.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong morally for wanting her end of the agreement honored, but legally, it's tricky without proof. However, since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more about moral or social judgment, the answer might be B (No). The author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting him to keep his word, but the ex's refusal is also understandable given the breakup and lack of a written agreement. The author's persistence might be seen as reasonable if she feels it's a fair agreement, but others might see it as clinging to the past. However, the key point is that the author is trying to hold him to a verbal promise, which is a grey area. So the answer is B.\n"
