I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to an agreement they had while dating. The situation is that the ex agreed to pay for the author's school once he got a job, after the author supported him financially while he was in school. Now, they're separated and the ex is refusing to honor the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The agreement wasn't written, so in many places, verbal agreements can be tricky. Without a written contract, proving the terms might be difficult. However, if there's evidence like text messages, emails, or witnesses, that could help. But legally, the ex isn't obligated unless there's a formal agreement.\n\nThen, the ethical standpoint. The author feels the ex should keep his word even after the breakup. Some might say that agreements should be honored regardless of the relationship status, while others might argue that once the relationship ends, personal agreements don't carry over. There's also the idea that the ex might feel the arrangement was part of their relationship and not applicable post-breakup.\n\nEmotionally, the author might be feeling wronged because they gave up opportunities to support the ex. But the ex might feel the author is not respecting their separation. The author initiated the conversation, which led to conflict. Maybe the ex feels the author is bringing up a past issue unnecessarily now.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Was the agreement a mutual understanding or a promise? Did the ex explicitly agree to the terms? How did the breakup affect their relationship dynamics? Are there any cultural or social norms influencing their expectations?\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their actions are justified. Legally, without a contract, the author might not have a strong case. Ethically, it's more subjective. If the agreement was clear and mutual, the author might feel justified. But pushing the ex after the breakup could be seen as pressuring them, which might not be fair.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), because while the author isn't legally bound to the agreement, they're acting on a moral expectation. However, the ex might feel the author is overstepping, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored. It's a gray area, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and since there's no legal obligation and the ex is refusing, the author isn't wrong in their intention to ask, though the approach might be questionable. But the options are A or B. The key is legal vs. moral. Since the question is about being in the wrong, which is more about moral/legal responsibility. Without a written agreement, the author can't enforce it legally, but morally, it's a different story. The answer would be B because the author isn't in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be followed, but they can't force it. However, some might argue that the author is in the wrong for not letting the past matter and respecting the breakup. Hmm. The original question is from an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) perspective. In those communities, people often consider both legal and moral aspects. The ex is refusing to pay, and the author is trying to make them. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong, but the ex is. So the answer is B.\n"
