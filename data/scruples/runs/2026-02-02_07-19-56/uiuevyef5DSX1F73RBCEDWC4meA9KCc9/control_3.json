I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an agreement between an ex-couple where one supported the other through school with the understanding that once the other got a job, they'd pay for the first person's education. Now, the ex is refusing to honor that agreement after the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. The user didn't have a written contract, which is important. In legal terms, verbal agreements can be tricky. They might be enforceable under some circumstances, but without witnesses or documentation, proving the terms could be tough. But the question here isn't about legal enforceability; it's about moral or ethical responsibility.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting their ex to fulfill the agreement. The ex is hostile and says the agreement means \"shit now.\" The author feels justified because they supported their ex during their schooling. The key points are: the agreement was mutual, there's no written proof, and the ex is now refusing.\n\nIn relationships, especially non-contractual ones, expectations can be subjective. If the agreement was clear and mutual when they were together, the author might feel it's a matter of keeping promises. However, once the relationship ended, the ex might feel that the arrangement is no longer binding. Without a legal contract, it's hard to say who's \"in the wrong\" because it's more about personal ethics than legal obligation.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, if both parties agreed to the terms and the ex benefited from the support (getting through school while the author worked), then the author might not be in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored. However, the ex might argue that the agreement was part of the relationship and doesn't extend post-breakup. \n\nAlso, the author's approach is to calmly argue, but the ex's hostility might stem from feeling that the author is trying to re-enter their life or hold onto the past. The author's persistence could be seen as reasonable if they believe in the agreement, but others might think the breakup should have dissolved all financial obligations not legally binding.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. But since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given the scenario where the agreement was mutual and the author isn't asking for anything beyond the original terms (just tuition payment, not alimony or ongoing support), the author might not be in the wrong. The ex's refusal could be seen as breaking a promise, even if it's not legally enforceable. So the answer is B (No).\n"
