I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding their ex to an agreement they had while dating. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe couple had an agreement where the author worked while their ex went to school, and once the ex was employed, he would pay for the author's education. Now, after the relationship ended, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement. The ex is refusing and is hostile when the topic comes up. The author is continuing to ask for the tuition payment, believing the ex should keep his word regardless of their current relationship status.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if there's a legal obligation here. Since there's no written agreement, legally, the ex isn't bound by this. Oral agreements can be tricky and hard to enforce, especially in personal relationships. So from a legal standpoint, the author might not have a strong case. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nMoral perspective: Did the ex agree to this in good faith when they were together? The author's argument is that the ex benefited from the arrangement (since they could focus on school) and now that they're employed, it's their turn to support the author. However, once the relationship ended, the ex might feel that the social contract is dissolved. Relationships often involve mutual support, but when a relationship ends, people might expect that the obligations from the relationship don't carry over unless there's a formal agreement.\n\nAlso, the author is reaching out after minimal contact, trying to discuss something that's causing tension. The ex's hostility could be because they feel the topic is being brought up too soon, or they feel the author is using the past relationship to make demands now that they're separate. The ex might feel that the agreement was part of the relationship dynamic and doesn't apply anymore now that they're not a couple.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author act in good faith? The author supported the ex's education with the expectation of future support. But without a formal agreement, it's possible that the ex didn't take it seriously or circumstances changed (like the ex's financial situation). The author might not be wrong in expecting the ex to follow through if they had a mutual understanding, but the ex might feel it's a different story now.\n\nAlso, the author is using the \"he should keep his word\" argument. But once the relationship is over, the ex might not feel morally obligated anymore, especially if the arrangement was informal. In some cases, people might see this as holding a grudge or expecting something from a past relationship that's no longer active.\n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the author has no grounds. Morally, it depends on both parties' intentions and the ex's current situation. However, the author might be wrong in expecting an informal agreement from a past relationship to hold up now that they're separated. People often end relationships with the understanding that past agreements don't bind them anymore unless they're formalized. The author could be seen as trying to extract something from the ex after the relationship is over, which the ex isn't obligated to do. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was part of the relationship's mutual support, ending the relationship might terminate that agreement. The author is trying to enforce a past arrangement, which the ex might not feel responsible for now. So yes, the author could be in the wrong by expecting the ex to honor an informal agreement after the relationship is over, especially without any legal binding. So the answer is A.\n"
