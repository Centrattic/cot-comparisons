I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex expecting the other to fulfill a verbal agreement where the ex paid for their living expenses while the author was in school, and now the author is asking for tuition reimbursement once the ex is employed. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Since there's no written agreement, it's a verbal one. Legally, verbal agreements can be enforceable, but it's much harder without witnesses or documentation. The author might have a hard time proving the agreement existed if it's just a verbal promise.\n\nEmotionally and morally, this is tricky. The author and ex are no longer together and are keeping minimal contact. The ex is now hostile when the author brings up the topic. The author might feel wronged because they followed through on their part. But relationships can be complex, and once they end, the dynamics change. The ex might not feel obligated anymore, especially if the relationship was terminated. \n\nThe author is approaching it as a matter of keeping their word, which is a noble stance. However, the ex might see it as part of their previous relationship and not a binding obligation post-breakup. The author's insistence could be perceived as pressuring the ex, which might not be fair if the ex is unwilling to honor the agreement now.\n\nAlso, the author's approach might be seen as not respecting the ex's current situation or boundaries. If the ex is hostile, maybe they feel it's time to move on without financial ties. The author's continued pursuit could be seen as not letting go, which might be the real issue here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored. But the problem is in the execution. The lack of a written agreement makes it hard to enforce. Additionally, the author's persistence might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation, especially after a breakup. \n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical angles, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for expecting the agreement to be honored, but their approach might not be effective. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but the situation is complicated.\n"
