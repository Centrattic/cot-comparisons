I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where the ex was supposed to pay for the author's school once he got a job. Now, the author is trying to get him to honor that, but the ex is being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The agreement was verbal, not written. They had a specific arrangement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and then the ex would pay for the author's education. The author is now reaching out to discuss this, and the ex is resisting, saying the agreement \"means shit now.\"\n\nThe legal aspect here is important. Without a written contract, enforcing such an agreement can be tough. But the question isn't about legality\u2014it's about whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they both had a mutual understanding, and since they were in a relationship, the ex should still hold up his end. The ex, on the other hand, might feel that after the breakup, the agreement is no longer binding. The author is trying to negotiate calmly, but it's not working. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, people often make promises or understandings based on their current emotional state. If the relationship ended, the ex might be reevaluating past commitments. The author's insistence could be seen as holding a grudge or expecting something that the ex no longer wants to fulfill. \n\nBut the author's perspective is that they followed through on their part by supporting the ex during school. So, if the ex is now in a position to do the same, why shouldn't he? The problem is that agreements made in personal relationships, especially verbal ones, can be subjective. What was a promise to one might be a gesture of the time to the other.\n\nAlso, the ex's hostility suggests that bringing up the agreement is causing tension. The author might be perceived as using the agreement as a way to seek validation or payment for something that isn't a legal obligation. \n\nIn ethical terms, fairness is subjective. The author might believe in fairness and accountability, while the ex might prioritize moving on without financial ties. However, the author isn't demanding anything illegal, just using the agreement as leverage. It could be seen as trying to extract money post-breakup, which is a common scenario where the person is in the wrong unless there's a legal contract.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because verbal agreements in personal relationships without legal backing can be seen as unreasonable to enforce, especially after a breakup. The ex isn't obligated to honor it, and the author's persistence might be causing unnecessary conflict.\n"
