I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple who had an agreement where one would pay for the other's school after they finish theirs. Now, they're separated, and the author is trying to get the ex to uphold the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but proving them can be tough. However, the question isn't about legal enforceability but whether the author is morally or ethically in the wrong.\n\nThe author is asking the ex to fulfill the agreement, which is about tuition costs. The ex is being hostile, possibly because he feels the relationship ended and the agreement is no longer relevant. The author argues that the agreement exists regardless of their current relationship status.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being reasonable in seeking what they believe is a mutual agreement. The ex was supported during his schooling, so the author expects reciprocal support. On the other hand, the ex might feel that once the relationship ended, the agreement is void, especially since they're not in a committed situation anymore. There's no legal contract, so it's more of a moral obligation.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The author isn't demanding something illegal; they're asking for what they believe is owed based on a past agreement. However, the author is persistently contacting the ex about this, which could be seen as pressuring or not respecting the ex's decision to have minimal contact. The initial outreach was during a healing period, which the author mentions was to have a discussion about the agreement. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling ambushed or that the author isn't respecting their need for space.\n\nAlso, the author's insistence could be seen as holding a grudge or not moving on. The ex might have changed their mind about the agreement after the breakup. Even if there was a mutual understanding before, post-breakup, expectations can shift. The author might not be considering that the ex is no longer in a position to fulfill the agreement, or perhaps the ex feels it's unfair now. The author's stance is about keeping a promise, but without a written agreement, it's subjective. The author is in a tough spot, but the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting the agreement to hold, but the way they're approaching it\u2014persistently contacting and arguing\u2014might be problematic. However, the core issue is about the agreement's validity. If the agreement was mutual and clear, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the ex never intended to fulfill it, the author's insistence could be seen as unreasonable. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n\nSince the agreement was verbal and the author isn't using legal threats but is just asking, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the ex's refusal might be valid if the agreement was conditional on the relationship being intact. But the author argues it's separate. So, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong morally. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But maybe the author is pushing too much after the breakup, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the core issue is the agreement. If the agreement was valid, the author isn't wrong. The ex's hostility might be uncooperative, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. So, likely B.\n"
