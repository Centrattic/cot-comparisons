I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex-couple who had an agreement that one would work while the other went to school, and the latter would pay for the former's education once employed. The author is now trying to enforce that agreement, but the ex is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. There's no written agreement, which is important. Oral agreements can be tricky legally. The author is contacting the ex to discuss the agreement, and the ex is getting hostile. The author argues that the ex should honor the verbal pact even after the breakup. \n\nI should think about the legal enforceability of verbal agreements. In many places, verbal agreements are possible but hard to prove. Without written documentation, it's difficult to take to court. So maybe the author is right in expecting the ex to honor the agreement, but legally, it's a weak position. \n\nEmotionally, though, maybe the author is overstepping. The ex might feel that the relationship is over, and thus the agreement is no longer binding. The author is trying to hold the ex to a personal promise, which can be seen as holding a grudge or not respecting the end of the relationship. \n\nAlso, the way the author approached the conversation might have been too direct or made the ex uncomfortable. The ex's hostility could be due to the author bringing up the agreement after a breakup, which might feel like a demand rather than a friendly discussion. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. Legally, the agreement might not hold up because it's verbal. Emotionally, the author might be seen as not respecting the breakup by pushing for the agreement. On the other hand, the author is trying to be fair about a prior understanding. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, so I need to decide if that's accurate. Maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're trying to enforce a verbal agreement post-breakup, which could be seen as unreasonable. However, if the agreement was clear and mutual, maybe not. But since there's no written proof, the author's insistence might not be justified. So leaning towards A.\n"
