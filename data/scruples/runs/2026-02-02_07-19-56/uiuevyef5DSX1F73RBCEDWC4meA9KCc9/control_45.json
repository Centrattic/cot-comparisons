I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting their ex to honor a verbal agreement about paying for their school after the ex finishes school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It was verbal, not written. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they can be harder to enforce because there's no written proof. However, the enforceability might depend on local laws and the specifics of the agreement. But beyond the legal aspect, there's the moral and ethical angle.\n\nThe author worked while the ex was in school, expecting reimbursement for their tuition once the ex got a job. The ex is now refusing to honor that, saying the agreement means \"shit now.\" The author feels they kept their end of the bargain, so the ex should keep theirs.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is trying to fulfill their educational goals and relying on the agreement made during the relationship. On the other hand, once the relationship ended, the ex might feel that the agreement is no longer valid, especially if there was no formal contract.\n\nBut here's the thing: agreements made in personal relationships, especially verbal ones, can be tricky. The ex might not feel obligated anymore once they're no longer in a relationship. The author's expectation might be based on the relationship's context, which has now changed. However, the author isn't asking for money for emotional support or anything; it's a financial agreement that was part of their arrangement during the relationship.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if they both mutually agreed on the terms during the relationship, then the author has a right to expect that the agreement is still valid, especially if they followed through on their part. The ex's refusal could be seen as breaking a promise, which isn't necessarily the author's fault. However, the author might not have considered that the agreement was tied to the relationship and might not hold once it ended. But since there was no written contract, the author's position is weaker legally, but morally, it's a bit more nuanced.\n\nWait, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So even if the ex is being unreasonable, does that mean the author is in the right? The question is whether the author's actions are justified. The author isn't doing anything illegal per se, just trying to enforce a verbal agreement. The ex is the one breaking the agreement. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the agreement was part of the relationship and not a formal contract, maybe the author is overreaching by expecting it to be honored post-breakup. That could be a point. But the author's argument is that the agreement was mutual and they fulfilled their part, so they have a valid claim.\n\nHmm. I think the key is that the author isn't in the wrong for expecting the ex to honor a mutual agreement, even if it's verbal. However, the ex's refusal is a problem. The author's actions are reasonable in that context. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
