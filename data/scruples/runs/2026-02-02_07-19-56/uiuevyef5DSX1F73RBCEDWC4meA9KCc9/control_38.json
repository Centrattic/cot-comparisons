I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about an agreement between an ex-couple where one worked while the other went to school, with the understanding that the latter would pay for the former's education after getting a job. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to hold their ex to that verbal agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Since it's verbal and not written, that's a big point. Legally, verbal agreements can be tricky because they're hard to prove. But that's not necessarily about who's morally right, just about enforceability.\n\nThe author is trying to get their ex to honor the agreement, which is understandable if they believe it was a valid understanding. But is the author wrong in doing so? Well, in terms of morality, it's more about whether the agreement was fair and mutual. If both parties agreed and it was part of their relationship dynamic, the author has a point. However, maybe the ex feels the agreement is tied to the relationship itself, which is over. So when the relationship ended, the obligation might not be seen as binding anymore by the ex.\n\nAlso, the ex became hostile. The author mentions that they approached the topic after a friendly check-in. The ex might feel that the author is bringing up the agreement too soon or in a way that's pressuring them, especially since they're supposed to be taking space. The author's insistence might come off as inconsiderate, even if they're trying to be calm.\n\nAnother angle: did the ex have the opportunity to work while the author was in school? If the agreement was that the author would work and support the ex's education, and then the ex would support the author's, but the ex's schooling is now done and they haven't paid, maybe the author is justified in expecting that. However, without a written agreement, the ex can argue that it was never a formal commitment.\n\nAlso, relationships can change, and what was agreed upon in the heat of a relationship might not be as binding once it's over. The author might be expecting their ex to honor something that the ex no longer feels is necessary, especially if the relationship didn't end on good terms or there's lingering resentment.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're not necessarily \"wrong\" in wanting their ex to honor the agreement, but they might be unrealistic about the ex's willingness to comply, especially without a written contract. The author could be seen as holding onto a past commitment that the ex no longer acknowledges. Also, trying to enforce a verbal agreement from a past relationship might be perceived as using guilt or pressure, which could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, if both parties agreed and it was a mutual understanding, then the author has a case. However, without a formal agreement, it's more about the ex's perspective. So maybe the answer depends on whether the agreement was clear and mutual, and whether the ex is in a position to fulfill it. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering that the agreement is verbal and the ex is refusing, the author's insistence might not be wrong, but it's possible that their approach is causing conflict unnecessarily. So maybe the answer is B (No) because the author isn't wrong in expecting their ex to honor the agreement, even if it's verbal. But without a written contract, the author might not have legal recourse, but that's not about right or wrong. The question is about moral wrong, so B might be the right answer.\n"
