I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong regarding an agreement with their ex.\n\nFirst, the situation: the ex couple had an understanding where the author worked while the ex went to school, and in return, the ex would pay for the author's education once employed. Now, after the breakup, the author is asking the ex to fulfill that agreement, but the ex is refusing and getting hostile.\n\nSo, the main question is if the author is wrong for holding the ex to this agreement. The key points here are whether the agreement is legally binding and the nature of the relationship. Since there's no written agreement, it's probably an oral or implied contract. In many jurisdictions, oral agreements can be enforceable, but they're harder to prove. However, if the ex is employed now, the author is asking for their share of the support as per their agreement.\n\nBut here's the catch: the agreement was made during a romantic relationship. When two people are in a committed relationship, some agreements might be seen as part of the relationship rather than a formal contract. Courts might consider if there was an intention to create legal relations. For example, in personal relationships, especially romantic ones, it's less likely that a court would enforce such agreements unless there's clear evidence of intent. \n\nAlso, the author is now asking for tuition payments after the breakup. Even if there was an agreement, once the relationship is over, the ex isn't necessarily obligated to fulfill it unless there's a legal contract. The ex might be using the breakup as a reason to void the agreement. The author's argument is about keeping their word, but without a written agreement, proving the terms might be difficult.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be seen as expecting continued financial support from an ex after the relationship ended, which some might view as unreasonable. The ex could argue that the agreement was conditional on the relationship continuing, which isn't the case anymore. \n\nHowever, the author's position is that the agreement was independent of the relationship's status, so the ex should still honor it. But without a written contract, it's a matter of interpretation. The host's response might hinge on whether the agreement was a mutual, separate obligation from the relationship itself.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could go either way, but since there's no written agreement and it's based on a prior relationship, the author might be in a weaker position legally. But morally, it depends on whether the agreement was clear and mutual. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which could be a moral or legal judgment. Legally, they might not have a case, but morally, if the agreement was clear, the author might be right. However, the answer options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is based on legal standing, then B (not wrong) because the author is asserting a prior agreement, but if the court wouldn't enforce it, then maybe A. But the question is a moral judgment too. The host might say the author is in the right to ask, but the ex is under no obligation. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But maybe the answer is A because the agreement is unenforceable, so the author is wrong to expect it. Hmm. Need to check typical AITA answers. Usually, AITA answers consider the enforceability and the nature of the agreement. Often, such agreements without written contracts are seen as not enforceable, so the author is wrong to expect it. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is wrong for expecting payment without a contract, then answer A. Otherwise, B. I think the answer is B because the author isn't wrong for trying to honor the agreement, but the ex isn't obligated. So the author isn't in the wrong; the ex is just not honoring it. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since there's no contract, maybe the author is wrong in expecting it. But the user's story is that they made an agreement, so they might not be wrong in their moral stance. So, the answer is B.\n"
