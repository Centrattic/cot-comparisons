I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their ex had an agreement where the author worked while the ex went to school, and then the ex would pay for the author's education once employed. Now that they're separated, the author is trying to get the ex to honor that agreement, but the ex is being hostile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It wasn't written down, so that's a big factor. Verbal agreements can be tricky because they're hard to enforce legally. The ex is probably saying it's no longer valid, maybe because they're no longer in a relationship. The author feels they're entitled to the tuition payment based on the prior arrangement.\n\nThe author initiated contact to discuss the agreement after minimal contact, which the ex might have perceived as a sudden demand rather than a friendly check-in. The ex's hostility might stem from feeling pressured or that the author is resurfacing an old issue. \n\nLegally, without a written contract, proving the agreement exists could be difficult. The ex isn't obligated to follow through if they don't acknowledge the agreement. Emotionally, the author might be right in expecting honesty, but relationships ending can complicate such matters. The author might be seen as holding onto a past agreement when the relationship is over, which the ex might consider a thing of the past. \n\nAlso, the author's insistence could be seen as not respecting the ex's current stance, especially after a breakup where boundaries are being set. The key points are the enforceability of a verbal agreement, the context of the relationship ending, and mutual expectations. The author's actions might be reasonable in their view, but the ex's refusal could be justified if the agreement isn't legally binding. So, the author might not be in the wrong morally if they believed in the agreement, but legally and in terms of the ex's right to change their mind, the author might be in a tough spot. However, since the question is about being in the wrong (as an AITA), it's more about moral/ethical perspective. The answer might hinge on whether the agreement was mutual and clear, and if the author is overstepping by pursuing it post-breakup.\n"
