I would work  while he went to school and when he was finished and became employed, he would pay my way through school.  I obviously don\u2019t expect to live with him, but there\u2019s nothing stopping him from living up to his word by paying my tuition costs.  \n\nHe and I have been giving each other minimal contact.  Just some space to heal and move on.  Today I reached out to discuss our agreement.  I started off by asking him how he\u2019s been doing, told him how I was.  We were interacting nicely so it seemed like the time was finally ready to discuss our agreement.  He became hostile about it.  I think maybe he read a bit into our conversation opener.  It\u2019s the only reason I can see for him to get upset. \n\nHe said our agreement means shit now.  I covered almost everything while he was in school.  I would have never done that had there not been a clear agreement that he would pay for mine.  I\u2019m not sure if there\u2019s any actions I can take, there was no written agreement.  So for now I basically just keep calmly arguing with him about it.  It\u2019s not getting me far, but I won\u2019t just give up!  He should keep his word whether we are together or not.  \n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about an ex couple who had an agreement where one paid while the other went to school, with the expectation that the latter would cover the former's tuition once employed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. It's verbal, not written, which makes it tricky. In many places, verbal agreements can be legally binding, but they're harder to enforce because there's no proof. The ex is arguing that the agreement isn't valid anymore, maybe because they're no longer together.\n\nThe author is reaching out to discuss the agreement after minimal contact, which might come across as sudden or unwelcome. The ex's hostility could be because the author is bringing up something that was part of their past relationship, and now that it's over, the ex doesn't feel bound by it anymore. \n\nThe author's intention is understandable\u2014expecting someone to honor a promise. However, the ex might see the relationship as dissolved, and any agreements made during that time as null now. Especially if the agreement was based on the context of their relationship, which is no longer active. \n\nAlso, the author is holding the ex to a verbal agreement without any written documentation. That's a risk, as people can change their stance without legal repercussions. The author might feel wronged, but in terms of right or wrong, the ex isn't obligated to follow through unless there's a legal contract. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not necessarily wrong in expecting the ex to keep their word, but they might have been wrong in assuming the agreement would still hold after the relationship ended, especially without a written agreement. The ex isn't legally bound, and emotionally, it's a different matter. The author is right in wanting the ex to honor the promise, but the ex has the right to change their mind once the relationship is over. Therefore, the author is in the wrong in expecting the ex to fulfill the agreement after the breakup without a formal contract.\n"
