My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight in their relationship. The author is a woman in her 30s who's been with her husband for seven years. She's struggled with weight, having lost 70 pounds in the past but currently fluctuates between 64-70kg. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lb, which she achieved briefly but couldn't maintain. He's disciplined and doesn't understand her struggles, thinking she's lazy. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay at her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Weight loss is a personal journey influenced by various factors like metabolism, stress, health, and emotional well-being. The husband's criticism might stem from his own disciplined lifestyle, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for not meeting his expectations. Everyone has different body types and challenges. The author acknowledges she could try harder but also has the right to prioritize her health and happiness over his standards. The husband's pressure could be harmful, promoting a negative self-image. The author's decision to accept her current state might be a form of self-acceptance, which is valid. However, she's also admitting she could try harder, so there's a personal conflict. But is that her fault? Not necessarily. It's complex because personal goals and relationships can clash. The key is whether the author is wrong for not meeting her husband's expectations. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the author isn't harming anyone, and her perspective is about self-acceptance, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic, so the author isn't at fault for not conforming.\n"
