My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman in her 30s, married for 7 years. Her weight has been a topic in their relationship. She fluctuates between 64-70kg (which is around 140-154 lbs) at 168cm tall. She used to be much heavier, around 220 lbs, but managed to lose 70 lbs, which she kept off. She had a period where she was very active and disciplined, getting down to 125 lbs, but her job became demanding, and she hasn't maintained that. Her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs and doesn't understand why it's hard and emotional for her. He thinks she's not trying hard enough, calling her lazy, and worries she'll get fatter as she ages. The author says she's not trying as hard as she could and that it's okay to stay as she is now without strict tracking.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder and accepting her current weight.\n\nFirst, let's consider the husband's perspective. He's very disciplined and fit, top 5% in his age group. He might see weight management as something that's within her control, given his own success. He wants her to reach a specific weight, maybe for her health or his own preferences. But he doesn't seem to understand the emotional struggle she's facing, which could indicate a lack of empathy or support.\n\nOn the other hand, the author mentions that weight management is a constant struggle for her. She's admitted she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also okay with her current status. There's a balance between personal health goals and the expectations of a partner. The husband's approach might be pressuring her, which isn't healthy. However, the author is choosing comfort over effort, which could lead to health issues if her weight continues to fluctuate.\n\nBut the key here is whether she's in the wrong. The question is about her not trying harder. If she's aware that she could do more but chooses not to, does that make her in the wrong? Or is it about mutual respect and understanding from both sides?\n\nIn relationships, it's important for partners to support each other's goals without pressuring them. The husband's criticism might be harmful, but the author's acceptance of her current state could be seen as not prioritizing her health. However, the author isn't in a critical health situation based on the info given. She's in a range that's considered normal to overweight, but she's fluctuating. The husband's goal is to get her to a lower weight, which she achieved before but hasn't maintained due to life circumstances.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if she's aware of the potential consequences (like health risks or the husband's concerns) and chooses not to act. But if she's making a conscious choice for her quality of life, maybe not. However, since she admits she's not trying as hard as she could, perhaps there's room for her to make efforts. The husband's approach might be part of the problem, but the author's acceptance without effort could be seen as a personal choice. But the question is about her being in the wrong for not trying harder.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is the one in the wrong for not being supportive and understanding her struggles. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since she's choosing to stay at her current weight without trying as hard, maybe she is, because she's aware it's an issue and isn't putting in effort. However, it's also possible that her struggle is valid and she's making a healthy choice for herself. The answer might depend on cultural views on weight, health, and personal responsibility.\n\nIn the AITA subreddit, often the focus is on whether the person is being unreasonable. If the husband is pushing for a specific weight and the author is choosing her comfort, but the author knows she's not trying as hard as she could, maybe she's in the wrong. But if her choice is about her health and happiness, then not. However, the post doesn't mention health issues, just the husband's desire and her own admission of not trying. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not entirely sure. The husband's lack of empathy is a problem, but the question is about the author's actions. Since she's not making an effort despite knowing she could, perhaps she is.\n"
