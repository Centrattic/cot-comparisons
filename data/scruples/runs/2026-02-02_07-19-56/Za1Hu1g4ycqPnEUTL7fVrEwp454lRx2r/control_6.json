My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the husband is pushing for the author to reach a specific weight, which she previously achieved but has since fluctuated. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband wants her to get back to 125lb, seeing her current weight as not meeting the goal. He's disciplined and thinks she's not trying hard enough. The author acknowledges she could try harder but feels it's okay to accept her current state. She also mentions that maintaining weight is a struggle and that it's emotional for her.\n\nThe key points here are about personal health, autonomy, and expectations in a relationship. The husband's perspective might stem from his own discipline and fitness, which could lead him to underestimate the difficulty others might have. The author, on the other hand, is dealing with the emotional and physical challenges of weight management, which isn't just about willpower.\n\nWeight management is complex and varies for each individual. What works for one person might not work for another. The author's fluctuation between 64-70kg isn't necessarily unhealthy, especially if she's in a healthy range for her height. The husband's insistence on a specific number could be imposing his standards on her, which might not consider her personal health journey.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder. The answer hinges on whether she's neglecting her health or if the husband's expectations are unrealistic. Since the author is aware she could try harder but chooses to be at peace with her current weight, that's a personal choice. There's no inherent wrong in choosing a balanced approach that includes mental and emotional well-being alongside physical health.\n\nAlso, relationships should respect each other's perspectives. The husband's lack of understanding about the emotional aspect might be a bigger issue than the author's current weight. The author isn't being lazy; she's managing a difficult aspect of her life. The pressure from the husband could be harmful if it leads to unhealthy behaviors or low self-esteem.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Her decision to accept her current state while acknowledging there's room for improvement is a valid personal choice. The husband's inability to support her approach without criticism is more problematic. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
