My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The author has a history of weight issues, went from 220lbs to 125lbs, but now fluctuates between 140-154lbs. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lbs and thinks she's not trying hard enough, calling her lazy. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but wants to accept her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's weight has been a long-term struggle. She lost a significant amount before but it's hard to maintain. Now, her husband is pressuring her, and she's feeling emotional about it. She acknowledges some self-responsibility but also feels that her husband doesn't understand the difficulty.\n\nThe key points here are mutual expectations and respect. The husband's approach might be dismissive of her challenges, which could be hurtful. However, the author is choosing not to put in the effort she knows she could. But does that make her the asshole? Or is the husband being unrealistic?\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to support each other. The husband's insistence without understanding her emotional and physical struggles might be the issue. The author is trying to balance her own well-being with her husband's expectations. Her admission that she's not trying as hard as she could shows self-awareness, but she's also recognizing her right to accept her current state.\n\nThe question is whether not trying harder makes her the asshole. If the husband is pressuring her in a harmful way, maybe he's at fault. But if the author is making a conscious choice to not strive for that weight, perhaps she's not in the wrong. It's a balance between personal agency and relationship dynamics. The answer depends on whether the author's choice is her right to make, despite the husband's wishes. Since she's not harming anyone and is self-aware, maybe she's not in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
