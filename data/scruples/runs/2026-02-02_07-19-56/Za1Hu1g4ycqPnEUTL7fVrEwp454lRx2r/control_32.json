My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman in her 30s who's been in a relationship with her husband for seven years. They've known each other for over a decade. Her weight has been an ongoing topic in their relationship. She's currently between 64-70 kg (around 168 cm tall), which is similar to when they met. She used to be much heavier, around 220 lbs, but managed to lose 70 lbs and has stayed at that lower weight. However, she's now fluctuating around 140-154 lbs. She mentions a period where she was very active and disciplined, losing down to 125 lbs, but that's hard to maintain with her demanding job now. Her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs, but he doesn't understand the struggle. He's disciplined and thinks she's being lazy, which makes her emotional. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's okay with her current state and doesn't want to track everything.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The husband's perspective is that he wants her to meet his ideal, and he's using his own discipline as a benchmark. The author knows she could try harder but is content with her current weight. The key here is whether the author's choice is morally wrong. \n\nIn terms of health, maybe the author isn't in a dangerous weight range. She's fluctuating but hasn't mentioned any health issues. The husband might be concerned about her health, but he's not a medical professional. The author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could suggests some self-awareness, but she's choosing to accept her current state. \n\nSocially and emotionally, the husband's pressure could be contributing to her emotional distress. Weight loss can be a sensitive issue, and constant pressure from a partner might not be healthy. The author is in a position where she's aware of her limitations (job, possible emotional barriers) and is making a choice based on her own priorities. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is honest about her efforts. She's not denying that she could do better, but she's prioritizing her well-being in other ways. The husband's approach is more rigid, which might not account for the author's personal circumstances. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's choice is a matter of personal autonomy versus the husband's expectations. The question is whether not trying harder makes her the asshole. The author is not harming others by staying at her current weight. Her husband's dissatisfaction is his own issue, but the author is making a choice based on her own life circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for choosing her current lifestyle and not meeting her husband's expectations, especially given the health context and personal challenges she faces.\n"
