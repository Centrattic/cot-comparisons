My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about weight loss and a relationship. The author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. She's been fluctuating in weight between 64-70kg, which is around 140-154 lbs for someone 5'6\". She used to be heavier, lost 70 lbs, but now it's a struggle. Her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs, which she achieved before but couldn't maintain. He thinks she's not trying hard enough, calls her lazy, and says she'll get fatter as she ages. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels okay with her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's had a history of significant weight loss, which is a big achievement. Maintaining weight loss is notoriously difficult, especially with a demanding job. The husband's expectations might not consider the complexity of her situation. He's very fit and disciplined, so maybe his approach is more about his own standards rather than hers. The author's struggle with emotional aspects and the difficulty of maintaining a strict regimen could be valid factors.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. Weight loss isn't just about willpower; it's influenced by metabolism, lifestyle, mental health, and other factors. The husband's criticism might be invalidating her efforts. However, the author does admit she isn't trying as hard as she could, which complicates things. But is that necessarily wrong? People have different priorities and self-acceptance. The key here is whether the husband's demands are unreasonable and if the author's choice to be at her current weight is her right.\n\nAlso, the dynamic where the husband is pressuring her, and she's feeling criticized, could indicate a problem in communication or respect. The author's decision to accept her current state might be a form of self-acceptance despite external pressures. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), as the husband's expectations might be unrealistic and the author's choice is valid.\n"
