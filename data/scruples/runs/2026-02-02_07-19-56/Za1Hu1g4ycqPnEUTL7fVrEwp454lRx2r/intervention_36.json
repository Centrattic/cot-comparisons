My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The author is in a relationship where her husband wants her to reach a specific weight, which she previously achieved. She mentions that her weight has been a struggle, and she's fluctuating between certain numbers. She used to be much heavier and lost a significant amount, but her current weight is causing some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband wants her to get to 125 lbs again. The author feels that her husband doesn't understand the emotional and physical difficulty of maintaining weight loss, especially with a demanding job. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also okay with her current state. The husband is very disciplined and fit himself, which might influence his perspective.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a \"Am I the Asshole\" standpoint, the community often looks at whether someone is being unreasonable or causing harm. The author is being honest about her struggles and her acceptance of her current weight. She's not forcing her husband to be unhappy; he's expressing his preferences, which he's allowed to do, but she's also within her rights to set boundaries about her health and lifestyle choices.\n\nThe husband might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her into a standard that's unrealistic or harmful. The author mentions that maintaining the lower weight was difficult before, and she's not in a place where she can sustain it now. She's also not ignoring her health entirely, but she's choosing a balanced approach. The key here is whether the author is the one causing the issue or if the husband is being unreasonable. Since the author is acknowledging her own shortcomings but also her limitations, it seems like she's not the asshole here. The husband's expectations might be unreasonable given her history and current circumstances.\n"
