My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not trying harder to lose weight. The scenario is a long-term relationship where the husband is pushing the author to reach a specific weight, which she previously achieved. She's currently between 64-70kg, which is a significant drop from her previous 220lb. She mentions that maintaining weight is hard for her and that the husband is very disciplined, which creates tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a history of losing a lot of weight and maintaining it, but now she's struggling again due to a demanding job. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lb, which she once achieved but hasn't maintained. He's critical of her efforts, calling her lazy, and not understanding the emotional and physical challenges. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but also feels it's okay to accept her current state without strict tracking.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. From a health perspective, weight management is a personal journey with many factors like metabolism, stress, and mental health. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic if they don't consider her past struggles and current circumstances. However, the author does acknowledge that she could try harder. But the husband's approach of being critical and not understanding her challenges could be the issue here.\n\nIn terms of the relationship dynamics, mutual respect and support are crucial. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's making her feel criticized, that's probably unhealthy. The author's acceptance of her current state might be a valid choice, especially if the husband's demands are causing emotional distress. Weight is a sensitive topic, and how partners approach it can affect the relationship's health.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not meeting her husband's expectations, especially if his approach is unsupportive. However, her admission that she's not trying as hard as she could suggests some accountability. But the main issue might be the husband's lack of support and understanding. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole entirely; the problem is more about the husband's perspective and how he's handling the situation.\n"
