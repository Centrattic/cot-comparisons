My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the husband is pushing the author to reach a specific weight goal. The author has a history of weight issues and has fluctuated between 64-70kg, which is a significant improvement from her highest weight. She's currently not meeting her husband's expectations and feels it's too hard and emotional. The husband sees her as not trying hard enough, while she admits she's not giving her maximum effort but also thinks it's okay to stay as she is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The husband's perspective is that he's very disciplined and wants her to reach a certain weight, maybe for aesthetic reasons since he's fit and in the top 5% of his age group. The author, on the other hand, has struggled with her weight for a long time and now is in a maintenance phase. She's aware she could try harder but also values her current state. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. If the husband is pressuring her to meet his expectations, that's a red flag. The author's right to body autonomy is important. However, she acknowledges that she's not giving her best effort. But the question is whether her choice to maintain her current weight without drastic measures makes her the asshole.\n\nIn terms of the \"Am I the Asshole\" context, it's about social norms and what's considered acceptable. The author isn't causing harm to others, just making a personal choice. The husband's constant pressure might be the real issue here. The author is trying to balance her health and well-being with her husband's expectations. She's not being negligent in her health entirely; she's at a weight that she's maintained for years. The husband's criticism of her effort could be more toxic than the author's stance.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to maintain her current weight and not taking extreme measures. Her admission that she's not trying as hard as she could is personal, but it's her right to decide how to manage her body. The husband's pressure is more problematic. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she isn't in the wrong).\n"
