My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about weight loss and a spouse's expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a 32-year-old woman in a 7-year relationship. She's been struggling with her weight, fluctuating between 64-70kg (which is 140-154lbs for someone 5'6\"). Her husband wants her to get back down to 125lbs, which she achieved before but couldn't maintain due to a demanding job. He's disciplined and thinks she's not trying hard enough, calling her lazy. She feels the pressure but also believes it's okay to stay at her current weight without strict dieting. She's not denying she could try harder but questions if she's wrong for not meeting his expectations.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The husband's perspective is that he wants her to reach a specific weight, and he's critical of her efforts. On the other hand, the author feels the weight loss is emotionally hard and there are valid reasons like her job affecting her ability to maintain it. \n\nI need to consider factors like health, personal autonomy, and relationship dynamics. The author mentions that weight has been an ongoing debate, which might indicate that the husband's expectations are unrealistic or not considering her struggles. Also, she's aware of his perspective and admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's questioning if she's in the wrong for choosing her current lifestyle.\n\nFrom a health standpoint, the target weight (125lbs) might be below her current healthy range, especially if she's fluctuating around 140-154lbs. But BMI ranges can vary, so I shouldn't assume without more info. The key here is that the husband's demands are affecting her emotionally, and she's feeling pressured.\n\nIn terms of personal autonomy, maintaining one's body and health is a personal choice. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's unsupportive or disrespectful, that's problematic. She's not harming anyone by staying at her current weight, and the husband's criticism could be seen as disrespectful if he's not considering her challenges.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's tried before and maintained a weight loss of 70lbs is significant. That shows she's capable of making changes, but life circumstances (like a demanding job) have made it difficult. The husband's lack of understanding here could be the real issue.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and harm. If the husband is being unsupportive and the author is making a choice that's affecting her own life, it's hard to say she's in the wrong. The husband's behavior might be the issue here, not the author's decision to not meet his expectations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice about her body and health, and the husband's pressure is the problematic part here. Her admission that she's not trying as hard as she could is personal, but the question is whether she's in the wrong for not meeting his demands. The answer would lean towards her not being in the wrong because she's making a personal choice and the husband's behavior is more to blame.\n"
