My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is about a 32-year-old woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. Her weight has been a debate in their relationship. She used to be much heavier but lost 70lbs, which she kept off, but now fluctuates between 64-70kg. She had a period where she was very active and strict with her diet, reaching 125lbs, but that's not sustainable now due to a demanding job. The husband wants her to go back to 125lbs, thinking she's not trying hard enough and is lazy. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay where she is now.\n\nSo, the key points here are the ongoing pressure from the husband versus her current situation and feelings. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The husband's desire for her to reach a previous weight might be coming from a place of wanting her to be healthy, but he's also being critical and not understanding her struggles. The author is maintaining a weight she's comfortable with, even though she knows she could improve her efforts. But she's also been in this relationship for a long time, and the husband's comments might be hurtful or not respecting her autonomy over her body.\n\nIn terms of societal views, weight is a sensitive topic. The husband's approach might be seen as controlling or not supportive. The author is in a situation where she's trying to balance her health, her job, and her relationship. She's not in the same place as when she was 125lbs, and the husband not acknowledging the difficulty of maintaining weight loss is a problem. Also, the fact that she's already lost a significant amount and is now in a fluctuating range might indicate that her current efforts are sufficient for her health, even if she's not at her previous goal. The husband's insistence on a specific number without considering her emotional and physical struggles could be the issue here. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because her husband is pressuring her and she's making a personal choice about her body.\n"
