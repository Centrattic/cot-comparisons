My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. Let me start by reading through the provided text carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman in her 32nd year, married for 7 years. She's been in a relationship with her husband for over 10 years. Her weight has been a recurring issue in their relationship. She fluctuates between 64-70 kg, which is 140-154 lbs for a 5'6\" person. She mentions that when she met her husband, she was at that weight range. Before meeting him, she was much heavier (220 lbs), and she managed to lose about 70 lbs for good. However, maintaining that lower weight is a struggle for her. There was a time when she was very active and disciplined, dropping to 125 lbs, but that was before a demanding job set in. Now, her husband wants her back to 125 lbs, but he doesn't understand the emotional and practical difficulties she faces. He's disciplined and sees her current weight (which is 80% of her goal) as not being \"finished,\" implying she's not making enough effort. He accuses her of being lazy and not taking care of herself, which he thinks will lead to further weight gain as she ages. The author acknowledges that the husband's perspective is valid and that she could look better, but she also admits she's not trying as hard as she could. However, she feels it's okay to accept her current status and not track every calorie. The husband is very fit, in the top 5% of his age group.\n\nThe main question here is about whether the author is the asshole for not trying harder. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband is very disciplined and fit, which might lead to different expectations. The author has a history of significant weight loss but is now struggling to maintain it. She's in a range that's healthier than her previous weight but perhaps not as low as her husband wants. The key points are mutual expectations, the emotional aspect, and the husband's approach to the issue.\n\nThe author's current weight is within a range that's considered healthy for her height. 64-70 kg for 168 cm (5'6\") is a BMI range of roughly 22.6 to 24.7, which is normal to just over normal. So, from a health standpoint, she's not necessarily in a dangerous category. However, her husband is focused on aesthetics and wants her to reach a specific number he deems as the goal. \n\nThe author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also in a stable weight range. The husband's criticism is about her not being at 125 lbs, which is her past weight, but she's now in a phase with a demanding job, which might affect her ability to maintain strict discipline. The emotional difficulty she's facing is important; if this is causing her stress, that's a valid point. \n\nThe husband's approach seems to be judgmental, calling her lazy and projecting future weight gain. The author is choosing not to track her food meticulously, which might be her way of managing the situation given her job demands. The question is if she's wrong for not trying harder. \n\nI think the answer here is B, the author is not in the wrong. The reason is that the husband's expectations are based on his own standards and may not consider the author's health needs and lifestyle challenges. The author is maintaining a healthier weight than before and is aware of her habits. The husband's insistence on a specific number without understanding the difficulties could be the larger issue. It's also about personal choice and autonomy. Unless there's a medical reason for her to lose weight, it's her body to manage as she sees fit. The husband's behavior is more about his own preferences not being met, which might not justify the author being in the wrong.\n"
