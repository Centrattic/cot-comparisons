My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. The author has been in a relationship for 7 years and has a history of weight issues. She used to be much heavier but managed to lose 70 lbs, which she maintained for a while. Now she's fluctuating between 140-154 lbs, which is actually the same as when she met her husband.\n\n2. Her husband wants her back down to 125 lbs, which she achieved briefly before a demanding job made it hard to maintain. He thinks she's not trying hard enough and is being lazy. He's very disciplined himself, which might make him less empathetic to her struggles.\n\n3. The author acknowledges she could try harder but also feels it's okay to accept her current state. She's conflicted between her husband's expectations and her own comfort and emotional challenges around weight.\n\nNow, considering the husband's perspective, he's concerned about her health and appearance, given his own fitness. However, his approach seems to be critical and dismissive of her efforts and emotional struggles. He's framing it as a lack of effort when she's admitted it's a constant struggle. On the other hand, the author isn't refusing to try, just not as intensely. There's a balance between health and personal autonomy here. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The husband's pressure might not be entirely fair if he's not respecting her autonomy and the emotional aspects. However, she's not making an effort to improve, which could be seen as not taking his concerns seriously. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, and she's not being malicious\u2014she's just not trying as hard as he would like\u2014it's more about differing perspectives on health and responsibility. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about respect and empathy. The husband's lack of understanding might make him the asshole, but the author isn't entirely wrong for not trying harder. However, the question is specifically about the author. Since she's aware she could try harder but is choosing not to, maybe she's partially at fault. But given the complexity of weight management and her history, maybe she's not in the wrong. Hmm, this is tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether not trying harder is considered being in the wrong. If the author is content and healthy at her current weight, then she's not wrong. But if the husband's health concerns are valid and she's neglecting them, she might be. However, the scenario states that she's fluctuating between 140-154, which for her height is a normal range. So maybe she's not wrong for choosing to stay there. Therefore, answer B.\n"
