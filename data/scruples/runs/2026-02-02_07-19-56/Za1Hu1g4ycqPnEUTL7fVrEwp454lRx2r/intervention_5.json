My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is the asshole (AITA). The author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. Their main issue is her weight. She's been fluctuating between 64-70kg (which converts to around 140-154 lbs for someone 5'6\"), and she's been in a relationship with her husband for over a decade. She mentions she used to be much heavier (220 lbs) but lost 70 lbs successfully. Then there was a period where she was very active and dieting, dropping to 125 lbs, but that didn't last because of a demanding job. Now, her husband wants her to get back to that 125 lbs and is critical of her not trying harder, calling her lazy and not taking care of herself. The author is conflicted because she admits she's not trying as hard as she could but also feels it's okay to accept her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The husband is very fit and disciplined, which might influence his expectations. He might not understand the challenges she faces with her weight. The author mentions that her weight has been a constant struggle, so there might be underlying health issues or emotional factors involved. She's also said that her husband doesn't understand the emotional aspect, which suggests that his approach is more about the end goal rather than her well-being.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The author has the right to make decisions about her body. Her husband's pressure to reach a specific weight could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. However, she is acknowledging that she's not trying as hard as she could, which complicates things. But the fact that she's in a place where she's comfortable and that her husband is critical might indicate that the issue is more about his expectations than her health.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's role. He's in the top 5% fitness-wise, so his standards might be unrealistic for someone else. His criticism could be harmful, especially if it's making her feel bad about herself. The author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could suggests some self-awareness, but it doesn't necessarily mean she's in the wrong. It's possible that she's making a choice to prioritize other aspects of her life, like her job, over strict dieting.\n\nIn terms of health, there's no mention of her weight causing medical issues. The problem seems to be relational and based on her husband's preferences. The husband's lack of understanding about the difficulty she faces might be the main issue here. If he's pressuring her to reach a weight that's not necessary for her health but is important for his satisfaction, that's a problem. The author's decision to accept her current weight, even if she's not at the goal her husband wants, is about her autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's making a choice about her body despite her husband's expectations. The husband's behavior might be the issue here, as he's not respecting her decisions and is being critical. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
