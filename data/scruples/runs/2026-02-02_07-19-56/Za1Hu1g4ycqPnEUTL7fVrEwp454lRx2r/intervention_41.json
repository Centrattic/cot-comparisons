My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is the asshole for not trying harder to lose weight. The person is a woman in a 7-year relationship where her husband wants her to lose weight. She used to be heavier but managed to lose a lot, but now she's fluctuating between 64-70kg. Her husband is fit and disciplined, which might contribute to his expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user's husband is pushing her to reach a specific weight, which she previously achieved but found hard to maintain. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she also feels it's okay to stay as she is. The key points are whether the husband's pressure is valid and if the author is wrong for not meeting his expectations.\n\nWeight loss and body image are sensitive topics. The author mentions that it's emotional for her, so the husband's approach might be contributing to that stress. The husband might not understand the emotional and physical challenges involved, especially since she has a demanding job now. On the other hand, the author acknowledges she's not as disciplined as she could be, which suggests some personal responsibility.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? If the husband is pressuring her to meet his expectations without considering her well-being or the difficulty, that's an issue. The author is trying to balance her own comfort and health with her husband's desires. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The author isn't forcing herself to lose weight, but she's choosing to accept her current state. If she's not harming anyone and the husband is being unsupportive, maybe she's not the asshole. However, if the husband's concerns are about her health, that's different, but he's focusing on his own preferences.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't obligated to meet her husband's aesthetic preferences. The real issue might be the husband's lack of support and understanding. The author is honest about her struggles and the emotional aspect, so she's not being negligent. The problem seems to be on the husband's side for not respecting her efforts and boundaries.\n"
