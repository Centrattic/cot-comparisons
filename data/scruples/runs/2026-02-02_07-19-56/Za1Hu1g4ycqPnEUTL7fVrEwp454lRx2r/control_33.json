My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation involves a 7-year relationship where the author's husband is pressuring her to reach a specific weight. The author has a history of significant weight loss but is currently fluctuating in a range that's lower than her past weight but not as low as her husband wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that her weight has been a debate in the relationship. She's been at 64-70kg since meeting her husband, down from 220lb earlier. She achieved a low of 125lb but that didn't last due to a demanding job. Now her husband wants her to get back to 125lb, but she finds it hard and emotional. He's disciplined and thinks she's not trying hard enough, calling her lazy. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but thinks it's okay to stay at her current weight.\n\nThe key points here are about personal autonomy, health, and the dynamics of the relationship. Weight loss is a personal choice and can be influenced by various factors like health, lifestyle, and mental well-being. The husband's approach seems to be critical and possibly unsupportive, which can be harmful. The author is struggling and has a history of weight issues, so her current situation might involve challenges beyond just effort.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's disrespectful or unhealthy, the fault might lie with him. However, the author's admission that she could try harder might suggest some responsibility. But it's important to consider that weight management is complex and not just about effort. If the husband is not supportive and the author is making a choice to accept her current state, she isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people's health and well-being should be prioritized, and external pressure (even from a partner) can be detrimental. The author's right to make her own choices about her body is significant. So, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The author isn't refusing to try at all; she's just not pushing as hard. However, the husband's criticism might be invalidating her struggles. Therefore, the wrong might not be on her side if she's making a conscious choice that's healthy for her.\n"
