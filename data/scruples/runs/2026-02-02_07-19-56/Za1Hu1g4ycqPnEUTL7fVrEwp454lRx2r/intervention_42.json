My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (who is a woman in a 7-year relationship) is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. Her husband wants her to reach a specific goal, and she's struggling with it emotionally and finds it hard. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she also feels it's okay to stay where she is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband wants her to reach a certain weight, maybe for health or aesthetic reasons. He's disciplined in his own life, so he might think she can do the same. The author, on the other hand, has a history of weight struggles, has lost a lot of weight before, and finds it hard to maintain. She's honest about not giving her full effort but also feels satisfied with her current state.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect. The husband's desire for her to lose weight could be seen as pressuring her, especially since she's already put in effort before and faced challenges. However, the author admits she's not trying as hard as possible, which might make some think she's being indifferent to his wishes. \n\nBut weight management is personal and varies for each individual. What's manageable for one person might be difficult for another. The husband's approach might lack empathy for her struggles. The author's self-awareness that she's not trying her best is important\u2014acknowledging that she could do more but also setting boundaries on how she chooses to live her life. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to respect each other's goals and limitations. If the husband is pressuring her to meet his expectations, that could be a problem. However, the author's own admission that she's not giving her all might lead some to believe she's partially at fault for not making an effort. But others might argue that she has a right to her own body and choices, especially if her current weight is healthy.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the author is questioning her own actions and the husband's role in the pressure, it's possible that the husband's approach is more problematic. However, the fact that she's not trying as hard as she could might lead some to think she's partially in the wrong. But ultimately, the decision to prioritize one's own well-being and comfort is valid.\n"
