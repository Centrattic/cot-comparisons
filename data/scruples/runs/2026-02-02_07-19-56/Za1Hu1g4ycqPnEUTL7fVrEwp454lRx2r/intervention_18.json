My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the husband is pushing for her to reach a specific weight, which she previously achieved but found difficult to maintain. The key points here are her current weight range, her past struggles, the husband's expectations, and her own perspective on her efforts.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her weight has been a constant struggle, and she's fluctuating between 64-70kg. She used to be heavier and managed to lose 70lbs, but now she's at a point where maintaining it is hard. The husband wants her back down to 125lbs, which she achieved before but couldn't keep. He's described as very disciplined and thinks she's being lazy. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels content with her current state.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's concerned about her health and wants her to maintain a lower weight. However, from her side, she's dealing with the emotional and physical challenges of weight management, and she feels that her current weight is acceptable. She also mentions her job is demanding, which might affect her ability to maintain strict dieting.\n\nI need to consider if the husband's expectations are reasonable. He wants her to reach a weight she achieved in the past, but she's not able to maintain it now. That suggests that maybe his expectations are unrealistic given her current circumstances. Also, the fact that she's fluctuating between those weights indicates that maintaining it is a challenge for her. She's aware she's not trying as hard as possible but is content with her current situation. \n\nThe concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on whether the person is being inconsiderate or unreasonable. In this case, the author is not being harmful; she's making a choice about her body based on her own circumstances. The husband's approach might be more problematic if he's pressuring her without considering her health or the difficulty of her past weight loss. Additionally, the fact that she's admitting her own shortcomings but also standing by her decision to be comfortable as she is might show a balanced perspective.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. She's making a choice about her body, even if it's not what her partner wants. The husband's pressure could be the issue here. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
