My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the husband wants the author to reach a specific weight. The author has a history of being heavier and managed to lose a lot of weight before, but now it's a struggle. The husband's approach seems to be that he's disciplined and thinks she's being lazy. The author feels the pressure but also acknowledges she's not trying as hard as she could. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is dealing with emotional and physical challenges with weight loss, which might not be as simple as the husband's view that she's just not disciplined. Weight management can be complex, involving factors like metabolism, mental health, and medical issues. The husband's perspective is that she's not doing enough, but maybe he's not considering the underlying reasons.\n\nThe author mentions that her weight is a constant struggle and that it's hard for her to keep it down. This suggests it's not just about willpower. Also, she's in a demanding job, which could affect her ability to maintain strict diet and exercise. The husband's comparison to his own discipline might not be fair if he's not accounting for her specific challenges.\n\nThe author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, which shows some self-awareness. However, she also feels it's okay to stay as she is. This could be a valid choice for her, given the difficulty she's facing. The question is whether not trying harder makes her the asshole. \n\nIn arguments about health and relationships, it's important to note that one person's health choices don't necessarily harm others unless there's direct harm. The husband might have preferences based on aesthetics, but if it's not affecting health, it's his issue. The author's struggle should be respected. However, if the author is resistant to any change despite acknowledging she could try harder, that might be a point of contention. \n\nBut the key here is that the author is not being harmful. She's aware of the situation and making a choice that's right for her, even if it's not what her husband wants. The husband's frustration might stem from his own standards, but the author's decision to accept her current state is a personal choice. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. \n\nBut then, the author admits she's not trying as hard as she could. If she has the capacity to try harder and improve her health, but isn't, does that make her at fault? However, the context shows that weight loss is challenging for her, and she's been through a lot. The husband's approach might be dismissive of her struggles. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for partners to support each other. If the husband is pushing her without understanding her challenges, he might be the one in the wrong. The author's admission of not trying as hard could be seen as a personal struggle rather than a moral failing. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), because the author is making a personal choice based on her own struggles, and the husband's expectations might be unrealistic or unsupportive.\n"
