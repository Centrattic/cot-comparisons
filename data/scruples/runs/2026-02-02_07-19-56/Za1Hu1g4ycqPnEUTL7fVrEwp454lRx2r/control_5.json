My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight in her relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in a 7-year relationship. She's been struggling with her weight, fluctuating between 64-70kg and standing at 168cm. She used to be much heavier but managed to lose 70lbs before, but her current weight is a point of contention with her husband. The husband wants her to get back to 125lbs and doesn't understand her struggles, thinking she's not trying hard enough. He's disciplined and fit himself, which might add pressure on her.\n\nShe feels that while she could try harder, she's also okay with her current weight and doesn't want to micromanage her diet. The question is whether she's the asshole for not trying harder and accepting her current weight.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the husband's intentions might be to support her health, but his approach seems dismissive of her emotional and physical challenges. Weight loss isn't just about willpower; it can involve complex factors like metabolism, stress, and mental health. The author mentions it's hard and emotional for her, which the husband doesn't seem to acknowledge. He's labeling her as lazy, which is unhelpful and could be harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author admits she's not trying as hard as she could. But she also feels it's okay to be at her current weight. The key here is mutual understanding and respect. The husband isn't respecting her boundaries and her struggles, while the author is trying to set her own standards. Since the husband's criticism is causing emotional distress and he's not being supportive, maybe the issue isn't just on the author. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder.\n\nWait, the user is asking if she's wrong. If she's already made a conscious choice to be at her current weight and feels her husband isn't being supportive, then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if her acceptance of the status quo is due to not making any effort, maybe she could be seen as not trying. But the problem here is the husband's approach. The author is seeking validation for her current situation, which might be healthier for her mentally, even if it doesn't meet her husband's expectations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's constant pressure and lack of understanding are the main issues. The author is trying to balance her health and happiness, and it's her body. Unless there are health risks, she's not necessarily in the wrong for choosing her current lifestyle. Therefore, the answer would be B, No, she's not the asshole.\n"
