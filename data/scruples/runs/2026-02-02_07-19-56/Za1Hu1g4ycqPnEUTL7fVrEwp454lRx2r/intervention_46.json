My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a woman and her husband having a disagreement about weight loss.\n\nFirst, I need to recap the details. The woman is 32, in a 7-year relationship. She was heavier in the past (220lbs) but lost 70lbs, now fluctuating between 140-154lbs. She was down to 125lbs briefly but couldn't maintain it. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lbs and is critical of her not trying hard enough. She feels it's hard and emotional, and she's not as strict with her habits as her husband, who is very fit. She's admitting she's not trying as hard but thinks it's okay to stay at her current weight.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder and accepting her current weight. The user initially thinks she is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nNow, considering societal views on weight and health, there's a lot to unpack. Weight loss can be challenging for many reasons\u2014metabolism, stress, lifestyle, etc. The woman mentions it's hard and emotional for her. Her husband's approach seems to be more about discipline (he's in top 5% fitness), which might not align with her experience.\n\nThe key points here: The woman is being honest about her struggles and acknowledges she's not as strict. She's not refusing to try but is choosing a different approach. The husband is pressuring her to reach a specific number, which he sees as achievable through discipline, but she feels it's not that simple for her. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, the question is about her not trying harder. But weight management is personal. It's not just about effort; it's also about biology, mental health, and individual circumstances. The woman is accepting her current weight, which might be a healthy choice for her. The husband's criticism could be seen as not respecting her autonomy and her challenges.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if she's aware she's not trying as hard as she could, then there's room for improvement. But the main issue here is the pressure from the husband and the judgment of her efforts. The author isn't causing harm to others by staying at her current weight. The problem might be more about the husband's expectations and lack of empathy towards her struggles.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). She's making a choice that's right for her, even if it doesn't meet her husband's standards. The conflict arises from differing perspectives and expectations, not necessarily from her being wrong.\n"
