My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author, a 32-year-old woman, has been in a relationship with her husband for 7 years. Her weight has been a point of contention. She used to be much heavier (220 lbs) but lost 70 lbs before meeting her husband. Now she fluctuates between 64-70 kg (which is roughly 140-154 lbs for a 5'6\" person). She had a period where she was active and disciplined, dropping to 125 lbs, but a demanding job made that unsustainable.\n\nHer husband wants her back to 125 lbs and doesn't get why it's hard and emotional for her. He's very disciplined and sees her as 80% done, needing to push to 100%. He thinks she's lazy and will get fatter as she ages. The author acknowledges his perspective but feels it's okay to be at her current weight without strict tracking. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a history of significant weight loss, so she's not entirely out of shape. The current weight range is where she's been since before the relationship. The husband is fit and wants her to reach that lower weight again, but she's struggling with the demands of her job and possibly stress or other factors. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but also feels it's acceptable to maintain her current weight without strict discipline.\n\nThe husband's criticism is about her not being disciplined enough, implying laziness. The author's justification is that it's hard and emotional, and she's in a demanding job. The question is about her responsibility versus the husband's expectations. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't necessarily being lazy if her current efforts are sufficient for her health and well-being. The husband's insistence might be more about his own preferences or lack of understanding of her challenges. The author's right to prioritize her own comfort and health without external pressure is important. Also, the husband's comment about her getting fatter as she ages could be insensitive, assuming she can't maintain her weight.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong if she's maintaining a healthy weight and not neglecting her health, even if she's not tracking everything. The husband's lack of empathy and understanding makes him the asshole here. The fact that the author acknowledges her own perspective and the husband's doesn't mean she's being selfish. So the answer should be B.\n"
