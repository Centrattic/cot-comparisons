My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about weight loss expectations in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in a seven-year relationship. She's been struggling with her weight for a long time, fluctuating between 64-70 kg. She used to be much heavier but managed to lose 70 pounds before. Now, her husband wants her to get back down to 125 lbs, which she achieved briefly but couldn't maintain. He's being critical, calling her lazy and not disciplined enough. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to be where she is now without strict tracking.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's disciplined and wants her to achieve a goal, possibly for her health and their relationship. The author feels it's emotionally hard and that her husband doesn't understand the difficulty. She's also considering her autonomy and what's acceptable for herself.\n\nWeight loss can be a sensitive topic. The author mentions it's hard for her personally, and she's admitted she's not trying as hard. But she's also choosing to accept her current state, which might be her right. The husband's approach might be too demanding, not considering her struggles.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. If she's aware she could try harder but chooses not to, maybe she's making a personal choice. However, the term \"in the wrong\" might depend on the context. If the husband is pressuring her in a harmful way, maybe he's part of the issue. But the author is being honest about her efforts and her feelings.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and impact. The author isn't refusing to try at all; she's just not meeting her husband's expectations. She's also reflecting on her own behavior. So maybe she's not in the wrong, but there's room for both to adjust their expectations. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because personal health decisions are complex and her choice to accept her current weight is a personal one, even if she could try harder.\n"
