My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation involves a couple where the husband wants her to reach a specific weight, and she's struggling with it.\n\nFirst, the author mentions her weight has been a struggle for years. She used to be heavier but lost 70 pounds, which is a significant achievement. Now she's in a range between 140-154 lbs, which she's had since meeting her husband. She tried a phase of intense exercise and discipline, getting down to 125 lbs, but that didn't last due to a demanding job. \n\nHer husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs, but she finds it hard and emotional. He's disciplined and doesn't understand her struggles, thinking she's lazy. She admits she could try harder but also thinks it's okay to stay as she is. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not pushing harder and accepting her current weight.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband's desire for her to lose weight might stem from concern for her health and wanting her to look better, given his own fitness. However, the author has a history of weight struggles and a physically demanding job, which could affect her ability to maintain strict diets/exercise. She's also in a long-term relationship, so maybe expectations have changed over time.\n\nThe key points are her past achievements, current challenges, and mutual expectations. The husband's lack of understanding could be an issue. The author isn't being lazy per se, but maybe she's realistic about her current situation. If she's trying but not as hard as possible, maybe she is the one not trying hard enough. Or maybe the husband is unrealistic.\n\nIn terms of societal views, sometimes people judge others for not meeting others' expectations, especially in relationships. But personal health journeys are complex. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, which suggests she feels some responsibility. However, the husband's pressure might be part of the problem. The question is about whether she's the asshole, which is about being inconsiderate or wrong. \n\nIf she's making a conscious choice to stay at her current weight despite her husband's wishes, but she's aware of her own shortcomings (not trying hard enough), then maybe she is in the wrong. But if the husband isn't supportive and is pressuring her, she might have valid reasons for her stance. The answer hinges on whether her choice to not try harder is unfair to her husband's wishes or if his expectations are unreasonable.\n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. Since the author admits she could try harder but is choosing not to, maybe that's where she's at fault. However, the husband's lack of empathy might also play a role. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. If she's not making the effort she could, then maybe she is in the wrong. But if her reasons are valid and she's struggling, perhaps not. The answer is likely A or B depending on interpretation.\n"
