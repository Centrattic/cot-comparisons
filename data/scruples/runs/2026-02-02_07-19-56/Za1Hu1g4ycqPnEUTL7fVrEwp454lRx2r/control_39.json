My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the husband wants her to reach a specific weight, and she's struggling with it emotionally and physically.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a history of significant weight loss, going from 220lb to 125lb, but her current weight fluctuates between 64-70kg. The husband is very disciplined and expects her to reach 125lb again, calling her lazy. The author feels the pressure is emotional and that her husband doesn't understand her struggles. She's not trying as hard as she could, but also feels it's okay to accept her current state.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should think about body autonomy, unhealthy pressures in relationships, and the fact that weight loss isn't just about willpower. The husband's comments about her being lazy and not taking care of herself are likely hurtful and judgmental. The author's admission that she isn't trying as hard as she could might make some think she's at fault, but societal pressures and the unrealistic expectations of a partner could play a role here.\n\nAlso, the husband's fitness level might contribute to his perspective, but that doesn't justify pressuring her. The author's health and well-being are important. If the husband is creating a toxic environment with his comments, that's his issue. The author's choice to not obsess over her weight might be a healthy decision for herself, even if it frustrates her partner.\n\nIn many cases, relationships should respect each other's boundaries and health. The husband's approach seems controlling and not supportive. The author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful to others by maintaining her current weight and lifestyle. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
