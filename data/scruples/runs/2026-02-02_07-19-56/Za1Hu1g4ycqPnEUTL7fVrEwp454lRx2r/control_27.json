My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a woman in a 7-year relationship who's struggling with her weight. She's between 64-70 kg, which is her current range. She used to be heavier but managed to lose a significant amount, reaching 125 lb once. Now her husband wants her to get back to that weight, but she finds it emotionally hard and isn't trying as hard as she could. The husband is disciplined, fit, and in the top 5% of his age group. He doesn't understand why she's struggling and thinks she's not making enough effort.\n\nFirst, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The user is asking if she's the asshole (AITA). The possible answers are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband's viewpoint is that he wants her to achieve a weight he deems ideal, maybe for her health or appearance. He might feel concerned about her well-being. However, the wife's side is that weight loss is emotionally challenging for her, and she's not as disciplined as her husband. She's content with her current weight and doesn't want to meticulously track her diet. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while she admits she could try harder, she also mentions the difficulty. Weight loss isn't just about effort; it's also about biological factors, mental health, and personal habits. Her husband's lack of understanding about her struggles might be the issue here. He's imposing his standards without considering her emotional and physical challenges. \n\nThe husband's perspective might stem from his own discipline and success in fitness, leading him to believe the same approach should work for her. However, everyone's different. She's managing her weight within a range that's sustainable for her, which is a common issue many people face. The key here is mutual respect and understanding. If the husband is pressuring her constantly, that's problematic. \n\nThe user isn't necessarily wrong for not trying harder. It's a personal choice influenced by her body's response and her mental health. The husband's lack of support and empathy might be the real issue here. The question is about who is in the wrong, and the answer hinges on whether the wife's choice is valid despite her husband's disapproval. Since she's honest about her efforts and the difficulty, and her husband isn't considering her perspective, she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
