My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a woman in her 30s who's been married for seven years. She's had a weight struggle, going from 220 lbs down to around 140-154 lbs. Her husband wants her to get back down to 125 lbs, but she finds it hard and emotional. He's very disciplined and thinks she's not trying hard enough, maybe even lazy. She's asking if she's the asshole for not trying harder and staying at her current weight.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author has a history of significant weight loss but finds it hard to maintain. She's fluctuating in a range that's lower than her past weight. Her husband is pushing for more weight loss, which she feels is not realistic for her. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but also thinks it's okay to stay as she is. The husband is fit and disciplined, which might color his perspective.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but I need to evaluate.\n\nWeight loss and maintenance can be really challenging. The author has a history of successful weight loss, which shows she's capable, but maintaining it is hard. She mentions that her current job is demanding, which might affect her ability to stick to a strict regimen. Also, she points out that her husband doesn't understand the emotional difficulty, which could indicate a communication issue rather than her fault.\n\nThe husband's expectations might be unrealistic. He wants her to reach a certain weight, but he doesn't consider the complexities of weight management, especially long-term. His criticism about her being lazy is harsh and could be hurtful. The author is trying to balance her health and her husband's desires, which isn't easy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author admits she's not trying as hard as she could. That's a self-aware statement, but it's also subjective. What's \"trying harder\" for her versus her husband? If she's making an effort but not meeting his expectations, it's not necessarily her fault if the effort isn't enough. Weight management isn't just about effort; it's also about biology, lifestyle, and mental health.\n\nThe key here is whether the husband's demands are reasonable. He's not understanding her struggles and is labeling her laziness. That's a problem on his part. The author's decision to accept her current weight as okay might be a healthy choice for her, especially if she's not harming anyone. The husband's fitness level doesn't give him the right to criticize her efforts without empathy.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's in a difficult situation with a partner who isn't supportive in the right way. Her admission of not trying as hard as she could is honest, but the main issue is the husband's lack of understanding and his unrealistic expectations. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
