My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about weight loss and a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman who's been in a 7-year relationship. Her husband wants her to lose more weight. She's fluctuating between 64-70kg. She used to be much heavier and managed to lose 70 pounds, but now it's a struggle. She had a phase where she was very disciplined and hit 125lbs, but her job became demanding. Now her husband is pushing her to get back to that weight, but she finds it hard and emotional. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but feels it's okay to accept her current weight. The husband is very fit and disciplined, which might contribute to his perspective.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The user thinks she is, but wants others' opinions.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's concern might come from a place of wanting his partner to be healthy. But weight loss can be complex due to biological factors, emotional issues, and lifestyle constraints. The author mentions that it's hard for her, and that her job is demanding, which affects her ability to diet and exercise. She's also been through a significant weight loss before, which shows she has the capability, but now it's a struggle.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The author has the right to make decisions about her own body. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's making her feel bad or not respecting her choices, that's an issue. The author admits she's not trying as hard, but that's her choice. She's not harming anyone by maintaining her current weight. However, if she's aware of health risks and is consciously choosing not to address them, that's a personal decision. But the husband's role in this is also important. If he's constantly criticizing her, that could be toxic.\n\nThe author's mention of emotional struggle suggests that weight loss isn't just about willpower for her. There might be underlying issues like metabolism, mental health, or other factors. The husband's approach of not understanding her struggle might be part of the problem.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while health is important, body image pressure from a partner can be problematic. The author's acceptance of her current state could be a healthy choice, especially if she's not in immediate health danger. The husband's insistence on reaching a specific number might be more about his own standards than her health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She has the right to choose her lifestyle, even if it doesn't meet her partner's expectations. The husband's lack of support and understanding might be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
