My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The author is in a long-term relationship and has had weight issues, having lost a lot of weight before but now fluctuating. Her husband wants her to get back to her lowest weight, which she achieved before but couldn't maintain. He's pushing her to be more disciplined, but she feels it's emotional and hard for her. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but also thinks it's okay to stay as she is.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dynamics between the husband and wife. The husband's expectations might be coming from his own discipline and fitness goals, but the author is struggling with emotional and practical challenges. Weight loss isn't just about effort; it's also about mental health, metabolism, and other factors. The husband's approach could be dismissive of her struggles, seeing her as lazy, which isn't fair. The author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could might make people think she's in the wrong, but given the context of her past success and current challenges, maybe not. The question is whether not trying harder is her fault.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, it's often about mutual understanding. The husband might not realize how hard it is for her, while her not making an effort could be her choice. But since she's aware of her own shortcomings and the husband's perspective, maybe she's not entirely in the wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's pressure is unreasonable versus her responsibility to her health. But the question is specifically about her being in the wrong for not trying harder. If she's making a conscious choice to accept her current weight despite knowing she could do more, maybe she's not the asshole. However, if the husband's concerns are valid about health issues, but he's approaching it in a way that's critical, that's his fault too. The Reddit dynamic often looks for who's being unreasonable. The author might not be in the wrong because she's managing her own body and the husband's expectations might be unrealistic.\n"
