My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about weight loss and a relationship. The author, a woman in her 30s, has a history of being heavier but lost a significant amount before. Now she's in a weight range that's been an issue in her relationship with her husband. He wants her to get back to 125lb, which she achieved before but couldn't maintain due to a demanding job. She's now fluctuating between 140-154lb. The husband is disciplined and fit, and he's pushing her to lose more weight, thinking she's not trying hard enough. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay as she is.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's the asshole for not trying harder. The possible answers are A or B. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the author has a history of weight issues but managed to lose a lot. Now, she's in a maintenance phase but it's a struggle. Her husband's expectations might be unrealistic. He wants her to reach a weight she achieved before but couldn't keep up long-term. The key here is that she's already at a lower weight than her peak and is struggling to maintain. \n\nThe husband's approach is possibly critical and not considering her past efforts and the challenges she faces. The author is acknowledging her own shortcomings but also setting boundaries about how she wants to live her life. Weight loss isn't just about effort; it's also about biology, lifestyle, and mental health. Forcing someone to adhere to a strict regimen can be unhealthy, especially if it's causing emotional distress. \n\nHer admitting she's not trying as hard as she could but feeling it's okay to stay as is suggests that she's aware of the situation but has chosen a different path. This could indicate that she's making a personal choice about her body, which others might not have the right to criticize. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel concerned about her health or their relationship dynamics. However, his methods might be harmful if they're making her feel lazy or inadequate without understanding her struggles. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and comfort. Everyone has different standards for themselves, and it's possible she's found a balance that's sustainable for her. The husband's expectations might not be fair if they ignore her past efforts and current circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's making a personal choice based on her own experiences and challenges, even if she's aware she could try harder. The situation involves personal autonomy and realistic expectations.\n"
