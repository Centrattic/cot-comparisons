My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a woman who's been in a 7-year relationship with her husband. She's been struggling with her weight for a long time, fluctuating between 64-70kg, which is around 140-154lbs. She was much heavier before, around 220lbs, and managed to lose 70lbs, which she's kept off. At one point she got down to 125lbs, but that didn't last because of a demanding job. Now her husband wants her to get back to 125lbs, but he doesn't understand the emotional and physical difficulty of maintaining weight loss. He's disciplined, which makes sense since he's top 5% fit in his age group. The woman feels he doesn't get that she's tried before and it's not just about being lazy. She's considering whether she's the asshole for not trying harder and staying at her current weight.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, weight loss is a personal and complex issue. The author has a history of significant weight loss and has maintained a healthier weight compared to her past. She's currently in a range that's higher than her lowest but within her previous fluctuations. The husband is pushing for a specific goal, which she's found difficult to maintain before. She's acknowledging she's not trying as hard as she could, but she also feels it's okay to be at her current state.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual understanding and respect. The husband's expectations might stem from his own disciplined lifestyle, but he's not considering her past struggles and the emotional aspect. The author is struggling with the balance between her husband's expectations and her own health and well-being. She's not in denial about her weight but is trying to find a middle ground where she's not obsessing over every calorie.\n\nWeight management isn't just about willpower; it's influenced by metabolism, genetics, mental health, and lifestyle factors. The husband's approach might be too rigid, not accounting for the complexity of the author's situation. The author isn't necessarily being lazy; she's trying to manage a long-term health challenge. It's possible that the husband's expectations are unrealistic, given her history of fluctuating weight and the difficulty of maintaining a very low weight after a demanding job.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to support each other's health goals without pressuring them into extremes. The author is seeking a balance between her own well-being and her husband's desires. She's not in the wrong for prioritizing her health and happiness, especially if pushing for the lower weight would be detrimental to her mental health. The husband's perspective is valid in that he wants his partner to be healthy, but he needs to be more empathetic towards her struggles.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. Her situation is complex, and her efforts to maintain a healthy lifestyle, despite her husband's expectations, show that she's trying her best. The husband's lack of understanding and the pressure he's applying might be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
