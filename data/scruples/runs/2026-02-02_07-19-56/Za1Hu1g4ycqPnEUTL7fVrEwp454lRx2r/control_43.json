My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight, based on the situation they described. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. She's been fluctuating between 64-70kg (140-154lb) and is 168cm tall. She used to be much heavier (220lb) and managed to lose 70lb before. She had a phase where she was disciplined with exercise and diet, reaching 125lb, but due to a demanding job, she couldn't maintain it. Now, her husband wants her to reach 125lb again and doesn't understand the emotional and physical challenges she faces. He's critical, thinking she's lazy and not taking care of herself. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay at her current weight. The husband is very fit and disciplined, which might add pressure.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The answer depends on perspectives. On one hand, the husband's expectations might be unrealistic, given her history and current challenges. On the other, she acknowledges she's not trying her hardest but chooses to accept her current state. \n\nI need to consider factors like health, personal autonomy, and relationship dynamics. Weight loss isn't just about willpower; it involves biological, psychological, and lifestyle factors. The husband's approach might be dismissive of these complexities. The author isn't harming anyone by staying at her current weight unless it's affecting her health. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which could relate to personal responsibility versus respecting her choices.\n\nBut the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually looks at social norms and whether the person is being unreasonable. If the author is making a choice that's affecting her health or the relationship negatively, maybe she's at fault. However, since she's aware of the issue and the husband's perspective but chooses not to change, it's a personal decision. \n\nThe key points: the husband's criticism is pushing her to be \"100%\", implying she's not done until she reaches his goal. The author's struggle is real, and she's admitting fault in not trying harder but also feeling it's okay. The husband's expectations might be the problem here, not the author. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whose behavior is inappropriate. The husband's constant pushing and not understanding her challenges could be the issue, but the author's acceptance of her current state isn't necessarily wrong. She's honest about her situation, which shows self-awareness. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because she's making a personal choice about her body, and the husband's expectations might be unrealistic and critical without considering her struggles.\n"
