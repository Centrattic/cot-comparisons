My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman in a 7-year relationship) is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight, as per her husband's expectations.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of being much heavier, around 220 lbs, but managed to lose 70 lbs to reach her current weight range. She's been fluctuating between 140-154 lbs for years. She used to be more active and disciplined, reaching 125 lbs, but that fizzled out due to a demanding job. Now, her husband wants her back to 125 lbs, but she finds it hard and emotional. He's disciplined himself, which she acknowledges, but she feels he doesn't understand her struggles. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but also thinks it's okay to accept her current state.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author has a personal history of weight issues and has successfully lost weight before, 2) She's currently in a weight range that's been stable for years, and 3) The husband's expectations might be unrealistic given her circumstances.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate. The author is reflecting on her own efforts and acknowledging she's not trying as hard as possible. However, she's also balancing her current lifestyle and job demands. The husband, while supportive in acknowledging her efforts, is pushing for a specific goal that she finds emotionally challenging.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, it's often considered that individuals should take personal responsibility for their health. However, the situation also involves personal autonomy and respect for individual choices. The husband's pressure might be coming from a place of concern, but it's important to consider if it's healthy to impose such expectations in a relationship. The author is trying to find a middle ground between her husband's desires and her own well-being.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's aware of her habits and is honest about her efforts. The husband's perspective is valid in terms of wanting support, but the author's struggle with weight and the emotional aspect are valid too. The decision to accept her current state isn't laziness but a recognition of her own limits and circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
