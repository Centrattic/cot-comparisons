My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a 32-year-old woman who's been in a relationship with her husband for seven years. Her weight has been a point of contention. She used to be much heavier, around 220 lbs, but she lost 70 lbs before meeting her husband and has been fluctuating between 140-154 lbs now. Her husband wants her to drop to 125 lbs again, which she achieved through intense exercise and discipline. But since she got a demanding job, she couldn't maintain that. The husband is very disciplined and doesn't understand why it's hard for her. He thinks she's lazy and will get fatter as she ages. The author admits she isn't trying as hard as she could but thinks it's okay to stay as she is now without tracking her food meticulously.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is the asshole for not trying harder and accepting her current weight. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze both sides.\n\nThe author's side: She's managed to lose a significant amount of weight before and has struggled to keep it. She's in a fluctuating range now, which might be her maintenance level. She has a demanding job, which could affect her ability to maintain strict discipline. She also mentions it's emotional for her, indicating past struggles and possibly a history of disordered eating or body image issues. She admits she isn't trying as hard as she could, so there's self-awareness. However, she feels it's okay to be at her current weight, which is a reasonable stance because weight isn't just about effort; it's also about metabolism, stress, and other factors. She's not ignoring her health but is choosing a balance that works for her life.\n\nThe husband's side: He's very disciplined and fit, so he might hold himself to high standards. He's concerned about her health and appearance, suggesting he wants her to look better. His approach is to push for weight loss, but he might not fully understand the complexities she faces. He's critical of her effort, calling her lazy, which can be hurtful and may not consider her personal challenges. His desire for her to reach a specific weight could be influenced by his own preferences rather than her health. The fact that he's in the top 5% of his age group in fitness might contribute to his expectations, but that doesn't mean his perspective is valid for his partner.\n\nNow, the key points here are mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't refusing to try at all; she's just not willing to exert the same level of discipline she had before, especially considering her job's demands. The husband's criticism implies that her current effort is insufficient, but he might be overlooking the reasons behind her fluctuation. Weight management can be difficult, and people often struggle with it, so the author's admission that it's hard and emotional is a red flag for potential disordered eating or chronic stress. The husband's approach of pushing for a specific weight without considering her feelings or the practical challenges (like job stress) could be harmful. \n\nAdditionally, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder. If she's already making some effort but the husband is not respecting her boundaries or mental well-being, then maybe he's the one in the wrong. However, if she's not making a genuine effort at all, then the husband might have a point. But the author says she's \"not trying as hard as I could,\" which suggests she is trying but not to the extent he wants. The husband's insistence on his own standard of discipline without considering her personal circumstances could be the issue here. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to respect each other's choices and health journeys. The husband's focus on her reaching a specific weight and his judgmental attitude might be more about his own preferences than her actual health. The author's current weight might be a healthy range for her, and her approach to not meticulously track everything could be a sustainable balance. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's making a conscious choice to manage her weight in a way that's sustainable for her, while the husband's demands could be seen as unrealistic and not empathetic. Therefore, the answer might be B, but I need to make sure. The author's admission of not trying as hard might mean she's partially at fault, but the husband's role in pressuring her and not understanding her challenges is a bigger issue. The concept of \"AITA\" often considers if the person is being unreasonable, but in this case, the husband's expectations seem to be the main problem. So the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
