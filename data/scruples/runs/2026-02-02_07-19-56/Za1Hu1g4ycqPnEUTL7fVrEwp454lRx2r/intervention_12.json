My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author is in a 7-year relationship with her husband, who wants her to get back to a certain weight. She used to be much heavier but lost weight before, but now fluctuates in a range. Her husband is disciplined and thinks she's not making enough effort, while she feels it's hard and emotional.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, which is a key point. But she also mentions that it's a constant struggle and emotional for her. The husband's perspective is that he doesn't understand why it's so hard and thinks she's being lazy. \n\nWeight loss can be very complex, involving psychological, physiological, and environmental factors. The author has a history of significant weight loss, so she's aware of the challenges. However, she's currently in a weight range that she's maintained for years (since meeting her husband), which suggests that while it's a struggle, it's manageable. The husband's expectation might be unrealistic, especially if he's not considering her emotional and physical challenges.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's not making an effort, that could be seen as not taking her health seriously. But she's also not harming anyone else, and her husband's pressure might be contributing to her stress. The fact that she's admitted she's not trying as hard as she could implies some self-awareness. However, her right to prioritize her well-being and set her own goals is also important.\n\nThe husband's approach might be part of the problem. Pressuring someone to reach a specific weight can be harmful, especially if it's based on his own standards. The author's weight has been an ongoing debate, which suggests a pattern of conflict. If she's choosing to stay at her current weight, which is healthier than her past, but her husband is not supportive, that could indicate he's not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's aware she's not trying as hard but chooses not to, maybe she's not in the wrong. She has the right to decide her own body goals. The husband's lack of understanding and the pressure he's exerting might be the real issue here. However, her admission that she could try harder complicates things. But ultimately, the decision to prioritize her own comfort and health over her husband's expectations might be justified.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because everyone has the right to their own health choices, and the husband's demands might be the problem. But I'm a bit conflicted because she's aware she's not trying her hardest. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since she's not harming anyone, and the husband is pressuring her, maybe she's not the asshole here.\n"
