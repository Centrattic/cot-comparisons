My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about weight and a relationship. The author is a 32-year-old woman who's been with her husband for seven years, known him for ten. She's fluctuating between 64-70kg when she's 168cm tall. She was much heavier before meeting him, around 220lbs (which is about 100kg), but she successfully lost about 70lbs. She mentions she had a short phase where she was very active and disciplined, hitting 125lbs, but that job became too demanding, and she couldn't maintain it. Now, her husband wants her back to 125lbs, but she's struggling and doesn't want to track everything she eats anymore. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay as she is. The husband is fit, in the top 5% of his age group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is feeling pressure from her husband to lose more weight, even though she's already lost a significant amount. She's now at a weight range that's been her fluctuation, and she's feeling the emotional struggle. The husband, being very disciplined, probably sees weight as a matter of willpower and effort. He might not understand the complexities or the emotional toll it takes on her. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and understanding. The author is in control of her health and body choices. The husband is expressing his desire, but it's important to note that he's not a medical professional, so his advice might not be the healthiest. The author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could might lead some to think she's at fault, but that's not necessarily the case. Weight loss is a personal decision and should be based on health and personal goals, not just a partner's wishes. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The husband's pressure could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. The author has a history of significant weight loss, which is commendable, and now she's at a weight that's hard to maintain. If she feels that the husband's demands are unrealistic or not considering her well-being, then she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own health and happiness. \n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is crucial. If the husband is making her feel lazy or that her current state is unacceptable, that's a red flag in the relationship. The author's right to set boundaries about her health is important. The husband's fitness doesn't mean his partner should conform to his standards. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice that's okay for her, even if it's less than her previous goal. The husband's push for her to reach that weight might be more about his own preferences than her health. The answer should be B.\n"
