My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about weight loss in a relationship. The author is a woman in her 30s who's been with her husband for seven years. She's been fluctuating between 64-70kg, which is around 140-154lb, and she's 5'6\". She used to be heavier, like 220lb, and managed to lose 70lb, but maintaining that weight is hard. She had a phase where she was really active and disciplined, dropping to 125lb, but then a demanding job made it hard to keep up. Now her husband wants her to go back to 125lb, thinking she's not trying hard enough and that she's lazy. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she also feels it's okay to be where she is now. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder and accepting her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's perspective is that he's concerned about her health and appearance, given that he's very fit. He might think that she's capable of more rigorous effort since she's maintained a lower weight before. On the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional and practical challenges\u2014like a demanding job\u2014that make it hard to stick to a strict regimen. She's also fluctuating in weight, which indicates that it's not just a matter of effort but possibly other factors like metabolism, stress, or lifestyle.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's expectations versus her capabilities and circumstances. The author is honest about not trying as hard as she could, which suggests some self-awareness. However, she's also asserting her right to be comfortable at her current weight, which might be a matter of personal choice. The husband's criticism that she's lazy could be harsh, especially if he's not considering the emotional and physical challenges she faces. \n\nWeight loss isn't just about willpower; it's influenced by many factors. The author's history of significant weight loss shows she has the capability, but maintaining it is a different challenge. If her husband is pressuring her to reach a specific number without understanding her struggles, that could be an issue. However, the author's admission that she's not trying her hardest might mean she's not fully committed, but it's also about priorities and what she's willing to sacrifice.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's choosing to accept her current state despite knowing she could do more, maybe there's some responsibility there. But the husband's approach might be part of the problem if he's not supportive or understanding. The question is about whether her not trying harder makes her the asshole. Since she's aware of her shortcomings but chooses to be content, perhaps she's not entirely in the wrong because weight management is complex. But if she's not making an effort at all, then maybe. However, the post says she's \"not trying as hard as she could,\" not that she's doing nothing. So there's some effort, just not enough. It's a balance between personal choice and health. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's expectations are unreasonable and if the author's choice is a personal one.\n"
