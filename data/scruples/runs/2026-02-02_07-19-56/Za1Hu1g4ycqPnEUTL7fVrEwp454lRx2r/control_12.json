My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author's husband wants her to reach a specific weight (125lb) and is criticizing her for not being more disciplined. The author acknowledges that she's not trying as hard as she could but also feels it's okay to be at her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband wants his wife to lose weight, maybe for health or aesthetic reasons. He's very disciplined himself, which might make him see weight loss as something achievable with enough effort. On the other hand, the author has a history of significant weight loss and regain, and she mentions that maintaining weight is hard for her. She's also aware that her current weight is higher than her goal but is okay with it.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and personal choices. The author isn't harming anyone else with her weight, and weight loss is a complex issue that isn't just about willpower. The husband's pressure might be coming from a place of concern, but it's important to respect individual body autonomy. The author isn't obligated to meet her husband's expectations. Also, she's honest about her current efforts, which shows self-awareness.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a growing understanding that body positivity is important and that health isn't just about weight. The author isn't refusing to try entirely; she's just choosing a different level of effort. The husband's insistence on a specific weight could be seen as pressuring her into a standard that's not necessarily healthy or realistic for her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to make choices about her body, even if they don't align with her partner's preferences. The answer should be B.\n"
