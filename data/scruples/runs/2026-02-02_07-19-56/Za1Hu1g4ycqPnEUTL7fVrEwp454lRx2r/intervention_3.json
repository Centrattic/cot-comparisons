My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author and her husband have been together for a long time. She's been struggling with her weight, fluctuating between 64-70 kg, which is higher than her previous goal of 125 lb. Her husband wants her to reach that weight again and is critical of her not trying hard enough, even calling her lazy. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels okay staying at her current weight without strict tracking.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the expectations the husband has versus the author's self-perception and efforts. The husband is very disciplined and fit, so he might have high standards. The author used to be much heavier and did lose weight before, but now finds it hard to maintain. She's in a job that's demanding, which might affect her ability to stay on track. She also mentions it's emotional for her, which suggests there's more to it than just willpower.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. On one hand, she acknowledges she could try harder and that her husband has a valid point about appearance. On the other hand, she's struggling with emotional issues and life circumstances (like a demanding job) that make it difficult. The husband's approach might be unsupportive, given the emotional aspect and the fact that weight loss isn't just about effort for everyone.\n\nThe author is trying to balance her husband's expectations with her own well-being. If she's not in the wrong, it might be because her husband's expectations are unrealistic or not considering her personal challenges. If she's in the wrong, it could be because she's not making sufficient effort given her past success and her husband's support (even if it's harsh).\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the husband's criticism is supportive or just critical. The author is trying to find a middle ground, but maybe the husband isn't being supportive enough. The author's justification for staying at her current weight could be valid if she's maintaining a healthy lifestyle, even if it's not the weight her husband wants. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she's making choices that are right for her, even if they don't meet her husband's standards.\n"
