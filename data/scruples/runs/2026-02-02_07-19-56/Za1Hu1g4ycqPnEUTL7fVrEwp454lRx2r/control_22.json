My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a woman in her early 30s who's been with her husband for seven years. Her weight has been a topic of debate in their relationship. She fluctuates between 140-154 lbs, which is the same weight she was when she met her husband. She used to be much heavier, around 220 lbs, but managed to lose 70 lbs. She had a period where she was very active and disciplined, getting down to 125 lbs, but that didn't last because of a demanding job. Now her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs and doesn't understand why it's hard for her. He's disciplined and thinks she's not trying hard enough, even calling her lazy. She acknowledges she could try harder but also thinks it's okay to be at her current weight without strict tracking.\n\nSo, is she the asshole? The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario.\n\nFirst, the husband's perspective: He wants her to reach his ideal weight, maybe for his own reasons, like how she looks. He's fit himself, so he might have high standards. But he doesn't seem to understand the emotional and physical challenges she faces. He's being critical and not supportive, which could be a problem. He's implying she's lazy, which is a harsh judgment.\n\nOn the author's side, she's admitted she's not trying as hard as she could. But she's also saying it's hard and emotional for her. She's in a demanding job, which might affect her ability to maintain strict discipline. She's at a weight she's been at since before the relationship. She's not harming anyone by staying at her current weight, assuming her health is okay. The fact that she's fluctuating between 140-154 lbs and that's where she's been for years suggests that maybe her current weight is a maintenance range for her. The husband's expectation might be unrealistic if her body naturally gravitates to that range despite efforts.\n\nHealth-wise, if her BMI is in the healthy range, then maybe there's no issue. Let's calculate BMI. She's 5'6\", which is about 66 inches. Her current weight is 140-154 lbs. Using the BMI formula (weight in pounds / (height in inches)^2 * 703), let's take 140 lb: 140 / (66^2) * 703 = 140/(4356)*703 \u2248 22.4. 154 lb would be 154/4356*703 \u2248 24.7. So her BMI is between 22-25, which is considered normal to overweight. Wait, 24.7 is still within the normal range (18.5-24.9), so 154 is just over that. So maybe the husband's target of 125 lb would be a BMI of around 19.8, which is normal. But that's a drastic loss from her current weight. However, if she's been maintaining 140-150 lbs for years, maybe it's her natural weight, and trying to go lower could be unhealthy or unsustainable.\n\nThe husband's criticism is that she's not trying hard enough. But weight management is complex, involving metabolism, lifestyle, stress, and mental health. Her job is demanding, which affects her time and energy. The author is in a tough spot because she's trying to balance work and health, and her husband's expectations might not consider these factors. He's also projecting his own discipline onto her, which isn't fair because everyone has different challenges and body types.\n\nThe author isn't necessarily the asshole here. She's aware she could try harder but also feels it's okay to accept her current state. The husband's lack of empathy and his harsh judgment (\"lazy\") might be the bigger issue. The key is whether the author's current weight is causing harm. If she's healthy and happy, then maybe the husband's push is unnecessary. However, if she's unhappy and wants to lose weight but is struggling, that's a different matter. The question is about her being in the wrong for not trying harder. Since she's not in a harmful situation and the husband is being critical without support, the answer might be \"No,\" the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more problematic here.\n"
