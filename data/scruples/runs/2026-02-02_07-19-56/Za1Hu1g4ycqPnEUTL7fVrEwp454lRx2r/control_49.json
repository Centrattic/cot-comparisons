My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband, who wants her to lose more weight. She's been struggling with her weight, has a history of losing a lot but fluctuating now. Her husband is very disciplined and sees her current weight as not being at her goal, while she feels it's okay to accept her current state without strict tracking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman has a history of significant weight loss, which is impressive. She's currently in a weight range that's been stable for her, and she's had a period of strict discipline but couldn't maintain it due to job demands. The husband's criticism is making her feel like she's not trying hard enough, and he's projecting his own disciplined approach onto her. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but also feels it's okay to be at her current weight.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. From a perspective of personal autonomy, each person has the right to decide their own body and lifestyle. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic or not considering her health and personal struggles. Weight management is complex and varies per individual. The woman's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could might suggest some self-awareness, but she's also balancing a demanding job. \n\nAnother angle: the husband's behavior. He's making her feel like she's lazy, which is potentially hurtful. Relationships require mutual respect, and his approach might be contributing to the problem. The fact that he's very fit and in the top 5% might mean he has different standards or doesn't understand her challenges. \n\nThe woman's point about accepting her current state could be a valid choice, especially if it's a healthy range for her. The AITA here hinges on whether not meeting someone else's expectations (her husband's) constitutes being in the wrong. Since body image and health are personal, and the husband's pressure is causing emotional distress, the woman isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing her own approach to her body. \n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. If the issue is that she's not making enough effort, but given her history and current circumstances, maybe she is making an effort but to a different standard. The husband's \"80% done\" perspective might be unrealistic. So, considering all that, the answer leans towards B (she's not in the wrong) because personal choices about body image and the effort put into weight management are subjective and influenced by individual circumstances. The husband's judgment and pressure are problematic, not necessarily her choice to not try harder in her own way.\n"
