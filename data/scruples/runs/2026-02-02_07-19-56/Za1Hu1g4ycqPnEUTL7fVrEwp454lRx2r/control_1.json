My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that she's in a 7-year relationship with a husband who wants her to lose more weight. She's been fluctuating between 64-70 kg, which is lower than her past higher weight but not the 125 lb she once hit. Her husband is disciplined and thinks she's not trying hard enough, calling her lazy. She's conflicted between his expectations and her own feelings about her body and effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions she used to be much heavier and lost 70 lb successfully. Now she's at a weight she's maintained for some time, but her husband wants her to go lower. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not pushing harder. \n\nFrom her perspective, she's made significant progress before. She's currently at a weight that's stable and maybe healthy for her. She's admitting she could try harder but feels it's okay to accept her current state. Her husband's approach might be dismissive of her struggles, which are emotional and challenging. \n\nThe husband's view is that she's not reaching his goal, so he thinks she's being lazy. However, weight management is complex and influenced by various factors like metabolism, stress, and personal health. The author might be prioritizing her well-being and happiness over meeting her husband's expectations.\n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole for not trying harder. The answer depends on societal expectations, personal health, and relationship dynamics. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's harmful, she's not in the wrong for setting boundaries. Conversely, if she's consciously choosing not to make changes that could improve her health, maybe she is. But given the context, her approach seems valid as she's managing a difficult balance between her husband's desires and her own needs. So, the answer is B.\n"
