My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about weight management in a relationship. The author is a woman who's been with her husband for seven years. She fluctuates between 64-70kg, which is around 140-154 lbs at 5'6\". She used to be heavier, about 220 lbs, and lost 70 lbs before, but now it's a struggle. She had a period where she was disciplined with diet and exercise, reaching 125 lbs, but that didn't last due to a demanding job. Her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs and is frustrated because she's not trying as hard. The husband is very fit and disciplined. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay as she is now.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The husband's perspective is that he wants her to achieve her previous weight, which he sees as a goal, and he doesn't understand the emotional difficulty. The author is struggling with weight management, which might have health implications, and feels that her husband isn't supportive. She's in a state of accepting her current weight versus the effort required. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's body, mutual understanding in a relationship, and the pressure to conform to certain standards. The author isn't in denial about her weight; she acknowledges she's not trying as hard but finds the current approach acceptable. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic if he's imposing his own standards without considering her struggles. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not trying harder? Weight management is complex and can be influenced by various factors like health, metabolism, stress, and lifestyle. The author has a history of significant weight loss, which shows capability, but maintaining it is hard. The husband's criticism might be contributing to her emotional distress, which can affect weight management negatively. \n\nHowever, the author also admits she's not trying as hard as she could. There's a balance between respecting personal choices and acknowledging the effort needed for health. If the author is choosing not to put in the effort despite knowing the challenges, some might see that as her being in the wrong. But if the husband isn't supportive and his expectations are unrealistic, that could shift the blame towards him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder. The answer depends on whether not trying harder is a valid choice given her circumstances. Since maintaining a healthy weight is important for her health and the husband's support seems lacking, the author might not be in the wrong. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic, and the author's decision to prioritize her current lifestyle over further weight loss could be her right. \n\nBut the author does acknowledge that she's not trying as hard as she could. So there's a degree of self-awareness. The decision to not try harder might be a personal choice based on what she deems acceptable for her life. The husband's pressure might be part of the problem, but the author is also making a choice. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, sometimes people are blamed for not meeting goals, but in this case, the author's struggle is real. The husband's lack of understanding could be a bigger issue. However, the author is choosing to accept her current state, which is her autonomy. Therefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
