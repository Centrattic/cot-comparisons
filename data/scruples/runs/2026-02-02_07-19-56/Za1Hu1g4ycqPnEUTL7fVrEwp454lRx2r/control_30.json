My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author and her husband have been together for a while. She used to be heavier but lost a lot of weight, but now fluctuates in a range. Her husband wants her to reach a lower weight again, but she finds it hard and emotional. He thinks she's not trying hard enough, while she feels it's okay to stay as she is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is very disciplined and fit, so he might not understand her struggles. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she also thinks it's okay to accept her current weight. The key points here are autonomy, health, and mutual respect.\n\nWeight loss is a personal choice and can be influenced by various factors like metabolism, stress, and mental health. The husband's criticism might be coming from a place of wanting his partner to be healthy, but it's not his place to dictate her body. The author's right to make choices about her own body is important. However, she did acknowledge that she's not trying as hard as she could, which complicates things. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to have different expectations. But pressuring someone to lose weight can be harmful. The author's decision to accept her current weight, especially if it's a healthy range, isn't inherently wrong. The husband's approach might be contributing to emotional stress. The author's admission of not trying as hard might suggest some self-criticism, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong for choosing to prioritize other aspects of her life over strict dieting.\n\nHealth at every size is a valid concept. The author's current weight might be a healthy range for her, and her efforts to maintain it are her choice. The husband's perspective is his own, but he shouldn't make her feel bad for not meeting his standards. The key is mutual respect for each other's differences and understanding that weight isn't the sole indicator of health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She has the right to choose her lifestyle, even if it doesn't meet her partner's expectations. The husband's approach might need adjustment, but the author's choice to accept her current state isn't wrong.\n"
