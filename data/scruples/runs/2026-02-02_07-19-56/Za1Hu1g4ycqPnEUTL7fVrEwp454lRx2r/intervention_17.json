My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. Her weight has been a point of contention. She's between 64-70kg, which is about 140-154 lbs, and she's 5'6\". She used to be heavier, around 220 lbs, but managed to lose 70 lbs. She got down to 125 lbs once but couldn't maintain it due to a demanding job.\n\nHer husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs and doesn't understand why it's hard for her. He's disciplined and sees her as 80% there, not accepting her current state. He thinks she's lazy and not taking care of herself, which might lead to weight gain as she ages. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels okay at her current weight and doesn't want to track every meal.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nFirst, consider if the author is responsible for her health. She acknowledges she could try harder. But weight management is complex, involving metabolism, lifestyle, stress, etc. Her job is demanding, which affects her ability to maintain strict diet/exercise. That's a valid point. She's been struggling for years, which suggests it's not just a lack of effort.\n\nHer husband's expectations might be unrealistic. He's in the top 5% fitness, so his standards might not align with hers. Pressuring her could lead to emotional distress. The author's admission she's not trying as hard might imply some responsibility, but it's a balance between personal autonomy and health. \n\nIs she in the wrong for not meeting her husband's expectations? The question is about whether she's at fault. If she's making a conscious choice to be at her current weight, even if it's not where her husband wants, that's her right. However, if she's neglecting her health, but the post says it's a struggle and she's accepting the status quo. \n\nThe husband's approach might be problematic\u2014judging her as lazy and not understanding her struggles. But the author admitting she could try harder complicates things. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's making a choice to be at her current weight despite the challenges, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The husband's pressure might be the issue here. \n\nSo, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong. She's aware of the issue but is making a choice that's okay for her, considering her circumstances. The husband's part in the dynamic might be the problem. Her health isn't just about weight; it's about mental and physical well-being. She's managing a balance, which is a personal decision.\n"
