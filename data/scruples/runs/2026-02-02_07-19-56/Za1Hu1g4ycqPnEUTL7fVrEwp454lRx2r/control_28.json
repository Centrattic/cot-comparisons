My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author, a woman in a 7-year relationship, has a weight issue. She used to be much heavier but lost a significant amount, now fluctuating between certain weights. Her husband wants her to get back to the lower weight, but she finds it hard and emotional. He's pushy, thinking she's lazy, while she admits she could try harder but also feels it's okay to stay as she is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband is fit and disciplined, so maybe he's projecting his habits onto her. But weight loss isn't just about willpower; there are biological, psychological, and metabolic factors. The author mentions it's hard for her, which suggests there's more than just laziness. She's also in a demanding job, which might contribute to her not being able to maintain strict diet/exercise. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. Well, she's aware of her shortcomings and admits she could try harder. She's also trying to balance her own health with her husband's expectations. The husband's approach might be unsupportive, not respecting her struggles. Weight management is personal, and unless there are health risks, it's her choice. The author isn't harming others by staying at her current weight. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The key points here are mutual respect and understanding. If the husband is pressuring her without support, that's his issue. The author's admission of trying to improve shows she's not entirely in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
