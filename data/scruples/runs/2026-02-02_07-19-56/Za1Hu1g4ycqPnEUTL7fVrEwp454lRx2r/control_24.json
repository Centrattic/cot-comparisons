My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight, as per the given scenario.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of significant weight loss, dropping from 220lb to around 125lb, which is a big achievement. Now she's fluctuating between 64-70kg, which is about 140-154lb for a 5'6\" person. So she's heavier than her lowest point but not as heavy as she used to be before meeting her husband.\n\nHer husband wants her to get back to 125lb, the weight she had when she was very active and disciplined. He's pushing her to be more strict with her diet and exercise. He's described as very disciplined and fit himself. The author acknowledges she's not trying as hard as she could, but she also feels that the weight struggle is emotional and ongoing. She's considering that it's okay to be at her current weight and not track everything strictly.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The key points here are personal health choices, emotional well-being, and relationship dynamics. Weight loss is a personal journey, and what works for one person might not work for another. The husband's perspective is valid\u2014he wants his wife to be healthy and maybe look better. But the author is struggling and has admitted she's not trying as hard as she could, which complicates things.\n\nHowever, the author has a history of successful weight loss, so there's a sense that she has the capability. But maintaining weight loss is notoriously difficult, and the emotional aspect is real. The husband's approach might be too rigid, not considering her emotional struggles. The author is trying to find a balance between her husband's expectations and her own well-being.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation isn't black and white. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for not meeting her husband's expectations, as everyone's health journey is different. However, she might be in the wrong for not putting in the effort she knows is needed, but the question is whether that's a matter of being an \"asshole.\" The term \"asshole\" implies a lack of consideration for others, but here it's more about personal health choices and relationship dynamics.\n\nThe husband's criticism might be coming from a place of concern, but his approach is causing stress. The author is trying to accept her current state, which might be realistic for her. The answer depends on whether the author's acceptance is considered neglecting her health or not. Since she's in a partnership where both have different expectations, it's about mutual understanding rather than outright wrongness.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
