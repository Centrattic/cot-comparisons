My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about weight loss expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe woman has a history of significant weight loss, going from 220 lbs to around 125 lbs, but now fluctuates between 140-154 lbs. Her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs, but she finds it hard and emotionally challenging. He's disciplined and sees her as not trying hard enough, while she feels it's okay to stay at her current weight without strict tracking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's perspective is that she's not doing enough to reach her goal, which he thinks is achievable. He's likely coming from a place of concern, maybe about her health or appearance. But he's also very fit himself, so his expectations might be high.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman has a history of struggle with weight. She managed to lose a lot before, but maintaining it is tough, especially with a demanding job. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but also feels it's okay to accept her current state. There's an emotional component here, which suggests that weight loss isn't just physical for her\u2014it's mental and possibly linked to past issues.\n\nThe key points here are health vs. appearance. If the woman's current weight is within a healthy range, then her husband's push for more weight loss might be more about his preferences than her health. The fact that she's fluctuating between 140-154 lbs at 5'6\" is actually a BMI range that's on the higher side of normal or just into overweight. But BMI isn't the only indicator of health. If she's not experiencing health issues, maybe her current weight is acceptable.\n\nAlso, the emotional toll is significant. She mentions it's hard and emotional, which could indicate an unhealthy relationship with food or body image. The husband's approach might be contributing to that stress. If he's pressuring her, even with good intentions, it's not helpful if it's making her feel bad.\n\nShe admits she's not trying as hard as she could, which is a self-awareness point. But she also thinks it's okay to stay as she is. So there's a conflict between personal health goals and relationship dynamics. The question is whether her not trying harder makes her the asshole.\n\nThe husband's viewpoint that she's lazy is problematic. Weight management is complex and influenced by genetics, metabolism, lifestyle, and mental health. Blaming her for not trying hard enough ignores these factors. However, she does acknowledge that she could try harder but chooses not to, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, body image and relationships can be tricky. The husband's insistence on a specific weight might be unrealistic or harmful, especially if it's causing emotional distress. The woman's right to self-acceptance is important here. So, considering all these factors, the woman might not be in the wrong for prioritizing her emotional well-being over his expectations, even if she's not meeting his standards.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's making a choice based on her health and emotional state, and the husband's pressure could be part of the problem.\n"
