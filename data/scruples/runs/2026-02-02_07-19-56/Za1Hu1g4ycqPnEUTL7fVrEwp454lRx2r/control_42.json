My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that she's in a long-term relationship with her husband, and he wants her to reach a lower weight. She used to be heavier but lost a lot before, then her weight fluctuates. She's at 64-70kg now, which is around 168cm tall. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lb, which she achieved before but couldn't maintain. He thinks she's lazy and not disciplined enough. She feels the pressure but isn't trying as hard as she could, but she's also okay with her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's perspective is that she's not doing enough, but he's very disciplined. She's trying to balance her own comfort and health with his expectations. The key points here are autonomy over one's body, the pressure from a partner, and the emotional aspect of weight struggles.\n\nWeight management is a personal journey and can be influenced by various factors like metabolism, stress, health conditions, etc. The husband's approach might be too rigid, not considering her emotional and physical challenges. The author isn't in denial about her weight; she acknowledges she could try harder but also feels it's acceptable to be where she is. That shows self-awareness and a balanced view, which is important. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. If someone is making a conscious choice to accept their current weight despite others' opinions, especially when they've tried before and struggled, it's their right. The husband's insistence on her reaching a previous goal might be unrealistic, especially if that weight isn't sustainable for her. Health isn't just about weight, and the pressure from a partner can be harmful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a choice based on her own circumstances and well-being. The husband's perspective might be valid in wanting her to be healthy, but it's not his place to dictate her body image unless there are health concerns. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
