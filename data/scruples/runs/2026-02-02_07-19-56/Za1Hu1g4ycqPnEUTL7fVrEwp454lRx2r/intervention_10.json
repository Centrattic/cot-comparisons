My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The author is in a long-term relationship where her husband wants her to reach a specific weight (125 lbs), which she previously achieved. She's currently between 140-154 lbs and feels it's hard to maintain. Her husband is disciplined and fit, which adds to the pressure.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her husband wants her to reach 125 lbs again. But her current weight is where she's been for a while, and she's struggling with it emotionally. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also okay with staying at her current weight. The key points here are about mutual respect and understanding in the relationship.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that he wants her to be healthier and look better for him, but he doesn't understand the emotional struggle. The author feels he's being critical and doesn't get the difficulty. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, weight can be a sensitive issue. However, the main issue here is the dynamic between the couple. The author is being honest about her struggle and her current acceptance of her weight. The husband's expectations might not consider her emotional and physical challenges. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not meeting her partner's expectations, especially if those expectations are unrealistic or not respectful of her health and well-being.\n\nThe concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) often hinges on whether someone's actions are respecting others' boundaries. Here, the author hasn't done anything harmful; she's expressing her feelings and current situation. The husband's demands might be the issue if they're pressuring her in a way that's unhealthy or disrespectful. The author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could shows self-awareness, but she's also prioritizing her own well-being and current contentment. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the situation is more about differing perspectives and the husband's expectations not matching the author's reality and health needs.\n"
