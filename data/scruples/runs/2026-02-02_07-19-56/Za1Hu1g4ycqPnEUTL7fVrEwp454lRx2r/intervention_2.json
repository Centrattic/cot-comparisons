My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. Her weight has been a point of contention. She's currently between 64-70kg, which is the same as when she met her husband. She used to be heavier but lost 70 pounds before, but her weight is hard to maintain. She had a period where she was very active and disciplined, reaching 125lb, but her demanding job made it hard to keep up. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lb, thinking she's not trying hard enough, calling her lazy. She acknowledges she could try harder but feels it's okay to accept her current state without strict tracking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's approach is disciplined and maybe he's projecting his own habits onto her. He wants her to reach a specific goal, but he's not understanding the emotional and physical challenges she's facing. On the other hand, the author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, which might imply she's aware she's not meeting her own expectations, but she also feels it's acceptable to stay where she is. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy over one's body, the role of the partner in health goals, and the emotional impact. The author might be in the right if she's making a choice that's healthy for her, even if it's not the same as her partner's. However, if she's not making effort at all and is being dismissive, maybe that's a problem. But she does mention she used to be more disciplined and admits she's not trying as hard, which suggests some self-awareness. \n\nThe husband's criticism about her being lazy and not taking care of herself could be hurtful, especially if he doesn't consider her struggles. Weight management isn't just about willpower; it can involve metabolism, stress, and other factors. The fact that she's had success before but can't maintain it now, possibly due to job demands, complicates things. \n\nThe author's stance is about accepting herself, which is valid, but the question is whether not trying harder is the wrong choice. If the husband is pressuring her and she's choosing to not make changes, it's a personal decision. However, the author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could might tip the scale towards her being in the wrong, but only if her current state is harmful. Since the husband is concerned about health, but the author isn't, it's a balance between his concerns and her autonomy.\n\nIn the end, the answer might hinge on whether the author's choice is healthy and respectful to herself and her partner. If she's making an informed choice to maintain her current weight despite her husband's wishes, she's not in the wrong. But if she's neglecting her health, maybe she is. The question is whether \"not trying harder\" is wrong. Since she's not causing harm to others and has a right to her body, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
