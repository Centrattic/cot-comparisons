My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. She's been fluctuating between 64-70 kg, which is the same as when she met him. She lost a significant amount of weight before, dropping from 220 to 125 lbs, but now she's struggling to maintain it. Her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs and doesn't understand why it's hard for her. He's disciplined and sees her as not trying hard enough, even calling her lazy. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay at her current weight, not tracking food meticulously.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's expectations might be influenced by his own fitness and discipline. He's in the top 5% for his age, so his health goals might be very important to him. However, he's projecting his standards onto his partner, which could be a problem. Weight management can be complex due to biological, psychological, and lifestyle factors. The author mentions it's emotional for her, indicating that there's more than just willpower involved.\n\nThe author hasn't said she's unwilling to try. She's acknowledging that she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also accepting her current state. The key here is autonomy in health decisions. While the husband wants her to reach a specific weight, the author has the right to make choices about her body. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If she's not causing harm to herself or others, maybe she's not wrong. But if she's being complacent despite knowing the risks, maybe there's a different angle.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's approach might be controlling or unsupportive. Criticizing her for not meeting his standards could be a form of emotional pressure. The author is in the middle, trying to balance his expectations with her own health and well-being.\n\nThe subreddit often looks at whether the action in question violates social norms or is harmful. Here, the author isn't harming anyone; she's choosing her lifestyle. The husband's pressure might be the issue, but the question is about the author. Since she's not forcing her weight on others and is aware of her choices, she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
