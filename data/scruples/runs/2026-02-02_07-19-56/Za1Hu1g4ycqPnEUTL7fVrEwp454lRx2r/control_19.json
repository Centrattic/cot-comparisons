My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a woman in a 7-year relationship. Her weight has been an ongoing issue. She used to be much heavier but lost 70 pounds, settling around 140-154 lbs (5'6\"). Her husband wants her to get back down to 125 lbs, which she achieved briefly but couldn't maintain due to a demanding job. He thinks she's lazy and not disciplined enough, while she feels it's hard and emotional for her. She's not trying as hard as she could but is okay with her current weight.\n\nSo, the core issue is about expectations and effort. The husband wants her to reach a specific weight, but she's struggling with it. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also in a tough spot with her job. Is she in the wrong for not meeting his expectations?\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the husband's demands are reasonable. He's very fit and disciplined, which is his personality. But weight loss is a personal journey with health and emotional aspects. The author mentions it's hard and emotional for her. There's a difference between wanting to lose weight for health and being pressured by a partner. \n\nThe author isn't refusing to try; she's not trying as hard as she could. However, she's also in a situation where her job is demanding, which might affect her ability to maintain strict diet and exercise. So, is she wrong for not meeting her husband's expectations? Or is the husband wrong for pressuring her?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have a choice in how much effort she wants to put in. But if she's not meeting her own goals, maybe she's in the wrong? But the question is about not trying harder. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, so maybe she is in the wrong. However, the context of her struggles (emotional, job stress) might mitigate that. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's approach is to not understand her difficulties and being critical. That could be his part of the problem. But the question is about the author's actions. She's choosing to accept her current weight, which she's been at for while, and not try as hard. If she's aware she could try harder but chooses not to, maybe she's in the wrong. However, if her efforts are being hindered by external factors (job, emotional issues), maybe not.\n\nThe AITA question hinges on societal expectations. Often, people are told they should try harder for their health, but relationships can complicate this. The author is conflicted, acknowledging she's not trying as hard but also feeling it's okay to stay as she is. If the question is about not trying harder in general, maybe she is in the wrong. If it's about not meeting her husband's expectations, then it's a relational issue but not necessarily her fault.\n\nBut the answer options are A for yes (author in wrong) and B for no. Considering she admits she's not trying as hard as she could, maybe A. But her challenges (job, emotional) might mean she's not in the wrong. The husband's lack of understanding is part of the problem. However, the question is about the author's actions. If she's aware she's not trying hard enough but chooses not to, maybe she's in the wrong. But if the problem is the husband's pressure, then maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the husband's expectations are unrealistic and not considering her struggles. The author is making a choice based on her own health and circumstances, and the husband is not supporting her. However, she does admit she's not trying as hard as she could. But in AITA contexts, sometimes the person is not in the wrong if they're dealing with health issues. Maybe B is the right answer.\n"
