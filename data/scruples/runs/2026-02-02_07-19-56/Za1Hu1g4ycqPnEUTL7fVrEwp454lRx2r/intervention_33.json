My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about weight loss and a partner's expectations.\n\nFirst, the author is a 32-year-old woman in a 7-year relationship. She's been fluctuating between 64-70 kg, which is around the weight she was when she met her husband. She used to be much heavier (220 lbs) but lost 70 lbs, then dropped to 125 lbs but couldn't maintain it. Now her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs, but she finds it hard and emotional. He's disciplined and doesn't understand her struggles. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels okay with her current weight.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is wrong for not trying harder. The author is being honest about her struggles. Weight loss can be really hard, and she's managed to lose a lot before. But she's not maintaining it. Her husband is pushing for more, but she's not meeting those expectations. However, she's aware that she could try harder but chooses to accept her current state.\n\nIn AITA contexts, people often consider both parties' perspectives. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic if he's not considering her difficulties. The author isn't being lazy on purpose but finds it hard. On the other hand, she's not making an effort to meet her husband's desires. But is it her fault? It's a complex issue. The husband's approach might be part of the problem too. The author is being honest about her challenges, so maybe she's not in the wrong. Or maybe she's not trying enough, so she is at fault. It's tricky. The key is whether her not trying harder is her fault. If she's aware and still not putting in effort, maybe A. But if her struggles are valid and the husband isn't supportive, maybe B. The author states she's not trying as hard as she could, which implies she could do better. So maybe the answer is A. But also, the husband's approach is part of the problem. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. Since she's the one not trying harder, perhaps A is correct.\n"
