My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a woman in a 7-year relationship) is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight, as per her husband's expectations.\n\nFirst, the author's weight history is mentioned. She used to be much heavier but managed to lose a significant amount. Now she's fluctuating between 64-70kg, which is a weight she had when she met her husband. Her husband wants her to get back down to 125lb, which she achieved before but couldn't maintain. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but also feels it's okay to stay at her current weight.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the emotional aspect. The husband is pushing for her to reach a specific weight, which she found challenging before. The author is struggling with the emotional impact of this push and the difficulty in maintaining a strict regimen. She's also in a job that's very demanding, which might contribute to her current situation.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the husband is very disciplined and fit, which might lead to different expectations. However, the author is not in a harmful situation health-wise; her weight isn't stated as a medical issue. The main conflict is about personal choice and self-perception versus the husband's desires.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not meeting his expectations. From an external perspective, personal autonomy in body image is a significant factor. Unless there's a health risk, it's about personal choice. The author isn't refusing to try entirely but is questioning her own efforts. However, she's also considering her husband's perspective, which shows some awareness.\n\nThe husband's criticism that she's lazy and not taking care of herself might be hurtful, but the author's own admission of not trying as hard complicates things. But the core issue is whether her choice to stay at her current weight, given her history and challenges, makes her the \"asshole.\"\n\nIn such cases, societal views might lean towards supporting personal choice unless there's harm. The author's situation doesn't present health issues, so her decision to accept her current weight, despite her husband's wishes, isn't necessarily wrong. The husband's insistence might be more about his preferences than her well-being. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not the asshole).\n"
