My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in a long-term relationship with her husband. She's been struggling with her weight for years, and there's been ongoing tension about it. She used to be much heavier but managed to lose a significant amount and has fluctuated since then. Her current weight is between 140-154 lbs, which is where she was when she met her husband. She had a period where she was very active and disciplined, reaching 125 lbs, but that didn't last due to a demanding job. Now, her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs, but she finds it hard and emotional. He doesn't understand her struggle, thinks she's not trying hard enough, and is critical. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels okay staying as she is.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The user initially thinks she is, but the answer might require more nuance. \n\nWeight loss can be influenced by various factors beyond willpower, like metabolism, stress, job demands, and emotional issues. The author mentions it's hard for her to keep the weight down and that it's emotional. Her husband's approach seems to be judgmental, not supportive. He's comparing his discipline to hers, which might not be fair. Also, he's in the top 5% for fitness, so his expectations might be unrealistic for her. The author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could suggests some self-awareness, but the pressure to meet his standards might be unhealthy. The key here is whether not trying harder is her fault or if the husband's expectations are unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. However, health is a personal choice, and the husband's insistence might be intrusive. The author might have the right to her current weight if it's healthy, regardless of his preferences. So, maybe she's not in the wrong for not meeting his specific goal. The real issue might be their communication and mutual understanding. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as weight is complex and the husband's expectations could be the problem.\n"
