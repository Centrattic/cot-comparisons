My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author's husband wants her to reach a lower weight, which she previously achieved, but she finds it hard and emotional. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but also feels it's okay to be at her current weight. The husband is disciplined and fit.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are the author's admission that she's not trying as hard as she could. That suggests some responsibility on her part. However, weight management can be complex and influenced by various factors like genetics, metabolism, stress, and job demands. The user mentions a demanding job affecting her maintenance. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that he wants her to reach a lower weight, possibly for his own reasons, like appearance, but she feels the pressure is unwarranted. The author is struggling with emotional aspects, which indicates that this isn't just about laziness. The fact that she lost 70 pounds before shows she has the capability, but maintaining that is hard.\n\nThe husband's approach is critical, not understanding her struggles. That might not be his fault, but it affects her. However, the author's own admission of not giving her best effort could imply some wrongdoing. But societal views on weight and personal health choices vary. It's a balance between personal responsibility and the husband's expectations. \n\nThe answer isn't black and white. The author isn't the asshole for choosing a different lifestyle, but she might be neglecting her health if her weight is indeed causing issues. However, since the husband's concern is about her looking better for him, it might be more about his preferences than her health. The author's right to choose her lifestyle is important. \n\nConsidering all angles, while the author could be more proactive, the husband's lack of support and understanding complicates things. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not harming others and has a valid struggle, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. But her admission of not trying as hard complicates it. The key is that weight is personal, and the husband's pressure isn't justified. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
