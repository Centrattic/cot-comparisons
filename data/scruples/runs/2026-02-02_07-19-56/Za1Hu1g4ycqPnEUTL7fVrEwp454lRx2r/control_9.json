My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband, and they've had ongoing discussions about her weight. She's been between 64-70 kg, which she says is similar to when they met. She used to be much heavier but lost a significant amount, reaching 125 lb at one point, but that was before a demanding job. Now her husband wants her to get back to 125 lb, but she finds it hard and emotional. He's disciplined and doesn't understand her struggles, thinking she's lazy. She's questioning if she's wrong for not trying harder and accepting her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points are about personal autonomy, health, and relationship dynamics. The husband's expectations might be influenced by his own fitness standards, but does that make the author wrong for not meeting them? Weight loss is a personal choice and can be influenced by various factors like genetics, health, and lifestyle. The author mentions that her weight is a constant struggle, which suggests it's not just a matter of trying harder. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's disrespectful or inconsiderate of her efforts and challenges, that's his issue, not hers. The author is also acknowledging that she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's okay with her current status. That seems like a personal decision, which is valid. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
