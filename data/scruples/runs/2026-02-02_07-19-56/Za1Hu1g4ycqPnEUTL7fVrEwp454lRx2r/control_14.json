My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is a 32-year-old woman in a 7-year relationship. She's been fluctuating between 64-70 kg (140-154 lbs) for a while. She used to be much heavier, like 220 lbs, but managed to lose 70 lbs before meeting her husband. She had a short period where she was very disciplined, working out a lot and eating carefully, which brought her down to 125 lbs, but then a demanding job made it hard to maintain. Now her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs. He's disciplined and doesn't understand why it's so hard for her. He thinks she's lazy and not taking care of herself, and that she'll get fatter as she ages. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also okay with where she is now and doesn't want to track everything she eats. The question is whether she's the asshole for not trying harder and accepting her current weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband wants her to try harder to reach a lower weight, while the author feels it's hard for her and is okay with her current state. The key points are the struggle with weight, the husband's expectations, and the author's self-perception.\n\nThe author mentions that her weight has been a debate in the relationship. The husband's perspective is that she's not at her goal weight (125 lbs) and that she's not trying enough. He's disciplined himself, so he may not fully grasp the difficulty she has in maintaining weight loss. The author, on the other hand, acknowledges that she could try harder but also feels that it's acceptable to be at her current weight. She's dealing with emotional issues around weight and has had success before, but life circumstances (like her job) have affected her ability to maintain it.\n\nNow, from a health standpoint, the author's weight might not be considered unhealthy. 64-70 kg for someone who is 168 cm tall (which is 5'6\") would place her BMI around 21-23, which is in the healthy range. So there's no medical urgency here. The issue seems to be more about the husband's expectations and the author's own motivations.\n\nThe husband's criticism that she's lazy and not taking care of herself could be seen as invalidating her struggles. Weight management is complex and not just about willpower; it involves metabolism, stress, life circumstances, and emotional factors. The author has had success before, which shows she's capable, but maintaining it is hard. The husband's approach might be contributing to the emotional difficulty she's experiencing.\n\nThe author isn't in denial; she admits she's not trying as hard as she could. However, she's also content with her current weight and doesn't want to live a highly disciplined lifestyle. This raises the question of whether she's obligated to meet her husband's expectations when it's not harmful to her health. The husband's concern about her looking better for him is a personal preference, not a health issue. \n\nThe husband's own fitness level (top 5% in his age group) might influence his perspective, but that doesn't mean his expectations are fair. Everyone has different body types and challenges. The fact that he's very fit doesn't necessarily mean he understands the author's specific struggles.\n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" question, the author isn't forcing her husband to stay in the relationship or being dismissive of his feelings. She's acknowledging that her husband's perspective is valid (that weight matters) but also standing by her own boundaries. The husband's criticism of her as lazy and not taking care of herself could be seen as more harmful, as it's a judgment on her character rather than her health.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for not trying harder to meet a goal that isn't necessarily necessary for her health and is more about her husband's preferences. She's aware of her own capacity and has her own reasons for being content with her current weight. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic given her history and current circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
