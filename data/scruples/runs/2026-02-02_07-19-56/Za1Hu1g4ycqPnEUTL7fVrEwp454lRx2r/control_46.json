My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether they should be trying harder to lose weight as per their husband's wishes. \n\nFirst, the author's weight has been an ongoing issue in the relationship. She mentions she used to be much heavier but managed to lose 70 pounds. Now she fluctuates between 140-154 lbs, which is the same as when she met her husband. She tried a strict regimen to get down to 125 lbs, but that didn't last due to a demanding job. \n\nHer husband wants her to reach 125 lbs again, not understanding the difficulty. He's disciplined and thinks she's lazy. The author admits she could try harder but feels it's acceptable to stay as she is without strict tracking.\n\nThe key points here are about personal autonomy and mutual understanding. The author's health and self-worth shouldn't be dictated by her husband's preferences. While she admits she could try harder, that doesn't mean she's in the wrong for choosing her current lifestyle. The husband's push for a specific weight might be invalidating her struggles. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's in the same weight range as when they met suggests that her current weight isn't a new issue caused by her relationship. The husband's fitness level doesn't negate the author's right to her own body standards. \n\nSo, considering these aspects, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem lies more in the husband's expectations and lack of empathy. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
