My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The author's husband wants her to reach a lower weight, but she's struggling and feels that her husband doesn't understand the emotional difficulty. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but thinks it's okay to stay at her current weight. The husband is very disciplined and fit, which adds to the pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that she's been in a relationship for a long time, has fluctuated in weight, and has had success before but finds it hard now. She's in a demanding job and feels emotional about the weight issue. Her husband, on the other hand, is pushing her to reach a specific goal, maybe for her own health or his preferences, but he's not getting the support she needs from him. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual understanding and respect. The author feels her husband doesn't understand her struggles, and he might be being unsupportive by labeling her as lazy. She's in a tough spot because she knows she could try harder but also feels entitled to a balanced approach. The question is whether her decision to maintain her current weight without strict measures makes her the asshole.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She acknowledges her husband's perspective but also her own challenges. The real issue might be communication between the two. If her husband is pressuring her without support, that's problematic. However, the author could work on finding a middle ground where she can improve her health without the intense pressure. The answer might depend on whether the author is making healthy choices that respect her well-being, even if they don't meet her husband's expectations. Since she's not causing harm beyond herself, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she's ignoring health issues, that could be different. The post doesn't mention health problems, just her husband's desire for her to look better. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
