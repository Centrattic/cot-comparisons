My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight.\n\nFirst, the situation: the woman has a history of being heavier (220 lb) but lost 70 lbs and is now between 140-154 lbs (5'6\"). She had a phase where she was disciplined with exercise and diet, reaching 125 lb, but her job got demanding. Now her husband wants her back to 125 lb and thinks she's lazy. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but also feels it's okay to stay where she is.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, the user wants to know if the author is the asshole here. The husband's perspective is that he's being disciplined and wants her to reach the previous goal. But the author is struggling with emotional and possibly physical challenges. She mentions it's hard for her to maintain weight, and she's in a demanding job. \n\nWeight loss isn't just about willpower. There are biological factors, stress, metabolism, etc. The husband's approach seems to be one of high discipline, but maybe he's not considering her individual challenges. The author isn't denying she could try harder, but she also thinks it's okay to accept her current state. \n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework usually looks at intent and harm. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's harmful, maybe. But the author isn't necessarily refusing to try at all\u2014she's just not as strict as her husband wants. \n\nIs she in the wrong for not meeting his expectations? Or is the husband in the wrong for not respecting her effort and her body's reality? The author says she's admitted she's not trying as hard, but also that her current weight is manageable and she's not unhealthy. \n\nIf she's not harming anyone by staying at her current weight, maybe she's not in the wrong for choosing her health and happiness over his expectations. The husband's insistence might be more about his preferences rather than her health. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's making a choice about her body, and her husband's pressure isn't right to override that unless there's a health concern. Since she's not harming others, she's not the asshole here.\n"
