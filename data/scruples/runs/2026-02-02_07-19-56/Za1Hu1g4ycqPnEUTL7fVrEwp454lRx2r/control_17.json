My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. Her weight has been a topic of discussion. She's between 64-70kg and 168cm tall, which translates to around 140-154lb for 5'6\". She mentions she used to be much heavier (220lb) before meeting her husband and has managed to lose 70lb and keep it off. She had a phase where she was very active and disciplined, reaching 125lb, but her job became demanding and she lost that progress. Now her husband wants her to go back to 125lb, but she finds it hard and emotional. He doesn't understand the struggle, thinks she's not trying hard enough, and calls her lazy. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels okay with her current weight. The husband is very fit, top 5% in his age group.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. So, the key points here: the author's right to set her own health and lifestyle goals, the husband's expectations versus her own, and whether not meeting those expectations makes her the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of significant weight loss. She's maintained a healthier weight than before, even if not at her lowest. Her current weight is in a range that is considered normal for her height. The husband's desire for her to reach 125lb again might be unrealistic, especially since she's already lost a lot and it's a struggle. He seems to have a very disciplined approach and expects her to follow the same, but she's not in the same situation anymore due to a demanding job. She's also admitted she's not trying as hard as she could, but that's her choice. It's her body and her health. The husband's criticism might be projecting his own standards onto her. Weight loss isn't just about willpower; it can have emotional and physiological factors. The author's acceptance of her current state, as long as it's healthy, might be valid. The husband's push for more weight loss could be more about his preferences than her health. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to push harder if she's in a healthy range and the pressure is coming from someone else's expectations. The answer is B.\n"
