My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The situation is that the author's husband wants her to reach a specific weight (125lb) that she achieved before but hasn't maintained. The author is currently between 140-154lb, which she says is the same as when they met. She mentions that she used to be much heavier but lost 70lb, but now it's a struggle, and she's not as strict with her diet and exercise as she was before. Her husband is fit and disciplined, which might influence his expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he wants her to achieve a lower weight, seeing it as 80% done, and he's pushing for 100%. He might feel that she's not making enough effort, possibly affecting their relationship. The author, on the other hand, is struggling with maintaining weight due to a demanding job and emotional issues. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to accept her current state.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal autonomy, health, and relationship dynamics. Weight management is a personal choice, and while the husband has his preferences, the author's health and well-being should be her own priority. The author isn't harming anyone by staying at her current weight, and her struggle with weight maintenance is valid. However, she acknowledges that she could try harder but feels content now. The husband's criticism might be based on his own standards, not necessarily the author's best interest. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If \"wrong\" here means being lazy or not taking care of herself, then it's subjective. But from a health and personal choice standpoint, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing to accept her current weight. However, if the question is about not meeting her husband's expectations, then it's a matter of whether those expectations are reasonable. The husband's approach might be contributing to a toxic dynamic if he's pressuring her without considering her challenges.\n\nThe author mentions that her husband doesn't understand the emotional and practical difficulties, which suggests there's a communication issue. The author's admission of not trying as hard might indicate some self-criticism, but it's her right to decide how much effort she wants to put into weight management. So, considering all this, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because personal health goals shouldn't be dictated by a partner's expectations unless there's a health risk. The author's current situation seems to be a personal choice within a healthy range, and the husband's pressure might be the real issue here.\n"
