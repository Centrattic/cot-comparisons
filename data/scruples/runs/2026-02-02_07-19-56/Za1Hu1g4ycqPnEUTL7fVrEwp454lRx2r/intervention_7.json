My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether she's at fault for not trying harder to lose weight as her husband wants.\n\nFirst, the user provides context: she's been in a relationship for seven years, her weight has been an ongoing issue. She used to be much heavier, lost 70 pounds, but now fluctuates between 140-154lb. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lb. She says she understands his perspective but feels it's hard for her, and she's not trying as hard as she could. She's conflicted between wanting to meet his expectations and being okay with her current state. The husband is very fit and disciplined, which probably influences his viewpoint.\n\nSo, the key points here are about mutual expectations in a relationship regarding body image. The husband wants her to lose more weight, thinks she's not trying hard enough, and accuses her of being lazy. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to stay where she is. \n\nNow, societal norms might make people think that if someone is in a relationship with a very fit person, they should try to match that. But from a psychological standpoint, weight management is complex and can be influenced by metabolism, stress, genetics, etc. The author mentions that her job is demanding, which might affect her ability to maintain a strict regimen. Also, the emotional aspect is important\u2014she says it's emotional for her, which suggests there's more than just laziness involved.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that she's not doing enough, but he might not consider the difficulties she faces. His approach is rigid, thinking she's at 80% and needs to reach 100%, which might not be realistic or healthy for her. The author is honest about her struggles, so she's not necessarily being lazy; maybe it's a matter of different priorities or health considerations.\n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, it's about respect and understanding each other's perspectives. The husband's criticism might be harmful if it's making her feel bad about herself. The author, while not trying as hard as the husband wants, is honest about her challenges, so she might not be in the wrong here. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the husband's demands are unreasonable and if the author is being honest about her efforts. If the author is making an effort but it's not enough from the husband's perspective, she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, if she's not making any effort and just accepting the status quo, maybe she is. But she admits she's not trying as hard as she could, which suggests a middle ground. The question is whether her current efforts are sufficient given her personal circumstances. Since she's aware of the issue and trying to balance it with her job and health, perhaps she's not in the wrong. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any other angle I'm missing.\n"
