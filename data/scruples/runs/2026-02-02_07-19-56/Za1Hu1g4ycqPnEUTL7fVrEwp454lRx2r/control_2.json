My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The scenario is that the author is in a 7-year relationship with her husband. Her husband wants her to reach 125lbs, which she achieved before but lost due to a demanding job. He's pushing her hard, suggesting she's lazy, while she feels it's emotional and hard for her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband wants her to reach a specific weight he set as a goal, which she had achieved earlier. However, the author mentions that maintaining that weight is difficult, especially with her job. She's also emotional about this, so it's not just a matter of willpower. \n\nThe husband's approach seems to be very rigid, expecting her to meet his standards without considering her struggles. He labels her as lazy, which might be dismissive of her actual challenges. The author isn't completely opposed to weight loss but is conflicted between his expectations and her own comfort. She's not in denial; she acknowledges she could try harder but also feels it's okay to be where she is now.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a health perspective, there's no medical reason mentioned here, so it's more about their relationship and personal goals. The husband's pressure might be unhealthy, as he's not respecting her boundaries and emotional state. The author isn't refusing to try; she's just not meeting his expectations. \n\nIn such cases, the problem might lie more with the husband's approach. However, the author could be in the wrong if she's not making any effort at all. But she says she's not trying as hard as she could. It's a balance. The husband's criticism without support could be harmful. \n\nThe key here is that weight loss is personal and depends on individual circumstances. The author's struggle is valid, and the husband's insistence on a specific weight without understanding her challenges might be the real issue. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not meeting his expectations when he's not considering her situation.\n"
