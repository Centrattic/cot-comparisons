My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is a woman in a 7-year relationship. Her weight has been a topic of discussion. She was much heavier before meeting her husband, lost 70 pounds, but now fluctuates between 64-70kg (140-154lbs). She had a phase where she was down to 125lbs but her job became demanding. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lbs and thinks she's not trying hard enough. He's disciplined and doesn't understand her struggles. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's okay with her current weight. The question is whether she's the asshole for not trying harder.\n\nFirst, weight loss is a personal journey. The author has a history of significant weight loss, which shows she's capable. However, maintaining weight is different from losing it. She mentions it's a constant struggle and emotional for her. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic if he's comparing her current situation to her past success without considering her current circumstances (like a demanding job).\n\nThe husband's approach seems to be that since she's 80% there, she should push to 100%. But he's not considering the emotional and physical challenges she faces now. The author is conflicted between her husband's wishes and her own comfort. She's not in denial about her weight but feels it's okay to accept her current state. \n\nIs she wrong for not trying harder? Well, she's acknowledging her own shortcomings but feels she's in a sustainable place. Weight management isn't just about trying harder; it's about sustainability, mental health, and individual differences. If she's maintaining her health and happiness, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if her husband's concerns are valid (like health risks), that's another angle. However, the question is about being the asshole, which often relates to interpersonal dynamics rather than health.\n\nThe husband's criticism might be the main issue here. He's pressuring her, calling her lazy, which can be harmful. The author's acceptance of her current weight could be a reasonable choice for her well-being. So, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
