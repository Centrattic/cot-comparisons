My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight as per her husband's wishes. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 32-year-old woman in a 7-year relationship. She's been fluctuating between 64-70 kg, which is her current weight. She used to be much heavier, 220 lbs, but lost 70 lbs before meeting her husband. She reached 125 lbs through exercise and discipline but that didn't last due to a demanding job. Now her husband wants her to get back to 125 lbs, but she finds it hard and emotional. He thinks she's lazy and not trying, while she admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels okay staying at her current weight. The husband is very fit, in the top 5% for his age.\n\nSo the main conflict is between her husband's expectations and her own feelings about her body and effort. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder.\n\nI need to consider different angles. Weight loss can be a sensitive topic. The author has a history of significant weight loss, which shows she's capable. However, maintaining weight is challenging, especially with a stressful job. Her husband's criticism might be contributing to her stress. She acknowledges she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's comfortable now. \n\nFrom a health perspective, her current weight might be within a healthy range for her height (5'6\"). The husband's focus on reaching a specific number might be more about his preferences than her health. The author's emotional struggle suggests that this isn't just about effort; there's a psychological component. \n\nIs she obligated to meet her husband's expectations? Relationships require compromise, but there's a line. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that affects her mental health, that's a problem. The author's admission that she's not trying as hard implies some responsibility, but it's also about mutual respect. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's desire for her to be healthier (if that's the case) isn't entirely invalid. But the approach here seems more about his standards than her well-being. The key is whether the author is wrong for setting boundaries around her body and effort. \n\nIn many cases, people's bodies don't work the same way, and weight loss isn't just about willpower. The author might be realistic about her challenges. The husband's lack of understanding could be the bigger issue, but the question is about the author's actions. She's not refusing to try entirely; she's just not pushing as hard. That might not make her the asshole if she's prioritizing her well-being. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong for choosing her comfort and acknowledging her limitations, especially when the husband's expectations are not health-focused and are causing emotional distress.\n"
