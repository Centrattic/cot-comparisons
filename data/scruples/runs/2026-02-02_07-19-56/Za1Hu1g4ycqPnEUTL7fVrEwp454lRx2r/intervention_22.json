My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight, based on their situation. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that their weight has been an ongoing issue in the relationship. They've fluctuated between 64-70kg (140-154lb) since meeting their husband. They used to be much heavier (220lb) and managed to lose 70lb, reaching 125lb at one point when they were very disciplined with exercise and diet. However, due to a demanding job, they couldn't maintain that. Now, the husband wants them to get back to 125lb, but the author finds it hard and emotional. The husband views them as lazy, not taking proper care, and risks getting fatter. The author acknowledges they aren't trying as hard as they could but also thinks it's okay to stay as they are without strict tracking.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for not trying harder. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he's very disciplined and fit, so he might not fully understand the author's struggles. He wants her to meet his expectations, which could be for her to look better for him. However, weight loss is a personal journey with physical and emotional challenges. The author's history of significant weight loss and regain, along with a demanding job, suggests that maintaining weight is difficult. The fact that the author is self-aware enough to admit they aren't trying as hard but also feel it's acceptable to be where they are now is important. \n\nThe husband's criticism that she's lazy and not taking care of herself might not consider the author's emotional and practical difficulties. The author's weight fluctuation and past success indicate that it's not a simple matter of willpower. Also, the husband's perspective may not account for the author's personal health goals versus his own. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The author isn't refusing to try entirely; they acknowledge they could try harder but also value their current state. The husband's expectations might be unrealistic, not respecting the author's personal boundaries and challenges. The author's right to prioritize their well-being and comfort, given their history, should be considered. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the husband's demands are respecting the author's autonomy. If the author is making a conscious choice to maintain their current lifestyle despite the husband's preferences, it's not necessarily wrong. The husband's insistence without empathy could be the issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not meeting his expectations, especially given their history and stated challenges.\n"
