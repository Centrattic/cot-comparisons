My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about weight loss and a relationship issue. The author is a woman in her 30s who's been with her husband for seven years. She's been struggling with her weight, fluctuating between 64-70kg. She used to be much heavier and managed to lose a significant amount, but keeping it off is hard. Her husband wants her to reach a lower weight again, 125lb, and doesn't understand her struggles, thinking she's not trying hard enough. He's disciplined and fit himself, and she admits she's not trying as hard as she could. She's conflicted between wanting to meet his expectations and being okay with her current state.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points are her husband's expectations versus her own health and well-being. Weight loss is a personal journey, and it's not just about willpower. There are medical, emotional, and psychological factors involved. The husband's approach seems to be judgmental and not supportive, which isn't healthy. The author is self-aware, acknowledging her lack of effort but also her emotional connection to the issue. She mentions that maintaining weight is hard, especially with a demanding job, which affects her ability to stay disciplined.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. The answer hinges on whether her choice to accept her current weight is valid. If she's making a conscious decision to prioritize her well-being over her husband's expectations, that's her right. However, if she's aware that she could do more and is choosing not to, that might be seen as not taking responsibility. But from the context, she's admitted she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also not in a harmful situation. Her weight isn't affecting her health negatively, as far as we know. The husband's pressure could be the real issue here.\n\nIn terms of societal views, there's a trend towards body positivity and understanding that weight isn't just about effort. Medical conditions, metabolism, stress, and other factors play roles. The husband's belief that she's lazy doesn't consider these aspects. The author isn't harming anyone by staying at her current weight, so it's her choice. The real problem might be the husband's lack of support and judgment. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal choice, even if she could try harder, but it's her body and her life. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
