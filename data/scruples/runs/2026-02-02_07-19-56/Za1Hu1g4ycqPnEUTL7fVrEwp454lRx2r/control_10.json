My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. The author's husband wants her to reach a specific weight, which was her lowest point, but she finds it hard. The husband thinks she's lazy, while she acknowledges she's not trying as hard as she could but is okay with her current weight. \n\nFirst, the author mentions she used to be much heavier and succeeded in losing 70lbs. That's a significant achievement. Now she's fluctuating between 140-154lbs, and her husband wants her back to 125lbs. She tried a phase of strict diet and exercise but couldn't maintain it due to a demanding job. She's now in a state where she's not tracking everything she eats and isn't as disciplined.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author is not in the wrong if she's making a choice about her body. Weight is a personal matter, and while the husband might have his preferences, he can't dictate her health decisions. The husband's criticism of her as lazy might be invalid, given her past efforts and the fact that she's now choosing a different approach. \n\nAlso, the author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she's content with her current state. That's her right. The husband's perspective is that he's disciplined, but that doesn't mean others have to follow the same path. Everyone's body and lifestyle are different. \n\nThe husband's concern about her health might be valid, but how to address it is crucial. Pressuring someone with emotional comments or making them feel like they're the problem can be harmful. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and comfort, even if it's not meeting someone else's expectations. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
