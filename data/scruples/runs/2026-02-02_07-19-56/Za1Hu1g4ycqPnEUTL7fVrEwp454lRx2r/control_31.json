My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight. \n\nFirst, the author is a woman in a 7-year relationship with her husband. She's been struggling with her weight for a long time, having lost a significant amount before (from 220lb to around 125lb). Now she's in a range of 64-70kg (which is around 140-154lb) and her husband wants her to get back to 125lb. \n\nThe husband is very disciplined and fit, and he doesn't understand why it's hard for her. He thinks she's being lazy and not taking care of herself. The author admits she's not trying as hard as she could, but she also feels it's okay to stay at her current weight and not track everything.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's health vs. her husband's desires, the pressure to maintain a certain weight, and the emotional aspect of her struggle. The husband's perspective is that he wants her to reach a specific goal, but he's not considering the difficulty she's facing. The author is conflicted between trying harder and accepting her current state.\n\nFrom a health standpoint, BMI calculations might help. Let's see, 64kg at 168cm is a BMI of around 22.7, which is healthy. 70kg would be around 24.9, still within the normal range. 125lb (56.7kg) would be a BMI of 19.8, which is also healthy. So, she's already in a healthy range. Her husband's goal is within a healthy range but lower. However, the author mentions that this weight is a constant struggle, indicating possible disordered eating or emotional issues related to weight.\n\nThe husband's approach is to push her to reach a specific goal without understanding her emotional and physical challenges. The author feels pressured and possibly shamed for not meeting his expectations. She's trying to balance her own well-being against his desires. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not trying harder. But considering that she's already in a healthy weight range and the husband is pressuring her to meet his own standards, it might be his approach that's problematic. The author is trying to accept her current state, which is reasonable if she's healthy. The husband's insistence on a lower weight without empathy could be the issue here. \n\nAlso, she mentions that she's not trying as hard as she could, but maybe she's trying enough for herself. It's important to consider personal health goals over a partner's expectations unless there are medical reasons. Since there's no mention of health issues, the husband's focus on her weight might be more about his own preferences. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem might lie in the husband's lack of support and understanding.\n"
