My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about weight loss and the husband's expectations versus the author's feelings.\n\nFirst, the author is a woman in her 30s, in a long-term relationship. She mentions she used to be much heavier but lost a significant amount, then fluctuates between 64-70kg now. Her husband wants her to get back to 125lb, which she previously achieved. He's disciplined and thinks she's not trying hard enough, calling her lazy. She admits she's not trying as hard as she could but feels it's okay to be where she is now.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are autonomy, health, and mutual respect. The husband's desire for her to lose weight is based on his perspective, but the author has a history of weight struggles and it's emotional for her. She's not meeting his expectations but is content with her current state. \n\nFrom a personal autonomy standpoint, the author has the right to choose her lifestyle. Even if she's not as healthy as she could be, unless it's affecting their relationship negatively, it might not be her fault. However, she admits she could try harder. But the husband's approach might be dismissive of her struggles, which is important. \n\nThe question is whether not meeting the husband's expectations makes her the asshole. If the husband is pressuring her in a way that's unsupportive, that's his issue. The author's choice to accept her current state isn't necessarily wrong unless it's harming others. Since the husband is concerned about appearance and health, but the author is managing her own life, the answer might hinge on mutual respect. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if she's making a choice that's right for her life. The husband's lack of understanding and judgment could be his fault. So, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
