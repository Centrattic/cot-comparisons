My weight has been an ongoing debate in our relationship - I fluctuate between 64-70kg (168cm tall), for you Americans that's 140-154lb (5 ft 6\"). That is also the weight I had when I met my husband.\n\nA little background: I used to be A LOT heavier (top weight 220lb), but that was before I even met my husband. I managed to lose those around 70lb for good, but my weight is a constant struggle in my life and it's hard for me too keep it down. I had a short phase when I did lots of sports and was very disciplined about what I ate. During that time, I got down to 125lb, but that unfortunately didn't last long when I took up a very demanding job...\n\nMy husband wants me to get down to 125lb again, and doesn't understand why it's so hard and emotional for me. He figures I am at \"80% of goal reached\" and thinks I am not finished until I am at 100% (he is very disciplined about everything he does). He thinks I'm just lazy and don't take proper care of myself and will eventually get fatter and fatter as I age. I understand his perspective that I could look better for him (I don't pretend that weight doesn't matter at all), and I also admit that I am not trying as hard as I could. However, I also think it's ok to stay as I am now and not meticulously track everything I eat. \n\nAm I the asshole for not trying harder and accepting the status quo?\n\nAnd since people will ask: my husband himself is very fit, definitely top 5% in his age group.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not trying harder to lose weight as per her husband's expectations.\n\nFirst, the author has a history of significant weight loss, going from 220lb to 125lb. That's a huge achievement and shows she's capable of making changes. Now, she's fluctuating between 140-154lb, which is higher than her current goal of 125lb. Her husband wants her to get back to that 125lb, but she finds it hard and emotionally challenging. He's pushing her, thinking she's not trying hard enough, and even insinuating she's lazy. \n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's disciplined and wants his wife to look better for him. He might feel that she could improve her health and appearance. But the author's side is that weight loss is hard for her, especially with a demanding job. She's not trying as hard as she could, but she's also at peace with her current weight. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and respect. The husband's pressure might be coming from a place of wanting the best for her, but it's not his decision to make. Weight is a personal health issue, and while he can support her, he shouldn't make her feel bad for not meeting his expectations. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to accept her current state, especially if she's not in a harmful situation. She's already made significant progress before. \n\nAlso, the husband's comment about her being lazy and getting fatter as she ages is hurtful and dismissive of her struggles. That kind of attitude can be detrimental to someone's mental health. The author's admission that she isn't trying as hard as she could is her own self-assessment, but she's not obligated to meet his unrealistic standards. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for not meeting her husband's expectations and for choosing her own path regarding her weight.\n"
