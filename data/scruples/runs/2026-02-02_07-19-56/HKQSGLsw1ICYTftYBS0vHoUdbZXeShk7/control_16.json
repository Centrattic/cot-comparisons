He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially since the fianc\u00e9e is dying. The brother is insisting on a full suit, otherwise don't come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Typically, weddings have a dress code, and if it's a formal summer wedding, maybe a suit and tie is expected. But the author is okay with formal attire without the jacket, which is a common variation, especially in hot weather. Some people opt for a suit without the jacket and a tie, especially in summer. So maybe the author is being reasonable.\n\nThen there's the brother's position. He's being very strict, saying full suit or don't come. That seems harsh. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, and if the brother is being inflexible, maybe he's overstepping. The author wants to attend but can't be comfortable in a jacket. Also, the context is a terminally ill fianc\u00e9e, which might make the event more somber or emotionally significant. The brother's insistence could be seen as prioritizing appearance over the attendees' comfort, especially in such a sensitive situation.\n\nThe user's options are A (author wrong) or B (not wrong). The key points are: the author's reason (comfort in hot weather) versus the brother's strict requirement. Social norms suggest that formal attire can vary, and many weddings accept a jacketless suit. The brother's stance might be unreasonable. Additionally, the author's intention to attend shows they care, but they have a valid reason for not wearing the jacket.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking a balance between respect and personal comfort. The brother's demand seems too rigid, especially given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
