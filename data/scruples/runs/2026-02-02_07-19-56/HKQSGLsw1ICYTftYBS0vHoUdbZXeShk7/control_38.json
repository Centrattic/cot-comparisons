He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially given the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social norms around wedding attire. In many Western weddings, men are expected to wear suits and ties, sometimes including a jacket. However, summer weddings can be an exception because of the heat. The user has already mentioned that they offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is a compromise. \n\nThe brother's stance is clear\u2014he wants a full suit or no attendance. But the user's concern is about comfort in hot weather. This seems like a reasonable request. Weddings can have different dress codes, like \"formal\" which might allow for some flexibility, or maybe even \"smart casual\" in summer. The brother might be strict, but is that justified?\n\nAlso, the context of the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness adds sensitivity. The user wants to attend, which shows they care. Refusing to attend over attire might be harsh, but the brother's position could be about maintaining a certain standard for the wedding. However, the user's compromise is a middle ground. \n\nIs the user being disrespectful by not wearing a jacket? Maybe in some contexts, but in a summer setting, especially in a warm climate, not wearing a jacket is common. The user isn't refusing to dress formally\u2014just adjusting for the weather. \n\nThe brother's insistence might stem from wanting the event to look a certain way, but forcing someone to wear a jacket when it's uncomfortable could be seen as unreasonable. The user isn't breaking any major rules; they're just adapting to circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the user isn't in the wrong. They're trying to balance respect and comfort, and the brother's response is overly strict. The answer should be B.\n"
