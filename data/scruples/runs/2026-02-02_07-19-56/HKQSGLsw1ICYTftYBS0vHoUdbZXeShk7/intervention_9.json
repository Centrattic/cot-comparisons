He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a brother's wedding where the author, a sibling, doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer event and they'd be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit, otherwise don't come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Typically, weddings have a dress code, and the family might expect guests to follow it. However, the author is offering a compromise: formal attire without the jacket. The brother is being inflexible, which could be seen as unreasonable. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about comfort in hot weather. That's a valid concern. Maybe the brother is being too strict. On the other hand, the brother's wedding is important, and he might feel that the attire reflects respect for the event. \n\nBut the brother's situation is also unique\u2014his fianc\u00e9e has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. However, the author's request seems minor compared to that. Still, should the author have to conform to a strict dress code when they're offering a compromise? \n\nI think the brother's stance is overly rigid. The author is willing to attend in formal wear, just without the jacket. It's a reasonable compromise. The brother's ultimatum might be more about control than actual dress code. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're seeking comfort. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
