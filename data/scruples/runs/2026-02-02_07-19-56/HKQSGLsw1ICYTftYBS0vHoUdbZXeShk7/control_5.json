He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket, and the brother is making them either wear a full suit or not come at all. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is in the summer, so it's going to be hot. The author is suggesting formal attire without the jacket to stay comfortable. That makes sense because wearing a suit jacket in summer can be really uncomfortable. But the brother is strict about it.\n\nNow, why is the brother being so strict? The fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight to the event. The brother is getting married again, and there's some private comment about maybe the reason for the marriage, but the author isn't saying that out loud. The brother might feel that a full suit is necessary for the formality of the occasion, especially given the circumstances. \n\nBut does the brother have the authority to enforce that? Weddings usually have a dress code set by the hosts, but the brother is the host here. If he's set the dress code as formal attire including a suit jacket, then not following it could be seen as not respecting the event's standards. However, the author is making a reasonable request for comfort in the heat, which is a practical concern. \n\nIs there a compromise possible? Maybe the brother is being inflexible, but maybe there's a cultural or family norm where suits are expected regardless of the season. If that's the case, the author might be expected to follow it. But on the other hand, if the venue is indoors with air conditioning, maybe the heat isn't as much of an issue. The author hasn't mentioned that, though.\n\nAlso, the author's intention to attend is positive. They want to be there for their brother's special day. Refusing to attend over a suit jacket might be seen as petty, but the brother's stance is also being rigid. \n\nI think the key points are: the brother's insistence on a strict dress code versus the author's valid comfort concern. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're just asking for a slight modification. The brother might be overreacting, especially given the emotional weight of the situation. So maybe the brother is the one being unreasonable here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
