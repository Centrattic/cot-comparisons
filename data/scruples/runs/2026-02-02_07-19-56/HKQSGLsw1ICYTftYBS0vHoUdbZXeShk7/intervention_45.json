He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted on AITA is wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The brother is getting married to a partner with terminal cancer, which adds a layer of sensitivity.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the dress code. The author is okay with formal attire but wants to skip the jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'll be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit or no attendance. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings often have formal attire expected, especially for the groom's side. However, summer weddings can be more relaxed. The author is proposing a slight deviation from the norm\u2014no jacket. In many cases, especially in warmer climates or seasons, it's common to wear a suit without a jacket. The brother's strict stance might be about maintaining formality, but the author's discomfort is valid.\n\nAlso, the emotional context: the bride is dying, which might make the brother want everything to be perfect. But the author's request seems reasonable. The brother's ultimatum (full suit or no show) could be seen as inflexible. The author is prioritizing their comfort but also wants to attend. It's possible the brother is overreacting without considering the practicality of a summer wedding. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're compromising by saying formal attire without a jacket, which is a common exception. The brother's response might be unreasonable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
