      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a person not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding because it's a summer event and they think it would be too hot. The brother is insisting on a full suit or not showing up.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The wedding is in the summer, so the author is concerned about the jacket making them uncomfortable. They offered to attend in formal attire without the jacket, but the brother is firm on the full suit. The author is conflicted because they want to attend but don't want to wear the jacket. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is whether that's accurate.\n\nWedding etiquette can vary, but generally, the host (the couple) sets the dress code. If the invitation specifies \"formal\" or \"tuxedo,\" then a suit jacket might be expected. However, summer weddings sometimes have more relaxed options like \"summer formal\" or \"smart casual.\" The author mentioned they offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, which might align with a less strict dress code. But the brother is insisting on a full suit.\n\nNow, considering the context of the brother's fianc\u00e9 having terminal cancer, the wedding might be seen as a significant and somber event. In some cultures or families, formal attire is strictly enforced regardless of the season. The brother could feel that the circumstances warrant a more traditional, respectful appearance. On the other hand, the author's health and comfort are valid concerns. If the heat is a real issue, especially if it's a hot summer, refusing to wear a jacket isn't unreasonable. It's about balancing respect for the event's formality with practicality and personal well-being.\n\nThe author's intention is to attend, which is positive. They are not refusing to go; they just want to adjust their attire. The brother's stance may come from a place of wanting the event to look a certain way, perhaps to honor his fianc\u00e9's wishes or his own. However, the author's refusal to compromise might be seen as disrespectful if the family culture is very traditional. But is the author actually in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the dress code was clearly stated as full suit, then the author might be out of line. But if the author's offer is reasonable and the brother is being inflexible without a clear reason beyond personal preference, then the brother might be the one being unreasonable.\n\nAlso, the author's private thoughts about the brother's motivation (that the marriage is purely because she's dying) might influence their judgment. But that's not relevant to the attire issue. The main issue is the dress code and respect for the event. So, the answer hinges on whether the author's request is reasonable under the circumstances. Since the brother is the one setting the dress code, unless there's a clear expectation of full suits in the invitation, the author's stance could be justified. However, if the brother has the final say on the attire, the author might have to comply to show respect, even if it's uncomfortable. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation.\n"
