      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to wear a suit jacket to a brother's wedding because it's summer and hot. The brother insists on a full suit or not show up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is for a brother who is getting married to someone with terminal cancer. That's a significant and emotional event. The author's brother is also recently divorced, and there's a hint that maybe the marriage isn't ideal, but the author isn't saying that out loud. The main conflict is the attire issue.\n\nNow, the author is a student, and this is a day off school. They want to attend but are uncomfortable wearing a suit jacket in the summer heat. The brother is insisting on a full suit, which could be seen as traditional or formal attire for a wedding. \n\nIn many cultures, weddings are formal events, and guests are expected to dress appropriately. However, summer weddings often have more informal attire options, like suit jackets being optional. The brother's insistence might be about maintaining a certain standard, but the author's discomfort due to heat is a valid concern. \n\nBut here, the brother is being rigid, which could be a problem. The author is trying to compromise by offering formal attire without the jacket. If the brother is not allowing any flexibility, that's part of the issue. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're just seeking comfort. The brother's ultimatum (full suit or don't show up) seems extreme, especially given the emotional weight of the situation. \n\nConsidering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be comfortable. The brother's demand is unreasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
