He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The brother is getting married to someone with terminal cancer, and the wedding is in the summer. The author wants to go in formal attire without a jacket because of the heat, but the brother says it's full suit or nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, suits are expected for men at weddings, especially if it's a formal event. However, summer weddings sometimes have lighter dress codes, like suit and tie without the jacket. The author's reasoning is about comfort due to the weather, which is a valid concern. But the brother is strict, which adds tension.\n\nThe brother's stance might be about maintaining a certain standard for the wedding. Maybe the family or the bride's family has a specific dress code they want to follow. The author's refusal to wear the jacket could be seen as disrespectful, but it's also a personal comfort issue. However, weddings are about the couple, and guests usually comply with their wishes. The author might be overstepping by not respecting the brother's request, even if it's uncomfortable. On the other hand, the brother's insistence could be unreasonable if the heat poses a health risk. But since the author can choose not to attend, maybe they should prioritize family harmony. Hmm.\n"
