He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9 is dying. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is during summer, so it's going to be hot. The person doesn't want to wear a jacket because of the discomfort. They offered to attend in formal attire without the jacket, but the brother is firm on the full suit.\n\nNow, weddings usually have a dress code. If the brother insists on a full suit, maybe there's a reason, like the event's formality or family expectations. But the situation is unique because the fianc\u00e9 is terminally ill. Sometimes, in such cases, families might adjust traditions to be more comfortable. \n\nThe person is trying to balance their comfort with respecting their brother's wishes. They aren't avoiding the wedding; they just want to be comfortable. The brother's stance is strict, but is that unreasonable? It depends on cultural norms and how formal the wedding is. However, considering the fianc\u00e9's condition, maybe the formality isn't as crucial. \n\nAlso, the brother's personal reasons (like the marriage being due to her illness) might add stress, but the user isn't commenting on that. They just want to wear a suit without a jacket. In many summer weddings, suits without jackets are acceptable, especially in hot weather. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the brother is being unreasonable by not accommodating a minor part of the dress code (just the jacket), then the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing their comfort while still attending. But if the family or wedding strictly requires full suits, maybe the author is expected to comply. However, given the terminal illness, maybe the formality is less important than the attendees' well-being. \n\nI think the key points are the summer heat, the offer to wear formal attire without the jacket, and the brother's inflexibility. The author isn't being disrespectful unless the jacket is a non-negotiable part of the dress code. Since they offered a compromise and the brother is rejecting it, the author might not be wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
