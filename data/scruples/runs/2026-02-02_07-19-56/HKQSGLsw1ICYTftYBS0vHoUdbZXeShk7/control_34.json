He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'll be too hot. The brother is insistent on a full suit or not attending at all. The fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds some emotional weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around wedding attire. Traditionally, weddings do have dress codes, but summer weddings are often a bit more flexible. A suit without a jacket might still be considered formal enough, especially in warmer weather. However, the brother is strict about the full suit, which could be about maintaining formality or maybe other underlying reasons.\n\nThe author is trying to balance their comfort with the family expectations. They are willing to attend in formal attire but not the jacket. The brother's stance is either full suit or not attend. But is the brother being unreasonable here? Maybe the venue or the couple's specific dress code is strict. But the author is a sibling, so there might be some leeway expected.\n\nThe emotional aspect of the fianc\u00e9's illness might be influencing the brother's decision. However, the author's discomfort in a suit jacket during summer is a valid personal issue. The brother's insistence could be seen as not considering the author's needs. On the other hand, the author is choosing not to comply with the dress code, which the brother set. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to see who is the asshole based on reasonableness and empathy. The author is trying to be respectful by attending in formal attire but without the jacket, which might be acceptable. The brother, however, is being rigid. The author isn't in the wrong here because they are making a reasonable request for comfort while still adhering to the formality. The brother's response is inflexible, so the author isn't the asshole.\n"
