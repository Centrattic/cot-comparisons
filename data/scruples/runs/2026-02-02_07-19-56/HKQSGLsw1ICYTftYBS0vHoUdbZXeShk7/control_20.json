I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding, and the writer doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother says either wear a full suit or don't come at all. The question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to wear the jacket.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. In many Western weddings, especially formal ones, men are often expected to wear suits and ties. However, summer weddings might have more lenient dress codes. The author mentioned they're willing to wear formal attire without the jacket. Maybe the brother is being rigid about the dress code. \n\nThe brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. The author might feel the situation is sensitive, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to wear a jacket if the dress code isn't strictly enforced. The brother's response seems overly harsh, especially if there's no explicit requirement for jackets. \n\nAlso, the brother is getting married again after a divorce. The author's private thoughts about the marriage's motivations don't affect the dress code issue directly, but they might contribute to tension. However, the main issue is about attire. The author is looking for comfort in a hot climate, which is reasonable. \n\nIn some cases, weddings have a \"smart casual\" or \"semi-formal\" dress code. If the invitation didn't specify a jacket is required, the author's choice could be acceptable. The brother's insistence on a full suit might be based on his own preferences rather than a strict necessity. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are about the couple's wishes, so the brother might feel his event should have certain standards. However, if the author is not in violation of any stated dress code, then the brother is being unreasonable. The key point is whether the author is violating an explicit dress code or not. Since the author said they're happy with formal attire minus the jacket, maybe the brother is being overly strict. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're seeking comfort and the brother's response is extreme. The answer would be B (No).\n"
