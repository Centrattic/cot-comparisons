He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially given the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is about dress code. The brother insists on a full suit, but the author is uncomfortable wearing a jacket in the summer heat. The brother's stance is to either come in a full suit or not come at all. The author feels conflicted because they want to attend but are unwilling to comply with the jacket requirement.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings are formal events, and the dress code is important for the hosts. The brother might be sensitive about the event given his fianc\u00e9's health, wanting everything to be perfect. On the other hand, the author's discomfort is valid\u2014wearing a suit jacket in summer can be uncomfortable, especially in hot weather.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are about respecting the couple's wishes. The brother's request for a full suit is part of ensuring the event is formal and dignified, perhaps as a way to cope with the impending loss. Refusing the jacket could be seen as not respecting the couple's wishes, especially given the circumstances. However, the author is also within their rights to express discomfort. \n\nBut the key point is the brother's ultimatum: full suit or no reception. The author is faced with a choice between personal comfort and attending. In many cultural contexts, respecting the dress code is a sign of respect for the couple's wishes. So, not wearing the jacket might be seen as not taking the event seriously, especially in a sensitive time. However, the author might argue that their health and comfort are also important. \n\nBut the author's stance is that they are willing to attend in formal attire without the jacket, which is still formal but adjusted for the weather. The brother is being rigid. However, the brother's position might be influenced by his own stress and the emotional weight of the situation. \n\nIn such cases, compromise is usually expected. The author is trying to find a middle ground, but the brother isn't budging. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking comfort but the brother's insistence is also understandable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they are not attending out of spite but to attend while being uncomfortable, it's a matter of perspective. The brother's request is part of the event's planning, and attending in a way that disregards the dress code might be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the author's discomfort is valid. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to attend while expressing a reasonable request for comfort. The brother's refusal is perhaps the issue here. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they are trying to attend and are only omitting the jacket for practical reasons, the answer is B.\n"
