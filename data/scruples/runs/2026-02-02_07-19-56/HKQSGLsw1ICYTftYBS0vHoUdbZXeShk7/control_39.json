I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'll be too hot. The brother is insisting on a full suit or no attendance. The fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds some emotional weight to the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. Typically, weddings have a dress code, and summer weddings might sometimes have a more relaxed code, but it's not universal. The author is offering to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is a common variation, like a suit without the jacket and tie, but maybe the brother is strict about the full suit. \n\nThen there's the context of the brother's situation. The fianc\u00e9 is dying, and the brother is getting remarried. The author has their own opinion about the marriage but isn't expressing it. The brother's strictness might be coming from a place of wanting things to be perfect for this important day, perhaps due to the emotional stakes.\n\nThe author's main issue is discomfort from the suit jacket in summer heat. That's a valid concern, especially if the reception is in a hot environment. However, the brother is unwilling to compromise. The author wants to attend but is facing a dilemma between personal comfort and family expectations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are about the couple, so the guests are expected to follow the dress code. If the brother specified a full suit, then not complying could be seen as disrespectful. But the author is trying to meet the formal attire requirement by removing only the jacket. Maybe the brother is being overly strict, but it's still their event. Alternatively, maybe the author could find a lighter suit or a breathable fabric. But the key point is the author's stance versus the brother's demand.\n\nIn some cultures, wearing a suit without a jacket is acceptable, especially in warm weather. However, if the brother is firm, then the author might be in a tough spot. The question is whether the author is wrong for not complying. If the invitation didn't specify the dress code clearly, maybe the brother is being unreasonable. But if it's a traditional full suit, the author's refusal could be seen as not respecting the couple's wishes. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's position is understandable due to the heat, but the brother's insistence on full suit is about the event's formality. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how strict the dress code is. But since the author is trying to attend and is compromising by at least wearing formal attire, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the couple specifically asked for full suits, then the author's refusal could be seen as not following the rules. But given the context of the brother's situation, maybe leniency is expected. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. The answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful.\n"
