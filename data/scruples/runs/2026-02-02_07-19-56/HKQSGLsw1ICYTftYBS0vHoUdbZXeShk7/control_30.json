He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother is strict about wearing a full suit or not showing up at all. The fianc\u00e9 is terminally ill, which adds some emotional weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Typically, weddings have a dress code, and in many cases, a suit and tie is formal attire. If the wedding specifies formal wear, refusing to follow it could be seen as disrespectful. However, the user is proposing to skip the jacket, which might still be considered formal depending on the context.\n\nBut the brother's stance is strict\u2014either full suit or don't come. That seems harsh. The user is trying to compromise by offering formal attire without the jacket. Maybe the brother is being overly rigid. Also, the user is concerned about comfort in summer, which is a valid point. Heat can be an issue, especially in a suit. If the wedding is outside, maybe the heat is even worse. \n\nThe emotional aspect: the bride has terminal cancer. This could make the wedding more significant, so the brother might feel the need to maintain certain standards. But is the user's request unreasonable? Skipping the jacket might still be formal enough, especially if it's a summer event. Some people opt for less traditional suits in the summer, like linen suits or lighter fabrics. \n\nIs there a way to compromise? Like a blazer with the suit? Maybe the user could find a lightweight jacket. But they specifically don't want to wear a jacket. The brother's response is an ultimatum, which might not be fair. The user is attending out of respect, so being forced to wear a jacket they're uncomfortable with could be a conflict of values.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They're trying to balance respect for the event with their own comfort. The brother's demand seems inflexible. The key points are the dress code's flexibility, the user's compromise, and the brother's rigid stance. The user isn't being disrespectful; they're following the formal attire suggestion but adjusting for practicality and comfort.\n"
