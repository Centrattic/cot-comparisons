He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially with the context that the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. \n\nFirst, the wedding is in the summer, so heat is a concern. The author is okay with formal attire without the jacket. The brother insists on a full suit or no attendance. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Typically, weddings have a dress code. If the brother specified full suit, the author is going against that. However, the situation is complicated by the fianc\u00e9's illness and the author's discomfort with the jacket. \n\nBut the brother's stance is firm, and the author is considering skipping the wedding over this. Is the issue really about the jacket? Maybe the underlying problem is about family expectations versus personal comfort. \n\nIn some cultures, not following the dress code could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's reasoning is valid due to the summer heat. The brother's insistence might be inflexible. \n\nIs the author wrong for prioritizing comfort over the dress code? Or is the brother being unreasonable? The author isn't being disrespectful by not attending, but maybe the brother is overreacting. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the dress code was clearly set and if the brother is being too strict. Since the author tried to compromise and the brother refused, maybe the brother is in the wrong. But the user's question is about the author's fault. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're making a reasonable request for comfort, and the brother's stance is rigid. So, answer B (No).\n"
