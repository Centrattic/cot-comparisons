He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially given the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is in the summer, so heat could be an issue. Suits can be uncomfortable in hot weather. The author offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is a common practice in some places, especially for more casual or summer events. However, the brother is insisting on a full suit.\n\nNow, the brother's situation is sensitive. His fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. The author's brother might be particular about the wedding attire to make the event as perfect as possible for her, maybe to honor her wishes. But is that a valid reason to enforce strict dress code?\n\nThe author's concern is comfort versus the brother's insistence. The key here is whether the author has a reasonable expectation to dress comfortably in a summer wedding. In many cultures, men can wear a suit without a jacket, especially in hot weather. The brother's stance might be inflexible, but does that make the author wrong?\n\nAlso, the author is trying to attend, which shows they care. They're just seeking a compromise. The brother's response of \"come in a full suit or don't come at all\" seems extreme. It's possible the brother is under stress from the situation with his fianc\u00e9, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing comfort.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable request, and the brother's refusal is the issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
