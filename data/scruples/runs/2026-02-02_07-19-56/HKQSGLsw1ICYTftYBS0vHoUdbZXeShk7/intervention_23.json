He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, and the wedding is in the summer. The author is being told they have to wear a full suit or not attend at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. In many places, especially for formal weddings, a suit and tie is standard for men. The brother is enforcing this, possibly because of the formality of the event. But the author is uncomfortable in a suit jacket during the summer heat. That's a valid concern.\n\nThen there's the context of the marriage. The author's brother is remarrying, and there's a hint that the marriage might be partly due to the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness. The author is in a sensitive situation, maybe feeling conflicted about attending, but the main issue here is the attire.\n\nThe key points are: the author's discomfort vs. the family's expectations. Is the author being unreasonable by not wearing a jacket? Or is the brother being overly strict? In some cultures, not wearing a jacket could be seen as disrespectful. However, considering the weather and personal comfort, maybe the brother is being inflexible.\n\nAlso, the author wants to attend for the day off and the reception, which suggests they don't want to miss out. The brother's ultimatum might be unkind, especially given the circumstances. If the wedding is in summer, maybe the attire could be adjusted for comfort. Some weddings in hot weather do allow more breathable fabrics or offer alternatives.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They're expressing a reasonable concern about comfort. The brother's demand for a full suit without consideration for the heat could be the problem. The author is trying to find a middle ground (formal attire without the jacket), which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
