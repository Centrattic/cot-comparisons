He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket due to the summer heat. The brother insists on a full suit, threatening to exclude the author if they don't comply.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is during summer, so the heat is a valid concern. The author is offering to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is still formal but more comfortable in warm weather. The brother is being rigid, possibly due to the situation's emotional weight. The author wants to attend but is conflicted over the dress code.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should evaluate if the author's stance is unreasonable. Wearing a suit jacket in summer can be uncomfortable, and many weddings do offer alternatives like a jacket-less suit or more breathable fabrics. The brother's insistence on a full suit might be about maintaining formality or tradition, but given the circumstances (a wedding during a terminal illness), maybe flexibility is expected.\n\nThe author's request seems reasonable. They're compromising by agreeing to formal attire without the jacket. The brother's response is ultimatum-based: attend in full suit or not at all. That's a strong stance. In many cases, family events require some flexibility, especially when there are health or comfort issues. The author is not being disrespectful but seeking comfort. The brother's rigidity might stem from stress or wanting to honor the occasion, but it's not entirely fair to exclude someone over a dress code when they're offering to dress formally otherwise.\n\nAlso, the context of the brother's fianc\u00e9 having terminal cancer adds emotional weight. The brother might be under pressure to make everything perfect, but that doesn't justify an unreasonable demand. The author's priority is attending the event, which is important, so not attending because of discomfort isn't ideal. However, the brother's insistence seems inflexible. \n\nIn terms of social norms, dress codes can be flexible. If the brother is strict about the suit, maybe the author could suggest a compromise, like a lighter fabric suit jacket or a blazer. But the brother isn't open to that. The author's position isn't about defiance but about practicality and comfort. Therefore, the brother's stance is more problematic here. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their comfort in a formal setting, especially when the alternative is not attending, which would be a bigger issue.\n"
