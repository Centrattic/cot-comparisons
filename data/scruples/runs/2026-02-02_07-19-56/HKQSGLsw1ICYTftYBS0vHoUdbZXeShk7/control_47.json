He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother's wedding where the fianc\u00e9e is terminally ill. The author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. Their brother is insisting on a full suit or no attendance.\n\nFirst, consider the context. Weddings often have dress codes, but the author is flexible\u2014they're offering formal attire without the jacket. The brother is strict, but maybe he's under pressure from the fianc\u00e9e's side or family traditions. However, the fianc\u00e9e is seriously ill, which adds emotional weight. The author wants to attend, which is respectful, but the jacket issue is causing a conflict.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation that requires a suit jacket in summer? In many places, especially in hot climates, men might wear a suit without a jacket, or at least a lighter jacket. The author's compromise is reasonable. The brother's stance seems rigid. Also, the brother's situation is emotionally complex, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to prioritize their comfort.\n\nThe key points: the author is trying to attend, is willing to dress formally except for the jacket, and the brother is refusing to budge. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're seeking a practical solution. The brother might be projecting his own stress onto this dress code. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
