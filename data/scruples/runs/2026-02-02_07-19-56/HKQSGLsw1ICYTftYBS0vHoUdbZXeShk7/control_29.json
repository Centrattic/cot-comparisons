      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a wedding where the brother is getting married to someone with terminal cancer. The person in question doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit or no showing up.\n\nFirst, I need to think about social norms regarding wedding attire. Weddings usually have dress codes, which can be strict depending on the family or culture. A summer wedding might be more lenient, but still formal. The person says they're okay with formal attire except the jacket. But the brother is refusing to let them attend without the jacket. \n\nThe person's reasoning is comfort\u2014being too hot. That's a valid concern, especially in summer. Maybe the brother is being overly strict. But why is he so insistent? Maybe he's under stress because of his fianc\u00e9's illness, or he wants everything to be perfect. The user mentions that the brother's previous marriage ended in divorce, and there's a hint that the current marriage might be for emotional reasons. But that's just the user's private thought, not something they can discuss.\n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, suits are mandatory for men, and not wearing a jacket might be seen as disrespectful. However, in other contexts, especially summer weddings, maybe a blazer isn't necessary. The key is whether the brother's demand is unreasonable. The user is offering to wear formal attire minus the jacket, which is still formal but more comfortable. If the brother is being inflexible, maybe he's overstepping.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional weight of the situation\u2014the impending death of the fianc\u00e9\u2014could the brother be projecting his stress onto this issue? The user wants to attend, so refusing to come would be a loss for the brother. The user isn't trying to be disrespectful; they just want to be comfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might feel that the wedding is important, and the attire reflects the event's significance. But if the user is a family member, there's a right to some level of personal comfort. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a lighter suit or a breathable jacket. But if the brother is unwilling to compromise, the user might have to decide between their comfort and attending. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the user isn't violating any major social rule by not wearing a jacket if the wedding allows for some flexibility. The brother's stance could be seen as unreasonable if it's causing the user to miss the event. So, the answer might lean towards the user not being in the wrong. They're prioritizing their own comfort in a situation that's already stressful for the family. The brother's strictness might be excessive, especially given the circumstances.\n"
