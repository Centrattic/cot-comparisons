He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness. The author's brother is insisting on a full suit or not attending at all. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wedding is in summer, so the author is uncomfortable with a full suit jacket because of the heat. They're offering to wear formal attire without the jacket, which seems reasonable. The brother is being strict about the attire, possibly because of the solemnity of the occasion given the fianc\u00e9's illness. The author wants to attend but is conflicted about the dress code.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms. In many Western weddings, especially formal ones, the expectation for men is a suit and tie, sometimes including a jacket. However, summer weddings might have more relaxed attire, like a suit without a jacket or even lighter options. The author is proposing to wear formal attire without the jacket, which could be seen as appropriate if the venue and climate make a jacket impractical.\n\nThe brother's insistence on a full suit might be about maintaining formality and showing respect for the couple. If the wedding is a significant event, especially under these circumstances, the brother might feel that the attire should reflect the gravity of the occasion. However, the author is compromising by offering to attend in formal wear minus the jacket, which is still respectful but more comfortable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the wedding's dress code is explicitly a full suit, then not wearing a jacket could be a breach. But if the dress code isn't strictly enforced or if the venue is typically more casual, the author's choice is reasonable. The brother's reaction seems extreme, making it an all-or-nothing situation. That might suggest the brother is overreacting, especially if the author's attire is still formal enough.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional aspect. The fianc\u00e9's illness adds a layer of sensitivity. The brother might want the wedding to be a traditional, dignified event, but insisting on a full suit in summer heat could be seen as inconsiderate towards the guests' comfort. There's a balance between respect and practicality here.\n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They're trying to attend and show up in formal attire but are practical about the weather. The brother's demand is rigid, which might not be necessary. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're making a reasonable compromise, and the brother's stance is the main issue here.\n"
