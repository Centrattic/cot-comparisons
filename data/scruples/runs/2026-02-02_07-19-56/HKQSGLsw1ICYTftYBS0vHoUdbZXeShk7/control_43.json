He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding, but the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. The writer doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'll be too hot. The brother says either wear the full suit or don't come at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings have dress codes, and summer weddings might still expect formal attire, especially if it's a family event. However, the writer is making a request to not wear the jacket for comfort. The brother is being very rigid, which might be a problem.\n\nBut the brother's fianc\u00e9 is dying, so there's added emotional weight. The writer might feel conflicted between respecting the occasion and personal comfort. The brother's stance of \"full suit or nothing\" seems extreme. The writer isn't refusing to attend entirely, just adjusting their attire for a valid reason\u2014heat discomfort. \n\nAlso, the brother is in a different situation, possibly dealing with the terminal diagnosis of his fianc\u00e9. Maybe he's stressed and not handling things as flexibly. The writer's compromise is reasonable. Not wearing a jacket in summer is common in many places, especially if it's a warm season. The brother's response could be seen as inflexible. \n\nThe user might be testing if personal comfort is less important than family expectations. In many cases, family gatherings require some compromise, but there's also merit in respecting individual needs. The key here is whether the brother's demand is unreasonable. Since the writer is still dressing formally minus the jacket, which is a common adjustment in many cultures, the brother's insistence might be the issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Their request is reasonable, and the brother's refusal is more about being strict rather than the situation demanding a full suit. The answer should be B.\n"
