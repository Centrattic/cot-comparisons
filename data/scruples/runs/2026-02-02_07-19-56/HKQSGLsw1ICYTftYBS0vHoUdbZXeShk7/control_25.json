He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially given the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. Weddings often have specific dress codes, and summer weddings might still expect formal wear. However, the user is talking about just not wearing the jacket. In many places, a suit without a jacket (like just a dress shirt and slacks) might still be considered semi-formal or acceptable, especially in warmer weather. But it depends on the specific event's expectations.\n\nThe brother is strict about the full suit, so there's a conflict here. The user's reasoning is comfort due to the heat, which is a valid concern. The brother's insistence might be about maintaining formality, but the user's refusal isn't out of disrespect\u2014it's about practicality. The situation is complicated by the fianc\u00e9's illness, which might add pressure to attend and dress formally, but that shouldn't override the guest's comfort if it's reasonable.\n\nI should also consider the relationship dynamics. The user is a sibling, so there's a family obligation. However, personal discomfort shouldn't be dismissed as wrong if it's a reasonable request. Maybe the brother is being overly rigid. The key here is whether not wearing a jacket is a significant breach of the dress code. If the wedding is formal, maybe the user should find a compromise, like a lighter jacket or a breathable fabric. But if the venue and guest list are more relaxed, the brother's stance might be unreasonable.\n\nAnother angle: the user is a student, so maybe they have a different view on formality compared to the older brother. The brother's previous marriage and current situation might make him more insistent on certain traditions. However, the user's main point is not to wear the jacket, not to skip the event entirely. The brother's ultimatum seems extreme. In many cases, families can be flexible, especially in such sensitive circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for not wanting the jacket, and the brother's response is too harsh. The answer should be B.\n"
