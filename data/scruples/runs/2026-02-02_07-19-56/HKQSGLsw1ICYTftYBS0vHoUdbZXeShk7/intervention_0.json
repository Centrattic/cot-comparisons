He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket, and their brother is insisting on a full suit or not attending. The author's concern is about being uncomfortable in the heat, and the brother is getting married to a terminally ill partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. In many Western weddings, especially formal summer ones, a suit and tie is common. However, summer heat can make a suit jacket uncomfortable. The author is willing to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is a compromise. The brother is being rigid, requiring a full suit or no attendance.\n\nThe author's stance is about personal comfort and practicality. The brother's position might be about maintaining formality or perhaps the bride's preferences. The fact that the bride is terminally ill adds emotional weight. Maybe the family is under stress, leading to higher sensitivity about traditions.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author is compromising (formal attire minus jacket), the brother is being inflexible. The author's request is reasonable in a hot climate. Weddings do have dress codes, but they can vary. If the brother is setting a strict rule, is the author wrong to not comply?\n\nOn one hand, respecting the family's wishes is important, especially in such a significant event. On the other hand, the author is not being disrespectful; they are just adjusting for comfort. Maybe the brother is being overly strict. So, considering the author's perspective, they're not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
