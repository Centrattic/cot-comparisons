      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a summer wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because they'd be too hot, but the brother insists on a full suit or no show.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. Traditionally, weddings are formal events, and summer weddings might still require suits, especially if it's a family or religious event. However, some summer weddings do have more relaxed dress codes, like linen suits or less formal attire. The brother might be adhering to a specific dress code, possibly influenced by the family's expectations or the venue's requirements.\n\nThe author's main issue is not wanting to wear a jacket due to the heat. That's a practical concern. But the brother is being very strict, which could be seen as overly rigid. The author is trying to compromise by offering formal attire without the jacket. The brother's response seems inflexible, which could be the root of the problem here.\n\nNext, the context of the wedding: the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. This adds emotional weight. The brother's insistence might come from wanting the ceremony to be perfect for her, given her condition. But is the suit requirement really necessary? Maybe the brother is trying to make the event as traditional or beautiful as possible, but perhaps he's not considering the guests' comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a family member attending a significant event. Should they be more accommodating, even if it's uncomfortable? There's a balance between respecting the couple's wishes and personal comfort. The author isn't refusing to dress formally entirely\u2014they're just not wearing a jacket. That's a small part of formal attire. Maybe the brother is overreacting.\n\nBut also, weddings are the couple's day. They get to set the rules, including dress code. If they specified formal attire, guests are expected to comply. However, in some cultures, slight variations are accepted, especially if the weather is hot. The brother might be strict, but if the dress code was communicated as \"suit and tie,\" then the author's approach is technically not following it. But the brother's response of \"full suit or don't come\" is extreme. Most people would adjust, but maybe the brother is under stress from his fianc\u00e9's situation, leading to heightened emotions.\n\nThe author is also a student, so missing the wedding isn't an option if they have the day off. But they might be caught between their brother's demands and personal discomfort. The key here is whether the brother is being unreasonable. If the wedding venue or culture allows for some flexibility, the brother's stance is too harsh. If not, the author might have a point in trying to find a compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, the brother's inflexibility might be making him the asshole here, but the author not following the dress code could also be seen as disrespectful. However, since the author is trying to meet halfway (formal attire without the jacket), and the brother is not budging, the brother's behavior is the issue. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
