He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around weddings. Typically, weddings have a dress code, and summer weddings might have something like \"smart casual\" or \"semi-formal.\" But the brother insists on a full suit, which might be traditional. However, the fianc\u00e9's illness adds a layer of sensitivity.\n\nThe user argues that the author is in the wrong, but I should check if there's room for compromise. The author is willing to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is still dressy. The brother's stance seems strict, but maybe there's a reason\u2014perhaps family expectations or the wedding's formality. However, in many places, especially in summer, not wearing a jacket is common and acceptable. \n\nAlso, the author's discomfort due to the heat is a valid concern. Health and comfort shouldn't be overlooked. If the brother is being inflexible, maybe it's because of his own stress or the situation's gravity, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for prioritizing their own comfort. \n\nThe key points are: Is refusing a jacket a breach of etiquette? Does the terminal illness affect how strict the dress code should be? And, is the author's compromise reasonable? Considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong because their request is reasonable and they're still attending in appropriate attire, just without the jacket. The brother's insistence might be overly rigid, especially in a warm climate. So, the answer would be B.\n"
