He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially given the context of the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness.\n\nFirst, weddings often have dress codes, but the author is concerned about the suit jacket in summer heat. They mentioned being comfortable in formal attire without the jacket. The brother's strict stance of full suit or no attendance is a problem here. \n\nTerminal illness and a summer wedding might affect the formality expectations. Maybe the family is dealing with emotional stress, so flexibility could be appreciated. The author's reasoning is about personal comfort and health\u2014being too hot could be a valid concern. \n\nThe brother's position seems inflexible. Weddings are important events, but enforcing a strict dress code when there's a valid reason might not be necessary. The author isn't being disrespectful; they just want to comply with formal attire but without the jacket. \n\nConsidering cultural norms, some may argue that formal events require full suits, but others might see the exception here. The brother's insistence could be causing unnecessary tension. The author isn't refusing to dress formally, just one part. \n\nAlso, the brother's situation with the fianc\u00e9's illness might mean the wedding is more about being together at the end. Maybe the focus should be on presence and support rather than dress code. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to balance respect with personal comfort. The brother's inflexibility is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
