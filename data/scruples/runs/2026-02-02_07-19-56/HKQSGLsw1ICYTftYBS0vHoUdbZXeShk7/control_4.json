      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding where the fianc\u00e9e has terminal cancer. The author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'll be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit or no attendance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around wedding attire. In many formal weddings, especially if it's a summer wedding, sometimes the dress code is specified. If the brother is strict about a full suit, maybe there's a family tradition or a specific reason for the dress code. However, the author is making a reasonable request for formal attire without a jacket, which in some contexts, like summer weddings, might be acceptable. \n\nThe brother's fianc\u00e9e's illness adds emotional weight. The author wants to attend out of respect and support but is being denied due to dress code. The brother's stance seems rigid. But maybe there's a deeper reason\u2014like family expectations or the fianc\u00e9e's wishes. However, the author isn't the one making the rules; they're just following the brother's demand.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wearing a jacket? It depends on the context. If the wedding is formal and the brother has specified no exceptions, the author might be seen as disrespectful. But if the dress code isn't strictly enforced by others, the author's choice could be reasonable. The brother's requirement to wear a jacket might be a matter of personal preference or family tradition, but it's not a universal rule. \n\nAlso, the author is trying to compromise by agreeing to formal attire without the jacket. The brother's refusal to attend otherwise might be an overreaction. Considering the emotional context of the wedding, maybe the brother is trying to make the event look as formal as possible, possibly to honor the fianc\u00e9e or to make the occasion special. \n\nHowever, the author's discomfort due to heat is a valid concern. If the wedding is in a hot climate, not wearing a jacket could be more practical. The key here is whether the author's choice is respecting the event's formality. If the wedding is formal and the brother insists on a full suit, the author might be in the wrong. But if the dress code isn't strictly a full suit (maybe the brother is misinterpreting the formality), then the author isn't. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the brother's requirement is reasonable. Since the author is trying to comply with formal attire minus the jacket, which is a common practice in some settings, the brother's insistence could be seen as unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
