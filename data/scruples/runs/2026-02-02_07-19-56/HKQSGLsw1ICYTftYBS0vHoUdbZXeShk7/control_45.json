      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The situation is that the brother is getting married to someone with terminal cancer, and the brother is insisting on a full suit for the summer wedding. The AITA doesn't want to wear the jacket because it's too hot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings often have dress codes, and formal attire usually includes a suit jacket. However, the wedding is in summer, which is typically warmer, so maybe the dress code is expected to be a bit more relaxed, like a suit without a jacket. The brother might be strict about the dress code for formality's sake, but the AITA is making a reasonable request for comfort.\n\nThe brother's fianc\u00e9 is dying, which adds emotional weight. The AITA might feel that the brother is being overly rigid, especially when the request is for comfort. However, the brother might see the dress code as important for the wedding's formality. It's possible that the brother is using the dress code as a way to exert control, especially given his recent divorce and the circumstances of the marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, the AITA is compromising by agreeing to formal attire minus the jacket. If the brother is insistent on the jacket, but the AITA is willing to attend without it, maybe the brother is being unreasonable. The AITA's main issue is comfort, which is a valid concern, especially in summer. \n\nIs there a cultural or familial expectation that requires the jacket? If the wedding is in a more traditional setting, the jacket might be expected. But in a relaxed summer setting, maybe not. The key here is that the AITA is not refusing to attend; they're just asking for a slight modification. The brother's insistence on a full suit could be seen as inconsiderate of the AITA's comfort. \n\nConsidering all this, the AITA is not in the wrong. They are trying to balance their comfort with attending the wedding. The brother's rigidity might be the issue here, not the AITA's request. So the answer is B.\n"
