He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves not wanting to wear a full suit jacket to their brother's wedding, which is happening before the fianc\u00e9's death. The brother is adamant about a full suit, so if the person doesn't comply, they won't be allowed to attend. The person wants to go but is uncomfortable with the jacket.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is for a brother, which is a family event. The fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, and the brother is getting married again, with some private doubts about the marriage's motives. The person's main issue is the discomfort of wearing a suit jacket in summer. They offered to attend in formal attire without the jacket but the brother is refusing, leading to a potential conflict.\n\nNow, the key points here are about cultural expectations around formal attire for weddings, personal comfort, and family dynamics. Weddings often have dress codes, and not following them can be seen as disrespectful. However, the person is willing to comply with formal attire except for the jacket. The brother is strict, which might indicate that he's sensitive about the event's formality due to the circumstances (his fianc\u00e9's illness, previous marriage, etc.).\n\nOn one hand, the author is making a reasonable request for comfort, especially in summer. It's a common issue\u2014many people prefer lighter clothing in warm weather. The brother's stance could be seen as inflexible. On the other hand, weddings are important events, and the brother might feel that maintaining formality is crucial for the day's significance, especially given the emotional weight of the situation.\n\nThe user's brother might be projecting his own stress or the gravity of the situation (marrying someone terminally ill) onto the dress code. But is it fair to exclude someone from attending a family event because of a minor deviation in dress? The person isn't refusing formal attire entirely, just one component. The brother's all-or-nothing approach might be the problem here.\n\nI should also consider the emotional aspect. The author wants to attend, which shows they care. The brother's strictness could be causing unnecessary conflict. In terms of etiquette, while there are traditions, they can sometimes be flexible. The brother's requirement might be more about control or his own anxieties rather than a genuine cultural norm.\n\nSo, putting it together: The author is not being inconsiderate; they're trying to balance respect and comfort. The brother is being rigid. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
