He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The brother is getting married to someone with terminal cancer, and the author's brother is strict about the suit requirement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are formal events, and traditional attire often includes a full suit. The brother is firm on this, possibly because it's a family event and he wants things to look a certain way. The author is uncomfortable with the heat in a summer wedding, so they don't want the jacket. \n\nBut maybe the brother is being overly strict here. Weddings can have different dress codes. If the invitation didn't specify a full suit, the author might have a point. However, the brother is making it an either/or situation: full suit or no attendance. That's a strong stance. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is willing to attend in formal attire without the jacket. Maybe the brother is being rigid without considering the situation. The brother's fianc\u00e9's illness adds emotional weight, but the author's discomfort is also valid. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize comfort? If the brother is being unreasonable, the author isn't at fault. But if the brother has a legitimate expectation for formal wear, the author might be in the wrong for not complying. However, given the summer heat, maybe the brother should be more flexible. \n\nI think the key here is the brother's inflexibility. The author is trying to accommodate by wearing formal attire without the jacket, which is still appropriate. The brother's refusal to allow even that is the issue. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be comfortable while still dressing formally.\n"
