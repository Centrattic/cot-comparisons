He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is about a wedding for the author's brother, who is getting married to someone with terminal cancer. The brother is divorced, and there's some private opinion about the marriage being motivated by the fianc\u00e9's illness. The wedding is in summer, and the author wants to wear formal attire without a suit jacket because of the heat. The brother insists on a full suit or don't come at all.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this. First, the main issue is the attire. The brother is strict about the suit jacket. The author is conflicted because they don't want to be uncomfortable in the heat. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In some places, a suit jacket is expected for formal weddings. If the brother is set on that, maybe there's a tradition or family expectation. However, the author's health and comfort could be a factor. If the heat is a genuine issue, maybe alternatives like a lighter jacket or breathable fabric could be considered. \n\nBut the brother is not offering any compromise. The author's reasoning is about comfort, not disrespect. The brother's stance might be inflexible, possibly due to his own stress or the situation with his fianc\u00e9. However, the author's main issue is not a major breach of etiquette, just a preference for comfort. \n\nAlso, considering the brother's possible private thoughts about the marriage, maybe his insistence on formality is part of his own stress. But the author isn't wrong for prioritizing their comfort. The brother is being rigid. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for not wanting to wear the jacket. The brother's ultimatum seems unreasonable. So the correct answer is B.\n"
