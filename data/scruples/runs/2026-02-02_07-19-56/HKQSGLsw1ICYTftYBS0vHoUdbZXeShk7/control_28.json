He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is a brother's wedding where the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. The brother is insisting the writer wear a full suit, including the jacket, even though it's a summer wedding and the writer is uncomfortable because of the heat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The writer wants to attend but without the jacket. The brother is strict, saying either a full suit or don't come. The writer values attending but is concerned about comfort. The brother is getting married to someone dying, which adds emotional weight.\n\nNow, considering social norms. Weddings usually have dress codes, but summer weddings can sometimes allow for more casual formalwear. If the brother is enforcing a strict dress code, maybe there's a family tradition or a desire to maintain formality despite the season. However, the writer's discomfort is valid, especially in hot weather. Health and comfort shouldn't be ignored, especially in a stressful time.\n\nThe brother's situation: his fianc\u00e9 is dying, which makes the wedding bittersweet. The writer might feel pressure to comply with the brother's wishes out of respect. But is the brother's demand unreasonable? Maybe the brother is trying to make the event as formal as possible to honor the occasion, even if it's in summer.\n\nIs the writer being disrespectful by not wearing a jacket? It depends on the specific cultural or family expectations. If the dress code is explicitly stated as full suit, then the writer might be in the wrong. However, if there's no such code and the request is from the brother, perhaps the writer is justified in seeking comfort, especially since it's a summer event.\n\nAlso, the writer's brother's previous marriage and current situation might influence his insistence on formality. But the writer's own discomfort is real. In many societies, summer weddings might have options like dressy shirts and trousers without jackets. So the writer's request isn't unreasonable. The brother's ultimatum (suit or don't come) is extreme. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? If there's no strict dress code and the brother is making a personal demand, the writer isn't wrong for prioritizing comfort. However, if the family or cultural norms strongly emphasize formal suits regardless, then maybe the writer should comply. But given that it's summer and the brother is being rigid, the writer's position is understandable. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the writer is not in the wrong). They have a valid reason for discomfort and the brother's ultimatum is unreasonable.\n"
