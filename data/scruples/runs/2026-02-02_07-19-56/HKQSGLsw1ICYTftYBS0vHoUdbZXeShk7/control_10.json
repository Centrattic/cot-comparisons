He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding where the brother insists the person wear a full suit, but the person is uncomfortable because of the heat and doesn't want the jacket.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. The person in question is a sibling, so family dynamics matter. The brother is strict about the attire, but the person is willing to wear formal clothes except the jacket.\n\nIs there a cultural or traditional expectation here? In many weddings, the expected attire for men is a suit, which includes a jacket. However, in summer, it's common to have more relaxed options, like a suit without a jacket or even a tuxedo with a tuxedo jacket. But maybe in this case, the brother is being inflexible, perhaps to maintain formality or out of his own emotional reasons.\n\nThe person's main issue is comfort. They're not being disrespectful, they just can't handle the heat. The brother's stance is to exclude them if they don't comply. But is the brother being unreasonable? There's no black-and-white answer here. The person isn't doing anything malicious; they're just seeking comfort in a hot climate. However, the brother might feel the event needs to be formal, especially considering the fianc\u00e9's situation.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional aspect: the fianc\u00e9 is dying. The brother might want the wedding to be as perfect as possible, so maybe he's overcompensating by enforcing strict dress code. The person in question isn't ignoring the event, they just want to adjust the attire for practicality. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, while it's generally expected to dress appropriately, there's flexibility based on the event's formality and the season. If the wedding is formal, a suit without a jacket might not be considered appropriate. But if it's a summer wedding, maybe the dress code is more lenient. However, the brother is the one making the rule here, so he might be overstepping if he's not allowing flexibility.\n\nThe person isn't in the wrong for wanting to be comfortable, especially since they're willing to wear formal attire otherwise. The brother's response of not allowing them to attend without a jacket seems harsh. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
