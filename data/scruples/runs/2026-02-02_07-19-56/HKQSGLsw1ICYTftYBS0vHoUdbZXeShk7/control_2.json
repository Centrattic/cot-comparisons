      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a family wedding where the brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. The writer doesn't want to wear a suit jacket for a summer wedding because it's too hot, but the brother insists on a full suit or not attending at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings are formal events, and attire expectations can vary. The writer is trying to balance comfort with appropriateness. The brother is getting married to someone who's terminally ill, which adds emotional weight. The writer's brother is also divorced, and there's a hint that maybe the marriage is for emotional support, but that's not part of the question here.\n\nThe key issue is the dress code conflict. The writer is asking if refusing to wear a jacket makes them wrong. They've already offered to wear formal attire except the jacket, but the brother is strict. The brother's stance might stem from wanting to present the wedding as traditional despite the circumstances. However, the writer's discomfort in a suit jacket during summer is a practical concern. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some weddings do allow for more flexibility, especially in warmer weather. A suit without a jacket might still be considered formal enough, depending on the venue and culture. The brother's insistence could be seen as rigid, but the writer might not be the one in the wrong if their alternative is still respectful. The emotional context of the wedding (due to the fianc\u00e9's illness) might also make the brother more sensitive to perceived disrespect towards the event's formality.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the writer's request is reasonable. They're not being disrespectful but are seeking comfort, especially given the summer heat. The brother's refusal to compromise could be the issue here. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
