      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a brother's wedding where the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. The person doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'll be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit or not showing up. The person is conflicted because they want to attend but don't want to wear the jacket.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Usually, weddings have a dress code, and for a summer wedding, maybe a suit without a jacket is acceptable, especially in hot weather. But the brother is strict about the full suit. However, the brother's fianc\u00e9 is terminally ill, which adds emotional weight to the event. The person might feel the situation is serious, so they might think formal attire is expected.\n\nOn the other hand, the person is uncomfortable with the heat and the jacket. They proposed a compromise of formal attire without the jacket. The brother refused. Now, is it reasonable for the brother to be so strict? Maybe in some cultures, the suit jacket is important, but in others, it's more about the dress code. If the wedding is in a place where it's customary to be less formal in summer, the brother's insistence might be overly rigid.\n\nAlso, the brother's situation is sensitive. He's marrying someone who's dying, which might make him more anxious about everything being perfect. But the person is trying to be respectful by attending and offering to dress formally except for the jacket. The brother's ultimatum could be seen as unreasonable. \n\nThe key factors here are cultural expectations, the person's discomfort, and the brother's rigid stance. If the wedding's dress code is strict, then the person might be in the wrong by not following it. But if the suit jacket is part of the dress code without a good reason, the brother might be the one being inflexible. \n\nI should also consider that the person is a family member, and the brother might be under stress. However, the person's health and comfort matter too. If the heat could cause discomfort or health issues, that's a valid concern. \n\nIn many summer weddings, especially in warmer climates, it's common to wear slacks, dress shirts, and ties without jackets. So maybe the brother is overreacting by demanding the jacket. The person isn't refusing to dress up; they just want to avoid the jacket. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the person not being in the wrong. The brother's requirement seems too strict given the circumstances. So the answer would be B.\n"
