He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother's wedding where the writer wants to attend without a suit jacket because of the heat, but the brother insists on a full suit or not attend at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wedding is in the summer, which makes wearing a suit jacket uncomfortable. The author is willing to wear formal attire but without the jacket. The brother is strict about the dress code. The author's motivation is comfort, not disrespect. Also, there's some background about the brother's situation with his fianc\u00e9 having terminal cancer, which might add emotional weight to the situation.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms. Weddings usually have a dress code set by the hosts. If the hosts have specified formal attire, guests are expected to comply. However, the author is compromising by offering to wear a suit without the jacket. The brother's insistence on a full suit could be strict, but the author's refusal to comply might be seen as not respecting the hosts' wishes. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is making a reasonable request for comfort in a hot climate. Maybe the brother's demand is too rigid. The author isn't refusing to dress formally; just adjusting slightly for the weather. Is that a valid compromise? \n\nAlso, considering the emotional context of the wedding\u2014given the fianc\u00e9's illness\u2014it might be important for the brother to present the event as he wishes. The author might not want to cause a scene or hurt feelings. However, the author's discomfort could be significant enough that they should not have to suffer, especially if the hosts are flexible.\n\nI think the key here is whether the dress code is strictly enforced. If the brother is insistent, maybe the author should comply, but if there's some flexibility, the author could negotiate. However, since the host is the brother, the guest is expected to follow his rules. The author's stance might be seen as disrespectful. But it's also a personal choice about comfort. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because guests usually comply with the hosts' dress code. The brother's request is for a full suit, and the author's refusal could be seen as not taking the event seriously. However, there's nuance here because of the summer heat and the author's willingness to wear formal attire otherwise. Maybe the brother should be more accommodating, but if he's not, the author is in a tough spot. \n\nHmm. I'm torn. But according to social norms, guests should follow the host's dress code. So maybe the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
