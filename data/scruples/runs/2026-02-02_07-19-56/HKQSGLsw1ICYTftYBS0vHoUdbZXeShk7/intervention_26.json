      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a brother's wedding, and the person doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. Their brother is insisting on a full suit or not show up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. In many Western cultures, weddings often have specific dress codes. A summer wedding might have a more relaxed dress code compared to a winter one, but formal attire like a suit and tie is still common. However, some people might opt for a more casual look, especially in hot weather. The key here is whether the brother's insistence is reasonable given the context.\n\nThe author mentions their brother is getting married to someone with terminal illness, which adds emotional weight. The brother might feel that the wedding is important and wants everything to look proper, maybe to make the day special for his fianc\u00e9. But the author's concern is about comfort, which is valid in hot weather. \n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. Is the author wrong for not wanting to wear a jacket? Well, the brother is asking for a full suit, which includes a jacket. The author is offering formal attire without the jacket, which might still be considered formal enough, depending on the venue and cultural expectations. \n\nIf the wedding is in a place where a suit and tie is acceptable without a jacket, especially in summer, then the author isn't wrong. But if the brother has a specific dress code for the event, maybe due to family traditions or the venue's requirements, then the author might be going against that. But the brother is the one setting the rule here, so the author is not necessarily wrong for having a valid reason to not wear the jacket. \n\nAlso, considering the emotional aspect: attending a loved one's wedding is important. The author's brother is being rigid, which might not be the best approach, but the author's position is about personal comfort versus the brother's insistence on formality. The author isn't being disrespectful; they just want to be comfortable. \n\nAnother angle: Is the brother overstepping by making attendance conditional on wearing a suit jacket? If the author is not in a position to enforce that rule (like if they're not the host), then the brother's stance might be unreasonable. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to attend without the jacket, especially if their alternative is still formal enough. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their request is reasonable, and the brother's refusal is causing the conflict. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
