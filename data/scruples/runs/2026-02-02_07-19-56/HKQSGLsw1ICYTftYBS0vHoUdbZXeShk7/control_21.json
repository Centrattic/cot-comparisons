I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Anon (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The brother is getting married to a fianc\u00e9 with terminal cancer, which adds some emotional weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is in the summer, so it's hot. The author wants to wear formal attire but without a jacket. Their brother is insisting on a full suit or no attendance. The author is conflicted between attending and their discomfort with the suit jacket.\n\nI should think about cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, men might wear suits for weddings, but in some regions or for summer weddings, it's common to go without a jacket, like a suit and tie or even more casual if the venue allows. However, the brother's insistence might stem from wanting the event to look a certain way, especially since it's a significant day for him.\n\nBut the brother's fianc\u00e9 is dying, which adds sensitivity. The author shouldn't want to cause conflict, especially given the emotional stakes. On the other hand, the brother's demand seems a bit rigid. The author has a valid reason for not wearing the jacket due to discomfort in the heat.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the brother could compromise, but if he's not willing, the author might have to choose between attending in a jacket or not attending. However, the author's stance isn't entirely inconsiderate; they are trying to attend but have a legitimate issue. The brother's position might be too strict. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting comfort, especially in hot weather. Weddings can be stressful, and adding discomfort might not be fair. The brother's insistence could be seen as inconsiderate of the author's needs. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any cultural expectations or the emotional context. However, the brother's own situation might make him more sensitive, but the author's request is reasonable. So yes, the author isn't wrong.\n"
