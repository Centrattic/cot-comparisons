He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the Ask MetaFilter post is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness.\n\nFirst, the situation: the brother is getting married, and the fianc\u00e9 has terminal brain cancer. The wedding is in the summer, and the person doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's too hot. Their brother is insisting on a full suit or no attendance. The writer is conflicted between attending and their comfort regarding the suit jacket.\n\nSo, the main points to consider. Weddings often have a dress code, and the family might expect formal attire. However, the writer is making a reasonable request to not wear a jacket due to heat. The brother's stance is strict\u2014either full suit or not attend. The writer wants to go but can't wear a jacket. \n\nIs the writer being inconsiderate? Well, they are attending out of respect, which is important. The brother's insistence on a full suit might be traditional or cultural. However, the situation is sensitive because the fianc\u00e9 is dying. Maybe the brother is under stress and making strict demands. But the writer is also a family member trying to comply as much as possible. \n\nIs the writer wrong? They are asking for a reasonable adjustment to the dress code. Not wearing a jacket in summer heat is practical. The brother is being rigid. The writer isn't refusing to attend entirely; they're trying to find a middle ground. The brother's response seems overly harsh. \n\nAlso, the writer is not the one with the terminal illness, so their comfort is their own. The brother's insistence might be more about his own feelings or the situation's gravity, but that doesn't make the writer wrong for prioritizing their own comfort. \n\nIn such cases, family dynamics can vary. But generally, expecting someone to wear a jacket in hot weather for a wedding might be unreasonable. So the writer isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
