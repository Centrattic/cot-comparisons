He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The situation involves a summer wedding where the brother insists on a full suit, but the author is uncomfortable with the jacket due to the heat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. Generally, weddings do have dress codes, but they can vary. A summer wedding might be more lenient, possibly allowing for lighter formal wear. However, the brother is strict about a full suit, which is traditional for formal weddings. The author is compromising by agreeing to formal attire without the jacket, which is a common practice in warmer weather. But the brother is refusing any deviation, even though the author is making an effort.\n\nNext, the context of the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness adds sensitivity. The brother's insistence might be tied to the importance of the event given the circumstances. However, the author's discomfort is valid. Heat-related discomfort is a real issue, especially in summer. The brother's ultimatum (full suit or don't come) could be seen as inflexible. \n\nThe author's intention to attend is positive, showing respect. The brother's stance might be about maintaining formality, but it's possible he's not considering the practicality of the weather. The author isn't refusing to dress formally\u2014they're just omitting the jacket, which is often acceptable in less traditional settings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wedding's dress code explicitly requires a suit, then the author's refusal might be seen as disrespectful. But if the dress code is more of a suggestion or if the brother is being overly rigid, the author has a valid point. Since the author is making a compromise and the brother is unyielding, it's possible the brother's position is the issue here. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
