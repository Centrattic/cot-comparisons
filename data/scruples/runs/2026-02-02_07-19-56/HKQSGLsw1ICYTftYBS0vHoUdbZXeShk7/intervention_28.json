He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a wedding, specifically the brother's wedding where the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. The author wants to not wear a jacket, but the brother insists on a full suit or not attending. The question is whether the author is wrong for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weddings usually have certain dress codes, especially formal ones. But it's a summer wedding, so maybe the dress code is a bit more flexible. The author is okay with formal attire without the jacket, but the brother is strict. The author is conflicted because they want to attend but don't want to wear the jacket due to discomfort.\n\nNow, the brother's stance might be about maintaining formality, perhaps respecting the occasion, especially given the fianc\u00e9's illness. But the author's reasoning is about personal comfort in hot weather. Is it reasonable to expect a full suit in summer? Maybe in some cultures or regions, but maybe not. The author is trying to balance their comfort with the event's formality.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to wear a jacket? Well, the brother is making it an all-or-nothing situation. The author isn't refusing to attend entirely but is negotiating attire. If the brother is insistent, maybe the author has to comply, but is that fair? The author's stance is about practicality and comfort, which can be valid. However, weddings are about respecting the couple's wishes, especially in such a sensitive situation. The brother might feel that the event is important and wants all attendees to follow the dress code strictly. \n\nBut then again, the author's refusal to wear a jacket isn't a major issue. It's a small part of the attire. The brother's insistence might be seen as overly strict, especially considering the circumstances. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong here because they're making a reasonable request for comfort without refusing to attend. The brother's response is the problem, perhaps being too rigid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They are trying to attend but have a valid reason for not wearing a jacket. The brother's inflexibility is the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
