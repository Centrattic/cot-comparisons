I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the original post is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The wedding is happening when the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, and the brother is divorced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is uncomfortable with wearing a full suit in the summer heat. They offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, but the brother insists on a full suit or not showing up. The author is torn between attending and not wanting to wear the jacket.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the cultural expectations around formal wear at weddings, the sensitivity of the situation with a terminal illness, and the relationship dynamics between the siblings.\n\nIn many Western cultures, weddings are formal events, and dressing appropriately is seen as respecting the couple. A suit jacket is part of formal attire for men. However, the author's discomfort is valid\u2014summer heat can be a real issue. But the brother is firm, possibly because he's in a sensitive situation. Maybe he's under stress due to his fianc\u00e9's illness and wants the wedding to go smoothly and look appropriate, especially since he was previously divorced. There might be added pressure to make this wedding perfect, given the circumstances.\n\nThe author's main issue is the jacket, not the trousers or shirt. But the brother might feel that a suit is a suit, and omitting the jacket breaks the formality. The author is not refusing to dress formally entirely, just part of it. However, the brother is taking a hardline stance.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they are trying to compromise, but the brother isn't budging. The author's request is reasonable\u2014many people adjust their attire for climate, like wearing a tie but no jacket in summer. But perhaps in the brother's mind, the formality is non-negotiable, especially given his own circumstances. The author could be in the wrong if the brother's stance is justified by cultural norms or family expectations. But if the brother is being unreasonable, maybe not. The author's intention is good; they want to attend but are uncomfortable. The brother's response might be excessive. However, the author is not refusing to attend entirely, just negotiating attire. The answer might depend on cultural context, but generally, showing up without a jacket at a formal wedding could be seen as disrespectful, especially in some circles. But considering the heat, maybe it's understandable. However, the brother's insistence might be about control or stress. The author isn't necessarily wrong, but might need to find a middle ground. Alternatively, the brother is being rigid. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B, that they are not in the wrong because their request is reasonable. But maybe the cultural expectation of formal attire is stronger, making A the correct answer. Hmm.\n"
