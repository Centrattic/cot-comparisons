He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit or no attendance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. The author is caught between attending a family event and their personal comfort. The brother's stance is strict, which might be due to the significance of the day or cultural/religious expectations.\n\nThe author argues for formal attire without a jacket, which is formal but not full suit. The brother's refusal to compromise could be about maintaining formality, especially in a cultural context where suits are expected for weddings. However, in summer, light suits or no jacket might be acceptable depending on the region and venue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to be comfortable is understandable. But weddings are formal events, and there's an expectation to dress appropriately. However, the brother's ultimatum might be too harsh. The author's compromise (formal without jacket) is reasonable, but the brother's response is rigid. \n\nCultural norms vary. In some places, a suit without a jacket might be acceptable, especially in summer. But if the brother's culture or the wedding's formality requires a full suit, the author might be expected to comply. However, the brother's insistence on a full suit even when the author is trying to compromise could be the issue here. \n\nThe author's reasoning is valid\u2014comfort in hot weather. The brother's stance seems inflexible. The author isn't refusing all formal attire, just the jacket. So, maybe the brother is overstepping by not allowing a reasonable compromise. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, I think the brother's demand for a full suit is the problem, not the author's preference. The author is trying to balance comfort with attendance. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
