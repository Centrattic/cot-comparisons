He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person writing the question is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The wedding is during summer, and the brother insists on a full suit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. The writer's brother is divorced and remarrying someone who's dying. The writer is offered a day off school and wants to attend but is uncomfortable with the suit jacket because of the heat.\n\nThe key points are about formal attire expectations. The brother is strict about the suit, but the writer is asking if refusing the jacket is wrong. In many cultures, weddings do have dress codes, but summer might be more lenient. However, the brother's insistence on a full suit might be personal or cultural. The writer's concern is about comfort in hot weather.\n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Maybe not. They are following formal attire but adjusting for the season. The brother's stance seems rigid. The writer isn't refusing to attend or dress formally, just one part. The brother's possible reasons (maybe to avoid criticism) might be overstepping. So, perhaps the writer isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
