      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding where the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. The author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. Their brother says come in a full suit or not at all. The author is conflicted because they want to attend but don't want to wear the jacket.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings are formal events, and attire is often specified. However, summer weddings can sometimes be more relaxed, maybe even have a \"summer formal\" dress code. The brother might be insisting on a full suit for formality, but the author is asking for a slight deviation. \n\nThen there's the context of the brother's fianc\u00e9 being terminally ill. The wedding is a significant and emotional event for the family, especially since it's the brother's second marriage. The author's brother is strict about the dress code, which could be due to wanting everything to be perfect given the circumstances. \n\nThe author's argument is about comfort and the heat. Wearing a jacket in summer might be uncomfortable, but suits are typically part of formal attire. However, in some cultures or regions, it's common to wear just a blazer or even go without in very hot weather. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable given the context.\n\nThe brother's response of \"full suit or don't come at all\" seems extreme. While the author might be bending the formal dress code, it's a minor deviation. The brother's insistence might be causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is prioritizing their own comfort over the family's expectations. Weddings are about the couple, so guests usually comply with dress codes. Refusing to follow the dress code could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a family setting where the event is important. \n\nBut considering the summer heat and the terminal illness, maybe the couple could have opted for a more comfortable dress code. However, the author has already expressed willingness to wear formal attire minus the jacket. The brother's refusal might be inflexible. \n\nIn terms of the author's position, they're not refusing to attend entirely but are asking for a small adjustment. The brother's stance seems to be all-or-nothing, which isn't typical unless the dress code is non-negotiable. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's possible they are not, because the dress code request is reasonable and practical. However, if the family has strict traditions, the author might be expected to comply. The brother's response is harsh, but the author's initial request is about comfort. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural expectations and how strict the family is. But given that the brother is being uncompromising, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, since the author is a guest, they might be expected to follow the dress code for the sake of the hosts. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because guests usually comply with the couple's wishes. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the brother is unreasonable, then the author is not wrong. The question is a bit tricky. I need to weigh traditional expectations against the practicality of the situation.\n"
