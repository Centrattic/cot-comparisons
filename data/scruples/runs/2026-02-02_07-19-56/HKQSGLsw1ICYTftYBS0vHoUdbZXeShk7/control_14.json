He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether it's acceptable not to wear a suit jacket to a brother's wedding when the brother is getting married to someone with terminal cancer. The user is considering the situation where the brother is insisting on a full suit, and they don't want to wear the jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around weddings. Usually, weddings have a dress code, and summer weddings might be less formal. However, some weddings might still expect formal attire. The brother is being strict about the full suit, which could be part of the wedding's dress code. The user is offering to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is a compromise, but the brother is not accepting that.\n\nNow, the brother's fianc\u00e9 is terminally ill. This adds emotional weight to the situation. The brother might feel that the wedding is important to be with his fianc\u00e9, so he's setting a firm dress code. The user might feel that the circumstances are unique and that comfort should be considered, especially in the summer heat.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, the brother is the one making the demand here. The user is trying to comply as much as possible by agreeing to formal attire but not the jacket. If the brother is insistent, maybe he's just being rigid, but maybe there's a cultural or family expectation that the user isn't considering. On the other hand, the user's health and comfort could be a valid concern, especially in hot weather.\n\nAlso, considering the user is a student, maybe they're younger or not in a position to argue with their brother. The brother's possible personal issues (divorced, marrying someone dying) might make him more sensitive about how the wedding is perceived. However, the user isn't in the wrong for wanting to be comfortable. Weddings can be stressful, and adding heat from a suit jacket might make it worse for the guest.\n\nSo, the key points are: the user is trying to attend, is respectful by agreeing to formal wear, just not the jacket. The brother is being inflexible. The user's discomfort is valid, especially in summer. The brother's insistence might be about tradition or pride. But is the user wrong for not wanting to comply fully? Probably not. They're making a reasonable request for comfort while still dressing formally. Therefore, the answer should be B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
