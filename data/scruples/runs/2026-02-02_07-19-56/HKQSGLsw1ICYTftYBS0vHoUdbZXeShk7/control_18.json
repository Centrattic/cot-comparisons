He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a family wedding where the brother is getting married to his fianc\u00e9 who has terminal cancer. The author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother is insisting on a full suit or not attending at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around wedding attire. Summer weddings often have more relaxed dress codes, maybe even smart casual. Wearing a suit without a jacket is still formal in some contexts, but the key is whether the brother's demand is reasonable. The author's brother might be insisting on full suit for formality, but the author is uncomfortable.\n\nThen, the emotional aspect. The fianc\u00e9 is dying, so the wedding is a significant and emotional event. The brother might be under immense stress, and the author's refusal to wear a jacket could be seen as a small issue compared to the bigger circumstances. However, the author's comfort is also valid. They should feel respected in their request.\n\nThe author mentions they want to attend but are conflicted. The brother's ultimatum might be an overreaction. Maybe the author could compromise, like wearing a light jacket or a different suit. But the brother's stance is rigid. Is the author wrong for prioritizing their comfort? Or is the brother being unreasonable? \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the actions breach social expectations. The author isn't refusing to attend but is negotiating attire. Since the brother is being inflexible, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The situation is more about the brother's rigidity. So the answer is B.\n"
