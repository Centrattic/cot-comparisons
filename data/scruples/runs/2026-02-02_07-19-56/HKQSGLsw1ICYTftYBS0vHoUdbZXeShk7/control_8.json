He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The brother is marrying someone with terminal cancer, which adds some emotional weight.\n\nFirst, the user's main issue is the discomfort of wearing a suit jacket in summer. They offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, but the brother is adamant. The user wants to attend but is conflicted.\n\nWeddings usually have dress codes, but the user is making a reasonable request. The brother's stance seems strict, maybe to maintain formality. However, considering the circumstances\u2014summer heat and the emotional context\u2014flexibility might be expected. The user isn't being disrespectful; they're prioritizing comfort in a hot environment. Family events can have accommodations for such reasons. The brother's refusal might be inflexible. So, the user isn't in the wrong here. They should probably find a compromise, but the initial request isn't unreasonable.\n"
