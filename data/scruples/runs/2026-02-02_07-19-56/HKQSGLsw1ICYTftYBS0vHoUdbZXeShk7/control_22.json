He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a brother's wedding. The person doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit or nothing. The user is conflicted because they want to attend but don't want to wear the jacket.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings are formal events, and suits are common for men. However, summer weddings might have a more relaxed dress code. The brother might be setting a strict standard, but the person is asking for an exception due to comfort. \n\nAlso, the context of the brother's fianc\u00e9 having terminal cancer adds emotional weight. The person might be under pressure to comply to avoid causing tension. But is that a valid reason to wear a jacket they're uncomfortable with?\n\nThe person's stance is about personal comfort versus family expectations. They've already communicated their preference (formal attire without a jacket) but the brother is firm. Is the brother overstepping by making attendance conditional on wearing a jacket? \n\nIn some cases, family events can have strict dress codes, but it's unusual to exclude someone entirely over attire. The person might have the right to choose their own comfort, especially if the event isn't explicitly requiring full suits. However, the brother might feel it's important for the wedding to look a certain way, perhaps to honor the bride or maintain a formal atmosphere.\n\nI should also think about possible alternatives. Maybe the person could wear a jacket but take it off once inside, or find a lighter material. But the brother's ultimatum leaves little room for compromise. \n\nUltimately, the person isn't doing anything malicious; they're prioritizing their comfort. The brother's insistence might be inflexible without considering the circumstances. So, I think the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to balance their comfort with attending an important event.\n"
