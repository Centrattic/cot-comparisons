He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer. The brother is insisting on a full suit, with no jacket being an option.\n\nFirst, the main issue is dress code. The author is okay with formal attire but wants to skip the jacket due to the summer heat. The brother is taking a hard stance, saying no jacket means no attendance. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many Western cultures, a suit typically includes a jacket, but some events might allow for a more relaxed approach, especially in hot weather. However, weddings, especially formal ones, often expect a certain standard. The brother's insistence could stem from wanting the event to look a certain way, especially given the emotional context of the terminal illness. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is practical\u2014they don't want to be uncomfortable. There's also the emotional aspect: attending a wedding of a sibling is important, but the brother's stance seems rigid. The author might be caught between respecting their brother's wishes and their own comfort. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting family expectations and personal needs. The brother's demand for a full suit seems inflexible, but the author isn't completely refusing\u2014just negotiating. Maybe there's a middle ground, like a lighter jacket or a different fabric. However, the brother's ultimatum complicates things. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while some might think the author should comply, others might see the brother's demand as excessive. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're seeking comfort in a hot climate. The brother's situation is sensitive, but the author's request is reasonable. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
