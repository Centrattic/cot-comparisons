I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to wear a suit jacket to a brother's wedding because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother insists on a full suit or don't come at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Typically, weddings do have dress codes, but sometimes they're more flexible, especially for summer events. If the wedding is formal, then a suit might be expected, but maybe not a jacket. The author is offering to attend in formal attire without the jacket, which is a compromise. \n\nThe brother's stance is strict\u2014either full suit or no showing up. That's pretty rigid. The author is prioritizing their comfort in a situation where the brother is being inflexible. The brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight to the event. Maybe the brother is trying to make everything perfect for her, but insisting on a suit jacket could be seen as overly strict.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about physical comfort. Wearing a suit jacket in summer can be uncomfortable, especially if it's hot. The brother might not be considering the practicality. The author isn't refusing all formal attire, just the jacket, which is a reasonable request. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to wear a jacket? It depends on the wedding's dress code. If it's specified as formal, maybe they should comply. But if it's not explicitly stated, the author's request is understandable. The brother's refusal to compromise might be the issue here. \n\nAlso, considering the brother's possible motivations\u2014maybe he's stressed or wants to honor his fianc\u00e9's wishes. But pushing back on the jacket seems minor in the bigger picture. The author is attending, which is a big gesture, so not wearing a jacket shouldn't be a dealbreaker. \n\nIn terms of etiquette, some weddings might expect a suit and tie but not a jacket. It's more about the formality. The author's approach is reasonable, so the brother's ultimatum is extreme. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Their compromise is acceptable, and the brother's demand is unwarranted.\n"
