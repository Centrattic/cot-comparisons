I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding where the writer doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot. The brother is insisting on a full suit, otherwise, don't come at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around wedding attire. Typically, weddings have a dress code, and summer weddings might be more formal but could also have lighter options like a blazer or a suit without a jacket. However, the brother is being very strict here, which might be part of the issue.\n\nThe writer's main concern is comfort due to the heat. Wearing a suit jacket in summer can be uncomfortable, especially in hot weather. The brother's response seems inflexible, which could be causing tension. The writer is trying to compromise by offering to wear formal attire without the jacket, but the brother's stance is all-or-nothing.\n\nAlso, the context of the fianc\u00e9 having terminal cancer adds emotional weight. The brother might be under stress and overreacting, but that doesn't necessarily justify his rigid demand. The writer isn't being disrespectful; they just want to be comfortable while attending an important event.\n\nSocial etiquette usually allows for some flexibility, especially in hot conditions. If the wedding venue is outdoors or in a place where a jacket isn't typical, the brother's insistence could be unreasonable. However, if the wedding is in a church or a very formal setting, a suit jacket might be expected. The key is whether the writer's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe writer is trying to attend and is being cooperative, which shows they care. The brother's response is the problem here, not the writer's desire for comfort. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
