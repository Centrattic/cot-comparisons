I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted about not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding is in the wrong. The situation involves a summer wedding where the brother insists on a full suit, but the author is uncomfortable because of the heat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. In many Western cultures, weddings are formal events, and guests are expected to dress according to the theme or what's traditional. A summer wedding might have a slightly different dress code, like a cocktail attire or something more casual, but if the brother is insisting on a full suit, maybe the family or the couple is leaning towards formal. However, the author is arguing that the jacket would make them too hot. \n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds a layer of sensitivity. The brother is getting remarried, and the user might feel the need to be respectful. But is a suit jacket really a matter of respect, or is the brother overreaching? \n\nThe author has tried to compromise by offering formal attire without the jacket, showing they're trying to be respectful but have a valid comfort issue. The brother's response is an ultimatum: full suit or don't come. That seems extreme because it's possible to be respectful without the jacket, especially in hot weather. \n\nAlso, the user mentions it's a summer wedding, so practicality matters. Wearing a jacket in the summer can be uncomfortable and might not be necessary for the venue or climate. Some weddings in warmer regions do allow for more breathable fabrics or lighter suits without jackets. \n\nThe brother's insistence might stem from wanting everything to be \"just right\" for the occasion, but he's not considering the guest's comfort. The user isn't being disrespectful by avoiding the jacket; they're adjusting to the weather. The key here is whether the suit is a strict cultural expectation or a personal preference of the couple. If the wedding isn't specifying a black-tie event, then the author isn't in the wrong for dressing in a way that's appropriate for the season. \n\nAdditionally, the user's reason is about comfort, not a refusal to dress formally. The brother's demand to exclude them from the wedding if they don't wear a jacket seems unreasonable, especially since the user is willing to attend and participate. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're prioritizing comfort in a hot climate while still respecting the formality of the event. The brother's ultimatum is too rigid, so the answer should be B.\n"
