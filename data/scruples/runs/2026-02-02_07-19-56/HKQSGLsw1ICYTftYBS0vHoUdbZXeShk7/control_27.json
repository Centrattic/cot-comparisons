He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially given the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness.\n\nFirst, weddings typically have dress codes, and summer weddings might be more casual, but some still require formal attire. The brother insists on a full suit, which is traditional. The author is willing to wear formal attire without the jacket, which is a bit of a compromise. But the brother is taking a hard line\u2014either full suit or don't come. \n\nThe situation is sensitive because the fianc\u00e9 is dying, which adds emotional weight. The brother might be feeling that the occasion should be taken seriously, especially under such circumstances. The author's main issue is comfort due to the heat. However, in many cultures, weddings are expected to be dressed up even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of the brother's possible motivations. The author suspects the brother is getting remarried for reasons others, but they won't voice that. This might affect their emotional stance on attending. However, the core issue here is the dress code. \n\nIs the author unreasonable for not wanting a suit jacket? Maybe not. Some formal events allow for flexibility, like a jacketless suit. But if the brother is strict, the author has to decide between comfort and attendance. \n\nThe author wants to attend but is conflicted. They might be in the right for prioritizing their comfort, but maybe the brother's request is about respecting the significance of the event. It's a tough call. The brother's stance seems rigid, but the author's compromise isn't being accepted. \n\nSo, considering cultural norms and the sensitivity of the situation, the author might not be in the wrong for refusing the jacket, especially since they're willing to wear the pants and shirt. The brother's insistence could be seen as unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
