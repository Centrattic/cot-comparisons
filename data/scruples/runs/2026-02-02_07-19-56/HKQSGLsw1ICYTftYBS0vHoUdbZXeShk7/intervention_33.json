I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket, but the brother insists on a full suit or not attending. The author is considering whether they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wedding is in the summer, and the author is concerned about being too hot without a jacket. They offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, but the brother is firm on the full suit. The author is conflicted between wanting to attend and not wanting to wear the jacket.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to wear the jacket. Let's consider cultural norms around weddings. Typically, weddings have specific dress codes. If it's a formal wedding, a suit and tie might be expected, but in summer, maybe something like a suit without the jacket is acceptable, especially if it's hot. The brother's insistence could be about tradition or respect for the occasion.\n\nThe author is offering a compromise (no jacket), but the brother is not budging. The author's reasoning is comfort and the weather. But maybe the brother feels that not wearing a jacket isn't formal enough. It's a family event, so the brother might be trying to maintain a certain standard for the day. However, the author isn't refusing to dress formally entirely; they just want to omit the jacket for comfort. \n\nAnother angle: The brother's fianc\u00e9e is terminally ill. The wedding is a significant event for them. The author might not want to cause conflict by not following the dress code. But the author's personal comfort is also valid. Is there a middle ground, like a lightweight jacket or breathable fabric? The author hasn't mentioned that option yet.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a reasonable request based on practical considerations (heat) and have offered to wear formal attire otherwise. The brother's stance is rigid, but the author isn't refusing to dress up. So the conflict is more about the brother's expectations versus the guest's comfort. In that case, the author isn't at fault. But maybe there's a cultural expectation I'm missing. However, in many summer weddings, suits without jackets are common in warm climates. So the author might be right to prioritize comfort, and the brother is being overly strict. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
