He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a family wedding where the brother is getting married to someone with terminal cancer. The poster is a sibling who wants to attend but doesn't want to wear a suit jacket due to the summer heat. The brother insists on a full suit or no attendance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural norms around weddings. Typically, weddings have expected dress codes. A summer wedding might suggest lighter attire, but some may still require formal wear. The poster's brother is strict about the suit jacket. But the poster has a valid reason: discomfort from the heat. They've already communicated their preference and are being denied. \n\nThe context of the brother's marriage adds complexity. The poster suspects the marriage is due to the fianc\u00e9's terminal illness, but they don't voice this. The brother's insistence on the suit could be seen as rigid. The poster's issue is about personal comfort versus family expectations. \n\nIs the poster being unreasonable? They're not refusing to attend; they just want to adjust their attire. The brother's stance might be about maintaining formality, but it's possible he's overreacting. The poster isn't causing harm by not wearing a jacket. The brother is making an ultimatum, which could be seen as overly strict. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's inflexibility and the poster's valid concern about comfort. The poster isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own comfort in a situation where the dress code might be negotiable, especially considering the summer setting. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
