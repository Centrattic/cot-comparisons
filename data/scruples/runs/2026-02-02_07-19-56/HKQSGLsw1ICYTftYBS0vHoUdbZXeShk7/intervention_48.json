He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the dress code. The brother insists on a full suit, but the author prefers to go without the jacket due to the summer heat. The brother's stance is firm: full suit or no attendance. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they want to be comfortable and have a valid reason (heat). They've already communicated their preference, and the brother is being inflexible. The brother's marriage situation is complicated, which might add stress, but the author's request seems reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is the host, so he might feel entitled to set the dress code. However, the situation is sensitive given the fianc\u00e9's illness. Maybe the brother is trying to make everything perfect for her, but insisting on a jacket in summer could be seen as unreasonable. Also, considering the author's attendance is a school day off, they might not want to miss out.\n\nThe key factors are the reasonableness of the request and the context. Wearing a suit jacket in summer is uncomfortable, especially in a reception that might be indoors without air conditioning. The brother's demand could be seen as overly strict, especially when the author is already dressed formally except for the jacket. \n\nIn many cultural contexts, formal attire for men can sometimes be a suit and tie without the jacket in warmer weather, especially in more relaxed settings. The brother's insistence might not be considering the comfort and practicality for guests. Additionally, the brother's personal situation (fresh divorce, terminal illness) might cloud his judgment here, leading to an inflexible stance.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason for their request, and the brother's refusal could be seen as unreasonable. The answer should be B.\n"
