He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for refusing to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The brother insisted on a full suit, but the person is uncomfortable with the jacket because it's a summer wedding and they'd be too hot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. In many cases, formal attire can include a suit and tie but sometimes the jacket is optional, especially in warmer weather. The person offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, which might be acceptable depending on the event's formality. However, the brother is being strict, possibly because of the event's significance or his own preferences.\n\nThe brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. The brother might feel the wedding is important and wants everything to be perfect, especially given the circumstances. The user is in a dilemma between respecting their brother's wishes and their own comfort.\n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong for not complying. Traditionally, weddings are formal events, and guests are expected to dress appropriately as requested. However, the author has a valid reason (heat) and has communicated their preference. The brother's stance seems inflexible. \n\nCultural context matters. In some cultures, a suit without a jacket is acceptable for summer events. The brother might be overreacting, especially if the wedding isn't in a very formal venue. Also, the author's reason is practical. The brother's insistence could be seen as unreasonable if the jacket is not necessary for the event's formality.\n\nThe user's motivation isn't disrespectful; they want to attend but are physically uncomfortable. The brother's demand to wear a full suit or not attend at all seems harsh. The author isn't refusing the event but is negotiating their attire. Considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their comfort when the alternative is not attending at all. So, the answer is B.\n"
