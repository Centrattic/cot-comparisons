He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a brother's wedding, and the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket in the summer heat. The brother is insistent that it's either a full suit or no attendance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is for the author's brother, who is marrying someone with terminal cancer. That adds emotional weight. The brother's stance is strict, which might be because he wants the event to feel formal or respectful given the circumstances. On the other hand, the author is uncomfortable with the suit jacket due to the heat and the season.\n\nThe author has already communicated their preference, but the brother won't budge. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Wearing a suit jacket in summer can be uncomfortable, and some people might choose not to for practical reasons. However, weddings often have dress codes, and the family might expect adherence to it, especially if it's a formal event.\n\nI need to evaluate cultural norms and the importance of the event. In many Western cultures, a summer wedding might still expect a suit and tie, but the jacket might be optional, especially in hot climates. The brother's insistence could be a mix of personal preference and wanting to honor the occasion. The author's refusal to compromise might be seen as disrespectful, but their reasoning is practical.\n\nHowever, considering the brother's fianc\u00e9's health, maybe the family is prioritizing comfort, but the brother is making a stand on attire. The author's position is about personal comfort versus the brother's expectations. The question is whether the author's stance is unreasonable. If the wedding is formal, then the author might be in the wrong for not complying. But if the dress code is flexible, maybe not. The brother's strictness could be an overreaction, but the author's refusal to attend rather than wear a jacket might be seen as prioritizing comfort over family, which could be frowned upon.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on cultural expectations and the importance of the event. If the author is in a culture where formal attire is strictly expected, then they might be in the wrong. If the wedding allows for some flexibility, then maybe not. But since the brother is insisting, and the author is choosing to not attend rather than comply, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not making an exception for such a significant and somber event.\n"
