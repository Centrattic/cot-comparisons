He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding when the brother insists on a full suit. The author is facing a conflict between their comfort and the expectations of the wedding. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wedding is in the summer, so maybe a full suit would indeed be uncomfortable due to the heat. The author has offered to wear formal attire without the jacket, which they think is the best compromise they can manage. However, the brother is firm, saying it's full suit or don't come. \n\nNow, the brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds an emotional layer. The author's brother is getting married again after a divorce, and there's a hint that the marriage might not be entirely for the right reasons, but the author isn't going to voice that. \n\nThe key points here are the cultural or family expectations around formalwear at weddings. In many cultures, weddings are formal events where guests are expected to dress appropriately, which often includes a suit and tie for men. However, in summer, some people might adjust by not wearing a jacket but keeping the tie and dress pants. The author's brother might be adhering to a strict dress code, perhaps due to family traditions or the importance he places on the event given the circumstances.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot because they want to be respectful but also comfortable. The brother's stance is firm, which could be seen as being rigid, especially if the author's request is reasonable. But is the author wrong for not complying?\n\nI should consider whether the author's request is reasonable. If the wedding is formal, the expectation of a full suit is standard. However, in hot weather, not wearing a jacket might be common. It's possible that the brother is overstepping by insisting on a full suit regardless of the weather. Alternatively, maybe the author is being inconsiderate by not following the dress code, which could be seen as disrespectful to the couple's wishes.\n\nAnother angle: The author is a guest, so their role is to attend and comply with reasonable requests. If the venue is indoor with air conditioning, maybe the brother is being overly strict. But if the ceremony is outdoors in summer, the author's discomfort is valid. The brother's insistence might be causing the author to feel like they're choosing between their comfort and attending the event.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if the dress code is too strict for the occasion. On the other hand, the brother might have a right to set the dress code for his wedding. But when a guest's personal comfort is at stake, and the compromise offered is acceptable in some social contexts, the responsibility isn't entirely on the guest.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of the event against personal comfort. Weddings are big events, but so are personal well-being and health. If the author is genuinely uncomfortable and the brother is not willing to compromise, maybe the author is justified in their stance.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a case for both sides, the brother's rigidity in a situation where the guest's comfort is a valid concern might make the author not entirely wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
