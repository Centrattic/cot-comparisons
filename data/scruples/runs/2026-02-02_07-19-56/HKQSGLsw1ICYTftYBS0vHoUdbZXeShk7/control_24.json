He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. I want to go to the wedding because it\u2019s a day off school and there\u2019d be a reception, but I don\u2019t want to wear a suit jacket. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to wear a suit jacket to a brother's wedding because it's a summer event and they'd be too hot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around wedding attire. In many Western weddings, men are expected to wear suits, sometimes with a tie but maybe not necessarily a jacket in summer. The author is willing to wear formal attire but without the jacket. Their brother is insisting on a full suit or no attendance. \n\nThe brother's fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer, which adds emotional weight. The brother is divorced, and the author suspects the marriage is due to the fianc\u00e9's illness, but they won't say that out loud. The author is conflicted between attending and comfort.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting the jacket? It depends on social expectations. Some might say the wedding is a formal event and the suit is required, but summer heat is a practical issue. Others might argue that respecting the couple's wishes is important, even if it's uncomfortable. However, the brother's ultimatum (suit or don't come) seems harsh. The author is compromising by offering to wear formal clothes without the jacket. Maybe the brother is overstepping, making the author not entirely in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
