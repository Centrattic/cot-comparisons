He\u2019s already been married once and is freshly divorced (privately I think he\u2019s getting the marriage purely because she\u2019s dying but I wouldn\u2019t dream of saying that to anybody involved).\n\nThey\u2019re planning for a summer wedding, and my problem is that I don\u2019t want to wear a full suit for a summer wedding. I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable. I\u2019ve said I\u2019m happy to attend in formal attire, *excluding a jacket*, and my brother maintains that it\u2019s either show up in a full suit or don\u2019t show up at all. \n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9 has terminal cancer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's brother is getting married, but the fianc\u00e9 is dying from brain cancer. The brother is recently divorced. The wedding is in the summer, and the author doesn't want to wear a full suit because of the heat. The brother insists on a full suit or no attendance. The author wants to attend but is conflicted about the jacket.\n\nSo, the main issue is the dress code. The author is being asked to wear a suit jacket in summer, which is hot. The brother is strict about the attire. The user is wondering if the author is wrong to not comply.\n\nI should consider cultural norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings have formal attire expectations, but they can vary. Summer weddings might have more lenient or different dress codes, like a \"summer suit\" or lighter options. However, some people might still expect full formalwear.\n\nThe brother's insistence could be about maintaining formality, but given the situation with the fianc\u00e9's illness, maybe he's trying to make the day as perfect as possible. On the other hand, the author's discomfort with the jacket due to the heat is a valid personal concern. Health and comfort matter, especially in hot weather.\n\nIs there a line between respecting the event and personal comfort? The author isn't refusing to attend; they just want to skip the jacket. The brother's response seems extreme\u2014banning attendance if they don't wear the jacket. That could be seen as unreasonable. Weddings are about celebrating, and being overly strict about attire might not be the best approach, especially under such circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is practical. They don't want to be uncomfortable. There's no mention of other options like a lighter jacket or a different suit. Maybe the brother is being inflexible. But maybe cultural expectations in their area are strict.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily wrong. They have a valid reason for not wanting the jacket. The brother's demand might be too rigid. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
