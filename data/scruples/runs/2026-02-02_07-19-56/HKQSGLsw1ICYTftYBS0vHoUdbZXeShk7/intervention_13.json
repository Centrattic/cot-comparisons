I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding, especially considering the fianc\u00e9 is dying. The brother is insisting on a full suit, but the author is uncomfortable with the jacket because of the summer heat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms around weddings. Traditionally, weddings often have a dress code, and suits are common for men. However, summer weddings can be more relaxed, and sometimes a suit without a jacket is acceptable, especially depending on the region and the formality of the event. The key here is whether the brother's insistence is reasonable.\n\nThe author mentions they're willing to wear formal attire but without the jacket. The brother, however, is taking a hard line, saying either wear the full suit or don't come. That's a bit extreme. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, and while respecting the couple's wishes is important, the brother's stance seems inflexible. It's possible he's trying to maintain a certain image or has personal reasons, but it's not fair to exclude someone from a family event over a dress code preference, especially when the person is making an effort to dress formally otherwise.\n\nAlso, the context of the fianc\u00e9's illness adds another layer. This is a bittersweet event, and the brother might be under a lot of stress. However, the author's discomfort is valid, especially in hot weather. There's a balance between respecting traditions and being considerate of personal comfort. The author isn't being disrespectful by not wanting to wear the jacket; they're seeking a practical solution. The brother's ultimatum seems overly strict, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to attend and make an effort but have a legitimate reason to ask for an exception. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
