      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a wedding where the author doesn't want to wear a suit jacket because they'll be too hot at a summer wedding. The brother insists on a full suit, otherwise, don't come.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around weddings. Usually, weddings have a dress code, and the guests are expected to follow it. If the wedding is formal, then a suit and tie is appropriate. However, in summer, maybe a suit without a jacket is acceptable, especially if it's hot. The author mentions they're okay with formal attire but without the jacket. \n\nBut the brother is being very strict, saying either full suit or don't come. The author is conflicted because they want to attend but don't want to be uncomfortable. The brother's fianc\u00e9 is terminally ill, which adds emotional weight. The author might feel pressure to attend, but also to be comfortable.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not. Weddings can have different dress codes. Sometimes it's a suit and tie, sometimes less formal. If the wedding is in summer, a suit jacket might be too hot. The author is being respectful by offering to attend in formal attire minus the jacket, which is a reasonable compromise. The brother's stance seems rigid. However, the brother is the one hosting, so he might have specific expectations. But is it fair to exclude someone over a dress code? It might depend on the cultural context. In some places, not wearing a jacket might be considered disrespectful, but in others, it's more relaxed. Since the author is willing to wear the pants and shirt, maybe the jacket isn't essential. The brother's insistence on the jacket could be about tradition or personal preference. The author's discomfort is valid, especially in hot weather. So maybe the brother is being unreasonable here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
