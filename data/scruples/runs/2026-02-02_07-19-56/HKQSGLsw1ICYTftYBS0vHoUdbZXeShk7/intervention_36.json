I\u2019d be too hot to be comfortable.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to wear a suit jacket to their brother's wedding. The situation involves the brother's fianc\u00e9 having terminal brain cancer, and the brother is insisting on a full suit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the usual etiquette around weddings. Traditionally, weddings expect formal attire, especially for close family. However, summer weddings can be more forgiving in terms of dress code to accommodate the heat. The author is okay with formal attire but wants to skip the jacket due to discomfort.\n\nThe brother's stance is strict: full suit or don't attend. That's a strong position. The user's brother might be under stress given his fianc\u00e9's illness, which could influence his strictness. However, the author is also trying to balance their own comfort and the family event's importance.\n\nIs there a cultural or situational factor I'm missing? In some cultures, formal attire is non-negotiable, but others might be more flexible. Since it's a summer wedding, the heat is a valid concern. The author isn't refusing to attend but is negotiating attire. The brother's insistence might come from a place of wanting things to be perfect despite the circumstances.\n\nBut is the author being unreasonable? Formal attire typically includes a suit and tie, but the jacket can sometimes be omitted in warmer weather. The brother might not be considering modern or situational dress codes. However, the author is willing to attend, just not in the full suit.\n\nThe user originally thought the author was in the wrong, but maybe the brother is being inflexible. The key is whether the author's request is reasonable. Given the context of summer heat and the brother's strictness, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a matter of balancing respect for the event with personal comfort. The brother's ultimatum might be excessive. So the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
