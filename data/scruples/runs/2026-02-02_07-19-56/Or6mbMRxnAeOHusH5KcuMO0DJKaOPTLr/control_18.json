We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. So, the situation is about referring to an ex who transitioned from female to male. The author called their ex \"ex-girlfriend\" because they were dating when the person was female.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective here. Transgender individuals often prefer to be recognized in their current gender identity. Even if the person transitioned after the relationship, the current name and pronouns should be respected. But the author is arguing that since the relationship happened when the person was female, it's technically accurate to refer to them as an ex-girlfriend.\n\nHowever, in the trans community, people often prefer that others use their current identity regardless of past relationships. The acquaintance's reaction might be based on that understanding. The key point here is whether the author should prioritize the past context or the current identity of their ex. The author's ex didn't seem offended, but the friend was. There's a conflict between factual accuracy and respecting the trans person's identity.\n\nI think the main issue is about respect and sensitivity. Even if the author's statement is technically accurate, it might be seen as not respecting the ex's current identity. Trans people often ask that others use their current names and pronouns to affirm their identity. So, even in past contexts, using the current identity might be preferred. However, some people might have different views, and the ex's lack of offense complicates things.\n\nBut the standard here is usually to respect the trans person's current identity. So, the author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" might be considered incorrect because Dan is now male, and the correct term would be \"ex-boyfriend\" to align with his current identity. The fact that the acquaintance was upset suggests that this is a common concern in the community. The answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because respecting the current identity is more important than the past context.\n"
