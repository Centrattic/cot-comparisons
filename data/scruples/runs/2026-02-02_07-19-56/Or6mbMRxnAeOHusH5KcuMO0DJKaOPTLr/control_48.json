We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a former relationship where their ex, Dan, was assigned female at birth but transitioned to male. The author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because he was a girl when they dated. The mutual friend got upset, saying Dan is their ex-boyfriend now, but Dan himself isn't offended.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the social and cultural norms around transgender identities. When someone transitions, their name and pronouns change, but how should past relationships be referred to? Some people might prioritize the person's current identity and use the appropriate pronouns and terms moving forward. However, others might consider the time when the relationship happened, using the names and pronouns from that period.\n\nThe key points here are: Dan transitioned after the relationship ended. The author is trying to explain the relationship by referencing the time when Dan was Kate. The friend is upset, but Dan isn't. This suggests that while the friend has an issue with the terminology, Dan himself doesn't mind. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider Dan's feelings and preferences. Since Dan isn't offended, the author might be within their rights to refer to the relationship as it was. However, using \"ex-girlfriend\" might not align with Dan's current identity, even if the relationship was in the past. Transgender individuals often appreciate being recognized with their current identity and pronouns. But if Dan is okay with the past reference, then the author's approach is acceptable.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting the person's current identity and acknowledging the history of the relationship. The friend's reaction is about correctness based on Dan's current identity, but if Dan himself is fine with the past reference, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The question is whether the author should prioritize the friend's opinion over Dan's comfort. Since Dan doesn't mind, the author isn't wrong for using that term in this context. The main issue might be the friend's misunderstanding or lack of awareness about trans issues.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're respecting Dan's past identity and he's not offended. The friend's reaction is based on a different perspective, but the author isn't violating Dan's wishes. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
