We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex, Dan (formerly Kate), their ex-girlfriend. The situation is that they dated when he was Kate, broke up, and then he transitioned. The author refers to him as ex-gf because that's how they were when they dated. But a mutual acquaintance was upset and said it should be ex-bf now.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider trans issues here. Trans people often want to be recognized in their current identity, especially regarding pronouns and past relationships. But the author's argument is that technically, when they were dating, he was a girl, so ex-gf makes sense. However, trans individuals might prefer that their past is referred to in a way that aligns with their current identity, even if that's not factually accurate. \n\nWait, but Dan didn't seem offended. The main conflict came from the acquaintance, not Dan himself. So maybe the issue is about respecting Dan's current identity versus the factual past. The author's point is that they're not gay, so using ex-gf is accurate because they were with a girl. But trans rights often emphasize that a person's current identity is their true identity, so referring to them with past pronouns/relationships might be seen as invalidating.\n\nBut since Dan isn't offended, does that matter? The author might be right in their reasoning, but maybe the acquaintance's reaction is about respecting Dan's transition. However, if Dan is okay with it, does the acquaintance have a right to yell at the author? Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're following Dan's preferences. But if the community standards or trans guidelines suggest otherwise, maybe the author should adjust their language even if Dan is okay with it.\n\nI need to think about the standard here. Typically, trans people prefer to be referred to by their current names and pronouns, and past relationships are often discussed in the context of their current identity. So even if the relationship happened when they were a different gender, referring to them in past gender labels might be considered transphobic. But if Dan is okay with it, perhaps the author isn't wrong because they're respecting Dan's wishes. However, the acquaintance's upset response might indicate that the broader trans community would see it as incorrect, regardless of Dan's feelings.\n\nSo the author's intent is to be accurate, but the standard might be that respecting current identity is more important. Even if Dan isn't offended, the acquaintance's reaction suggests that the author's statement could be harmful or disrespectful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not using language that aligns with Dan's current identity, even if Dan isn't upset. But if Dan is okay with it, maybe it's not the author's fault. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the general consensus in trans advocacy is to use current pronouns and avoid referencing past identities without the person's consent. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting the trans person's current identity, even if the person isn't offended. Alternatively, if the person is okay with it, then B (not in the wrong). But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is that the acquaintance was upset, but Dan wasn't. The author is following Dan's lead, but perhaps the broader community's expectations matter. Hmm. I'm a bit split here. Maybe the answer is B because the author isn't the one being transphobic; they're just stating a factual relationship. However, trans people often prefer that their relationships be acknowledged in their current identity. So if Dan is now male, even if the author is not gay, it's about how the relationship is framed now. So maybe A is the answer. But I'm not sure. Let me check some sources. Typically, when a trans person transitions, their relationships are referred to in the context of their current identity. So if Dan is now male, referring to the author's past relationship as ex-boyfriend would be appropriate, even if the relationship occurred when he was female. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting Dan's current identity. Hence, answer A.\n"
