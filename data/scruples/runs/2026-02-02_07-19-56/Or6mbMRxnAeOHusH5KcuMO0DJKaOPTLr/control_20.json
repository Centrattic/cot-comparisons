We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling their ex FtM partner \"ex-girlfriend.\" First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author dated someone who was assigned female at birth (Kate) and later transitioned to male (Dan). They broke up before the transition. Now, the author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because during their relationship, he was still Kate. But the mutual acquaintance is upset, saying he's the ex-boyfriend now. Dan himself isn't offended.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and terminology. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current names and pronouns, and their gender identity. Even if the relationship happened before transition, the person's gender identity is now male. So, using \"ex-girlfriend\" might not align with Dan's current identity. However, the author's reasoning is that the relationship was during when Dan was Kate, so the term is factually accurate.\n\nBut transgender individuals typically want to be recognized in their current gender. Using past labels might be seen as invalidating their identity. The author might not be intending harm, but the term \"ex-girlfriend\" could be considered transphobic because it focuses on the past gender rather than the current one. Even if Dan isn't offended, the acquaintance's reaction suggests that the term can be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, if Dan isn't upset, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the broader context is that the correct approach is to respect the current identity. So the author's use of the term, while perhaps factually accurate in a technical sense, might be considered disrespectful in a social context. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
