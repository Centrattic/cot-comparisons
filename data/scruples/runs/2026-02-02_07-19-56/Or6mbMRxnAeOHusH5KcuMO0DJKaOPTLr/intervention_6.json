We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for calling their FtM (female-to-male) ex-girlfriend their ex-girlfriend. The situation is that the author dated someone who was assigned female at birth and transitioned to male after they broke up. The author is non-gay, and when they were dating, the person was still presenting as female. The author's friend corrected them, saying the ex should be referred to as an ex-boyfriend now, but the author argues that since during the relationship the ex was a woman, it's accurate to call them an ex-girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social and trans rights perspectives here. Trans individuals often emphasize being referred to by their current names and pronouns. However, the question here is about the past relationship and how to refer to it. \n\nIn many trans communities, people are advised to use the name and gender they were known by during the time of the relationship. So if Dan was known as Kate and presented as female during the relationship, it's appropriate to refer to the past relationship as being with a girlfriend. The key here is that the person's gender identity and presentation at the time of the relationship are what matter for that context. \n\nThe acquaintance's reaction seems to be based on a different understanding, possibly not considering the trans person's history. The author isn't misgendering Dan now; they're accurately reflecting the past. Since Dan himself didn't seem offended, it's more about the author's right to describe their past relationship as it was. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're accurately describing the past relationship as it existed. The acquaintance's correction might be well-intentioned but misunderstands the nuance of trans individuals' past identities. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
