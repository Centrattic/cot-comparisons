We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend after their transition.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dated someone who was assigned female at birth (Kate) and then transitioned to male (Dan). The author is not gay, so they might feel more comfortable using \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how they remember the relationship. However, the ex is now male, and the acquaintance insists on \"ex-boyfriend.\"\n\nI should consider transgender respect. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current identity. Even if the relationship started under a different name, using their former name or old pronouns can be hurtful. Dan transitioned, so he probably wants to be recognized as male now. The author is using his former identity, which might not align with his current self-identification.\n\nThe acquaintance was upset, possibly because the author isn't respecting Dan's transition. The fact that Dan didn't object but left might mean he's uncomfortable but doesn't want to confront. The author's justification is that during the relationship, Dan was Kate. But in terms of trans rights, the current identity is what matters. The author's reasoning might be factually accurate in terms of past events but could be harmful if it doesn't respect the person's current identity.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not be aware of the nuances. However, the acquaintance's reaction suggests that the term is inappropriate. Even if Dan isn't offended, the correct approach is to use the person's current name and pronouns. The author should ask Dan how he wants to be referred to, rather than assuming.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're using outdated terms that don't align with Dan's current identity, which can be disrespectful. The correct answer is A.\n"
