We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is wrong for calling their FtM ex a \"girlfriend.\" The situation involves a trans man who transitioned after the relationship ended. The author refers to their ex as an ex-girlfriend because, during the relationship, the person was living as a woman. The mutual acquaintance is upset, arguing that the ex is now male, so the correct term should be ex-boyfriend. However, the ex (Dan) doesn't seem offended, which complicates things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the trans community's guidelines. Generally, people are advised to use the name and pronouns that the individual currently identifies with. But there's also a concept called \"deadnaming,\" where using a former name or incorrect pronouns can be hurtful. However, in this case, the author isn't deadnaming Dan; they're referring to the relationship's context when Dan was living as Kate. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's statement is factually accurate and respectful. The author explains that when they were dating, Dan was still Kate. So, technically, the author's statement is factually correct. Dan isn't offended, which suggests that he's comfortable with the reference. The mutual acquaintance is upset, possibly due to a misunderstanding or not considering Dan's past identity.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. Even if the statement is factually accurate, it might not take into account Dan's current identity preferences. Some trans people might prefer not to be referred to by their past relationships in terms of gender. However, since Dan didn't object, it's possible he's okay with it. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they are not gay, so using \"girlfriend\" aligns with their experience. This part is a bit tricky because the author is making an assumption about their own identity based on the gender they were dating at the time. However, that's their personal perspective.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main issue is whether the author is respecting Dan's current identity. Since Dan isn't offended, the author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" might be acceptable. The mutual acquaintance's reaction might stem from a lack of understanding about trans issues. The author isn't in the wrong if Dan is okay with it. However, if the author were to continue using that term in a way that disregards Dan's current identity, that could be problematic. But in this specific instance, since Dan didn't object and the statement is factually accurate regarding the relationship's timeline, the author isn't necessarily at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
