We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for referring to their FtM ex as an ex-girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author (let's call them Person A) dated Dan, who was transitioning from female to male. They were in a relationship when Dan was identifying as a girl (Kate). After they broke up, Dan transitioned. Now, in a class setting, Person A refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because that's how they were during the relationship. A mutual friend corrects them, saying Dan is now their ex-boyfriend, which causes some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. From Person A's view, they're being factual about the relationship's history. Dan was a girl when they dated, so calling them an ex-girlfriend makes sense. However, Dan himself might now identify as male, so how others refer to them could affect their identity.\n\nTransgender individuals often emphasize the importance of using the name and pronouns they currently identify with. So even though Person A is technically correct about the past, using past labels might be seen as misgendering Dan. But the user says Dan didn't seem offended, which complicates things. The mutual acquaintance was the one who got upset, possibly on Dan's behalf or due to their own understanding of trans issues.\n\nI should think about the principle of respecting someone's current identity versus the historical context. Even if the past is accurate, the present is where the relationship exists now. People might argue that referring to Dan as a girl now, after he has transitioned, could be hurtful or disregard his identity. On the other hand, Person A might not be aware of the sensitivity around this issue and is just trying to be truthful about the past.\n\nAnother angle is the mutual friend's reaction. They might be advocating for Dan's current identity, which is valid. But why was the friend so upset if Dan himself wasn't? Maybe Dan is comfortable with Person A using the old label, but the friend sees it as a transgression regardless. It's possible that the friend is projecting their own views, or maybe Dan is more accepting than others would be.\n\nAlso, the term \"ex-girlfriend\" could be confusing for others. It might imply that Dan was a woman then and is now a man, which is accurate, but could lead to discussions about trans issues that others aren't ready for. However, in the context of a mutual friend who didn't know they were dating, the explanation might be necessary but handled in a way that respects Dan's current identity.\n\nI recall that in many cases, the current name and pronouns are preferred, even when discussing past relationships. Using past names or labels might be seen as invalidating the person's current identity. But if the person themselves is okay with it, does that matter? It's a bit of a balancing act between respecting the individual's preferences and societal norms.\n\nSo, is Person A in the wrong? If Dan isn't offended, maybe they aren't. But if the standard is to use current pronouns even when referring to past relationships, then they might be. The key here is whether Dan's current identity is being respected by how others refer to them. Since Dan didn't seem upset, maybe Person A is in the right. However, if the mutual friend is acting on behalf of trans rights, then Person A might be in the wrong for not using Dan's current identity in the context of the relationship now.\n\nBut then again, the relationship's nature changed. They are exes from a past relationship where Dan was a different gender. The term \"ex-girlfriend\" refers to the relationship's history. However, in contemporary usage, people often prefer to use the current identity even when discussing past relationships. For example, if someone transitions, people might refer to them using their current name and gender, even when talking about the past. So, using \"ex-girlfriend\" might not align with that.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether respecting current identity overrides the historical context. If society's expectations now are to prioritize current identity, then the author is in the wrong. If historical accuracy is also important and the trans person is okay with it, then maybe not. Since Dan wasn't offended, maybe the author is not wrong, but the mutual friend's reaction is based on their own beliefs. However, the author's perspective is that they're being factual. But in trans communities, misgendering (even in the past) can be seen as problematic because it emphasizes the past rather than the present identity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're using a label that doesn't reflect Dan's current identity. Even if Dan isn't upset, the mutual friend's reaction suggests that others might view it as incorrect. But I'm a bit conflicted because Dan's own feelings are more important. Since Dan didn't seem offended, maybe the author is okay. But the mutual friend's reaction could be a sign that the community norms are against using past labels. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the standard is to use current identity terms, regardless of past accuracy.\n"
