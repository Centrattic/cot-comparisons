  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for calling my FtM ex my ex-girlfriend?\nSo, there's this FtM guy I used to date when he, let's call him Dan, was still she, let's call her Kate. We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend, now transitioning as FtM, their ex-girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dated someone before they transitioned, so at the time they were a girl. Now that person is transitioning as FtM. The author refers to them as an ex-girlfriend because that's how they were when they were dating. But the mutual acquaintance corrects them, saying it should be ex-boyfriend now.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and how to refer to someone's past relationships. The author is trying to be factually accurate based on the time they were together. However, the acquaintance is upset and insists on the current gender identity. The person in question (Dan) doesn't seem offended, which is important. \n\nI should consider trans rights and the importance of respecting someone's current identity versus the past. Even if Dan is comfortable with being called ex-girlfriend, the acquaintance's reaction suggests there's a social norm to follow here. But the author is trying to be accurate about the past relationship. \n\nHowever, even if the author is factually correct, maybe they're not considering that the person's identity is now male, so referring to them as a girlfriend might not align with their current self-identification. But since Dan isn't offended, maybe it's okay. The author isn't using the wrong name or pronouns; they're just referring to the past relationship. \n\nBut the problem is the acquaintance's reaction. The author's answer might be seen as invalidating Dan's current identity. Even if it's true that they were a girlfriend back then, maybe the correct term now is to refer to them as a boyfriend, acknowledging their current identity. This is a common issue where people's past relationships may be referenced in ways that don't align with their current identity, potentially causing discomfort.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the current identity in how they frame past relationships, even if the facts are correct. The correct approach would be to refer to them as an ex-boyfriend now, regardless of past circumstances, to respect their current gender identity. The fact that Dan didn't object could mean he's comfortable, but the social context here requires sensitivity to how others perceive it.\n"
