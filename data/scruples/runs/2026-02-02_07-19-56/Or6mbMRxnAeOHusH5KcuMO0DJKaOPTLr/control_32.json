We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex a \"girlfriend.\" The situation involves a transition from female to male (FtM), so the ex used to be a woman (Kate) when they dated, and now is a man (Dan). The author's rationale is that since they were in a relationship when Dan was a girl, it's accurate to refer to them as an ex-girlfriend. However, the mutual acquaintance insists it should be ex-boyfriend now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social and personal implications of using past or present pronouns. Transitioning individuals often prefer to be recognized with their current identity, including pronouns and names. The key here is whether the term \"ex-girlfriend\" is appropriate. The author is using \"ex-gf\" as a factual statement based on the time they were in a relationship. But from a modern perspective, especially regarding trans rights, it's important to respect the person's current identity. Even if the relationship was in the past, using the term that aligns with their current gender might be more respectful.\n\nDan didn't seem offended, which suggests that he might be okay with the author's use of the term. However, the acquaintance's strong reaction implies that there's a social expectation to use the current relationship label. The author's explanation is logical, but it might overlook the importance of respecting Dan's transition. The term \"ex-boyfriend\" could be more affirming for Dan's current identity, even if the relationship was in the past. The author might not be intentionally disrespectful, but using the past label could cause discomfort or invalidate Dan's current identity. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention is to be factually accurate, the correct approach in such cases is to prioritize the individual's current identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not using the present label that Dan might prefer now, regardless of the past context.\n"
