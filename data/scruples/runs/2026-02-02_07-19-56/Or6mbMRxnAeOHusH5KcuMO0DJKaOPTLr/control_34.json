We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (now FtM) as \"ex-girlfriend.\" The situation involves a transition from female to male, so the person used to be a girl when they dated.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning is that when they were dating, the person was a girl, so calling them ex-girlfriend is factually accurate. The acquaintance, however, argues that the person is now a man, so the correct term is ex-boyfriend. The author mentions that Dan didn't seem offended, which complicates things.\n\nI need to consider trans rights here. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current gender identity. So even though Dan was a girl when they were in a relationship, using the current gender identity might be more respectful. The author might be using their past identity, but the focus should be on respecting the person's current identity.\n\nBut the author is nonbinary and not gay, but that's not directly relevant here. The key is how the trans person feels about being referred to. Since Dan didn't seem offended, maybe the author's approach is okay. However, the acquaintance is upset, which could indicate that in the social context, using the current identity is expected. Trans individuals might prefer to be acknowledged in their current state, regardless of past relationships.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the standard is to respect the person's current identity. Even if Dan isn't offended, the broader trans community might consider using their current identity as correct. The acquaintance's reaction could be based on that understanding. Therefore, the author's choice of words, while factually accurate in the past, might not align with the present identity, leading to the wrong in terms of respecting trans rights.\n"
