We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their ex, who is transitioning from female to male, their ex-girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex because the person was female when they dated, but later transitioned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's identity and how they want to be addressed. In many cases, trans individuals prefer to be referred to by their current name and pronouns. So even though they were female at the time of the relationship, once they transition and start living as male, others should use their current identity. The author is using the past identity, which might not be appropriate now.\n\nThe key here is whether using the past name and pronouns is respectful. Even if Dan isn't offended, the acquaintance was, which suggests that there's a social norm here. The author might be unintentionally invalidating Dan's transition by keeping him in the past. This could be seen as a form of deadnaming, which is generally considered disrespectful to trans people. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to explain the context of their past relationship. But maybe there's a better way to phrase it without using the past gender label. For example, saying \"I used to date Dan when he was transitioning\" or focusing on the name rather than the gender. \n\nThe fact that Dan didn't confront the author but the acquaintance did might indicate that Dan is more accepting, but the acquaintance's reaction is still valid. The author's approach could be seen as not respecting Dan's current identity, even if it's technically accurate. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong here because they're not using Dan's current identity, which is important for his self-identity. Even if the facts are correct, the social aspect is about respecting the person's current self. Therefore, answer A (Yes) seems appropriate.\n"
