We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for referring to their FtM ex as their ex-girlfriend. The situation is that the author dated the person when they were identifying as female (Kate), then the person transitioned to male (Dan). The author uses \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how they were during the relationship. The mutual acquaintance is upset, saying Dan is their ex-boyfriend now.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both the trans person's perspective and the social norms. Transitioning individuals often have their lived experience respected, so if Dan identifies as male now, others should use his current identity. But the author is confused because the relationship happened when he was female. \n\nThe key here is respecting Dan's identity. Even though the relationship was past, using past pronouns and labels might not be appropriate. Trans people often prefer people to use their current names and pronouns. However, the author is trying to clarify the past context by using the past identity. But maybe that's not the right approach because it's focusing on the past identity rather than respecting the present one. \n\nThe acquaintance might be right in pointing out that using \"ex-girlfriend\" could be invalidating. Even if Dan isn't offended, the main issue is about respecting Dan's current identity. The author's explanation about the past might be well-intentioned, but the correct approach is to align with Dan's current identity moving forward. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because they're using a label that doesn't reflect Dan's current identity, even if it was accurate in the past. The right thing would be to refer to Dan as a male now, even when discussing the past relationship, perhaps by specifying \"back when Dan identified as female.\" But using \"ex-girlfriend\" is outdated. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
