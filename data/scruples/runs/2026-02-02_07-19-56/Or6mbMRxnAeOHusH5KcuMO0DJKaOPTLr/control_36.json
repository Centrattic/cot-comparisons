We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for referring to their ex as \"ex-girlfriend\" when the person transitioned after the relationship. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author dated someone who was assigned female at birth (Kate) but later transitioned to male (Dan). The relationship ended before the transition. The author refers to Dan as their \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's what he was during the relationship. However, a mutual acquaintance gets upset and insists it should be \"ex-boyfriend.\" The key here is the terminology and how it's perceived by others, especially the trans person involved.\n\nNow, considering trans rights and respect. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current gender identity, not by past labels. So, even if the relationship happened when the person was living as a different gender, using the past label (like ex-girlfriend) might not align with the person's current identity. However, some might argue that since the relationship was in the past, using past pronouns or labels is okay if that's how it was at the time.\n\nBut the main point here is that the mutual acquaintance was upset. The author says Dan didn't seem offended, but the acquaintance was. However, the author should probably prioritize Dan's feelings over the acquaintance's. Even if Dan isn't directly offended, the way the author phrased it in front of others might be problematic. Trans individuals often ask others to use their current names and pronouns to affirm their identity. Using past labels could be seen as invalidating their current identity, especially in public.\n\nAlso, the term \"ex-girlfriend\" might imply that the relationship is in the past, but the person is now a man. While technically accurate, it's more about respecting how the trans person wants to be addressed. The author's justification is that it's factual, but in many cases, respecting the person's current identity is more important than technical accuracy.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong here because using past labels without considering the trans person's current identity can be hurtful or disrespectful. Even if the ex (Dan) didn't react, the situation shows that the acquaintance was upset, which might indicate that the author should be more sensitive. The right approach would be to use the current name and pronouns, regardless of the past relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
