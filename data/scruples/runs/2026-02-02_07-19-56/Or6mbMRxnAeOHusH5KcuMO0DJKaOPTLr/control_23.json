We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex a \"girlfriend.\" So, the situation is that they dated someone who was assigned female at birth and was transitioning to male. The person transitioned after they broke up. The author refers to them as their ex-girlfriend because during the time they dated, the person was still living as a woman. However, a mutual acquaintance got upset and said they should be called an ex-boyfriend instead.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about respect for the person's identity and how others perceive the relationship. The author's reasoning is that since they were in a relationship when the person was still Kate (female), it's accurate to call them an ex-girlfriend. However, the acquaintance argued that since the person is now transitioning and identifying as male, the correct term is ex-boyfriend.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's point of view, they are sticking to the facts of the relationship as it existed at the time. On the other hand, the transitioning individual's current identity is as a man, so some might argue that using the past label (girlfriend) could be seen as invalidating their current identity. However, the author mentions that Dan didn't seem offended, which is important. The main conflict here is between the acquaintance's reaction and the author's perspective.\n\nIn terms of trans respect, it's generally considered important to use the name and pronouns that the person currently uses. But when referring to past relationships, there's some debate. Some people might find it appropriate to refer to the relationship as it was, while others might prefer to use the current terms to acknowledge their identity. Since Dan didn't express any offense, it's possible that the author was correct in how they referred to the relationship. The acquaintance's strong reaction might be due to their own understanding or sensitivity around the issue, not necessarily the author's wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the author's action might not be in the wrong here because they were being truthful about the past relationship and their ex didn't take offense. The acquaintance's upset reaction is their own, and the author's explanation seems valid from their perspective. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
