We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (who is now transitioning from female to male) as \"ex-girlfriend.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author used to date someone named Kate, who is now Dan after transitioning. They broke up before Dan transitioned, and now the author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because that's how they were when they dated. The issue arises when a mutual acquaintance gets upset about the term used.\n\nSo, the main question is about the appropriateness of using the term \"ex-girlfriend\" for someone who is now male. The author's argument is that technically, during the time they were dating, Dan was female, so it's factually accurate. However, the acquaintance argues that Dan is now male, hence \"ex-boyfriend\" is correct.\n\nI need to consider trans issues here. Transitioning individuals often prefer to be recognized by their current gender identity. Using the past female pronouns or titles might be seen as misgendering them, even if the context is about the past. It's possible that even though Dan isn't offended, others might feel it's insensitive. The acquaintance's reaction suggests that using \"ex-girlfriend\" is not appropriate now that Dan is transitioning.\n\nBut the author says Dan himself isn't offended. That complicates things. If Dan is okay with it, maybe the author isn't wrong. However, the key point is that the acquaintance was offended. The author might not have considered that others might find it disrespectful, regardless of Dan's feelings. \n\nAlso, respecting someone's current identity is important. Even if the relationship ended in the past, referring to them with their past gender could be seen as invalidating their current identity. It's possible that the author is unintentionally causing discomfort by not acknowledging Dan's transition, even in past contexts.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to accurately describe the relationship's timeline. The term \"ex-girlfriend\" could be factually correct in that specific historical context. But in modern usage, especially when discussing someone who is now male, using the past term might be confusing or hurtful, regardless of the facts.\n\nThere's a balance between accuracy and sensitivity. The author might not be in the wrong if they are sticking to the facts, but they might be missing the social nuance of respecting Dan's current identity. The acquaintance's reaction points to the fact that even if Dan isn't upset, others might be. So the author's statement could be seen as inadvertently transphobic, even if not intended.\n\nTherefore, even if the author's intention was to be truthful about the past, the effect might have been harmful. The correct approach would be to ask Dan how he wants to be referred to in such contexts and follow his preference. Since the author didn't mention discussing this with Dan, they might be in the wrong for not considering his current identity in the present conversation.\n"
