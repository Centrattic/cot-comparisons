  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for calling my FtM ex my ex-girlfriend?\nSo, there's this FtM guy I used to date when he, let's call him Dan, was still she, let's call her Kate. We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend after the person transitioned.\n\nFirst, the author dated someone who was assigned female at birth (FtM). They used the name Kate when they were dating, and after breaking up, the person transitioned and became Dan. The author refers to Dan as an ex-girlfriend because that's what they were during the relationship. \n\nThe main issue here is about how to refer to a trans person post-transition. The author is technically correct in a factual sense because during the relationship, the person was female. However, the acquaintance is upset because they believe Dan is now a man, so the correct term should be ex-boyfriend. Dan himself isn't offended, but the acquaintance is. \n\nI need to consider gender identity and pronouns. Trans individuals often prefer to be referred to by their current identity. While the author is recounting past facts, the way they phrase it might inadvertently ignore Dan's current identity. Even if Dan isn't offended, the way the author explained it in front of the acquaintance could be seen as invalidating Dan's transition. \n\nThe key point is whether using past terms respects the person's current identity. The author might not be malicious, but the statement could be problematic. The acquaintance's reaction suggests that the community's standards might lean towards using the current name and gender. So, while the author's intent was factual, the impact could be hurtful. \n\nHowever, Dan isn't offended, which complicates things. The author isn't in the wrong if Dan is okay with it. But the problem arises when the author explains their rationale in a way that justifies using past terms, which might dismiss the trans community's norms. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily wrong if Dan is fine with it, but the explanation given could be insensitive. The answer hinges on respecting the individual's current identity, and since Dan isn't upset, the author isn't in the wrong. But the way the explanation was given might be. However, the question is about being in the wrong, and since Dan isn't offended, the answer is B.\n"
