We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (now a trans man) their \"ex-girlfriend.\" So first, I need to understand the dynamics here.\n\nThe user dated someone when they were female (Kate), and that person later transitioned to male (Dan). The user refers to them as an ex-girlfriend because that's how they were when they were in the relationship. The issue arises when a mutual acquaintance corrects the user, saying that Dan is now a guy, so the user should call them an ex-boyfriend. The user argues that since the relationship happened when Dan was Kate, it's factually accurate to use \"ex-girlfriend.\" Dan himself isn't offended, but the friend is.\n\nI need to consider trans rights and the importance of pronouns and names. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current identity. However, the user is talking about their past relationship. There's a balance here between respecting the person's current identity and the historical context. \n\nIn some cases, using past labels might be seen as invalidating the person's current identity. For example, if someone transitions, they might prefer others to acknowledge their journey by using their current name and pronouns, even when discussing the past. But the user is using the correct name (Dan) and referring to the past relationship. The user isn't misgendering Dan; they're just using the term based on the past. \n\nDan isn't offended, which is a key point. That suggests that, at least from Dan's perspective, the user isn't wrong. The mutual friend, however, is offended. That could be because the friend believes that the user should refer to Dan in his current identity, even when discussing past relationships. \n\nThe user's rationale is that the relationship was with a female, so the term is factually accurate. But the friend's reaction is about respecting Dan's current identity. This is a sensitive area. The user might not be in the wrong because they are using the correct name and the term is factually accurate. However, the friend's perspective is also valid, as trans individuals often want to be seen as their current self, not as their past.\n\nBut since Dan himself isn't offended, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. The key here is that the user is using Dan's current name and the correct pronouns (he/him) when referring to him now. The term \"ex-girlfriend\" refers to the past, which is a factual statement. The issue is whether the user's use of the term is disrespectful. Since Dan isn't upset, and the user is clear in their explanation, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. However, the friend's reaction is also valid, but that doesn't necessarily make the user wrong.\n\nI think the correct answer is B (No), the user isn't in the wrong. They're using the correct current name and the term accurately reflects the past relationship. Since Dan isn't offended, the user's actions are respectful. The friend's issue is with the term, but the user's explanation makes sense and is factually accurate.\n"
