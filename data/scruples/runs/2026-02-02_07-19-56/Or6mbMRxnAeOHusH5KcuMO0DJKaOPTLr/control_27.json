We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for referring to their ex as \"ex-girlfriend\" when the ex transitioned from female to male after the relationship ended.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dated Dan when he was Kate (female), but after they broke up, Dan transitioned. Now, the author is uncertain about how to refer to Dan. The author says \"ex-girlfriend\" because during the relationship, Dan was female. However, a mutual acquaintance corrects them, saying Dan should be called \"ex-boyfriend.\" The author argues that since Dan was female during the relationship, it's accurate to say \"ex-girlfriend,\" and Dan himself doesn't seem offended. The acquaintance was upset, though.\n\nI need to consider the social and cultural nuances here. Transgender individuals often prefer to be referred to by the names and pronouns they currently identify with. Even if the relationship occurred before transition, some people might prefer to be recognized as their current gender. However, others might feel that the relationship should be acknowledged in the context of how it was at the time.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) What is the correct way to refer to a past relationship where the person has transitioned? 2) Is the author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" appropriate or offensive? 3) The reaction of the acquaintance and Dan's own response.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since Dan was female during the relationship, \"ex-girlfriend\" is factually accurate. However, the acquaintance argues that since Dan is now male, it should be \"ex-boyfriend.\" Dan didn't show any signs of being offended, which complicates things.\n\nIn many cases, it's considered respectful to use the name and pronouns the person currently uses, even if the relationship was in the past. But this can vary depending on the individual's preferences. However, the author is not using Dan's current name or pronouns in the reference\u2014they're using the past identity. This might be where the issue lies. If Dan is now male and uses male pronouns, referring to him in the past as a female might not align with his current identity, even if it was accurate at the time.\n\nBut the author also mentions that Dan didn't seem offended. So if the person themselves isn't bothered, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the acquaintance's strong reaction suggests there's a social norm or expectation that the author is violating. The author might be ignoring the current identity of the person, which could be seen as misgendering them, even in the past context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out the factual timeline\u2014Dan was female during the relationship. So if the author is stating a fact (that during the time of the relationship, Dan was a woman), maybe that's not inherently wrong. But the way it's phrased could come off as invalidating Dan's current identity. For example, saying \"he used to be my girlfriend when he was a girl\" might imply that Dan is now not a woman, which could be awkward or hurtful.\n\nThe key here is whether it's acceptable to refer to past relationships using the person's former gender identity. Some trans individuals appreciate being acknowledged in how they were in the past, while others prefer to have their current identity recognized even in past contexts. Since Dan didn't react negatively, maybe the author is okay. But the acquaintance's reaction suggests that the social norm in their community or context expects using current gender identity for past relationships.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about intent and impact. The author's intent was to be factually accurate, but the impact might be causing discomfort or misgendering. Even if Dan isn't offended, the acquaintance's reaction and the potential for causing discomfort to others (or Dan in the future) might mean the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, if Dan is okay with it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should respect Dan's current identity when referring to the past relationship. The general consensus in many transgender communities is to use the current name and pronouns, even when discussing past relationships. However, there's also a recognition that past relationships can be referenced in the context of the time. The line is blurry here. Since the author is using the past identity, but the current identity is important, the author might be seen as not respecting Dan's current identity, hence in the wrong. But since Dan isn't offended, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the acquaintance's reaction suggests that in that social context, the author's phrasing was problematic. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the correct approach is to respect the current identity, even when referencing the past."
