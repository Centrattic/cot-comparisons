We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (now transitioning as FtM) an ex-girlfriend instead of an ex-boyfriend.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The person, let's say they're the author, dated someone who was presenting as female (Kate) when they were together. After the relationship ended, Kate started transitioning as a trans man, becoming Dan. The author refers to Dan as an ex-girlfriend because that's how he was when they were dating. However, a mutual acquaintance gets upset, saying that Dan is now a guy, so the correct term should be ex-boyfriend.\n\nThe author argues that since Dan was a woman when they were in a relationship, calling him ex-girlfriend is factually accurate. Dan himself isn't offended. The question is whether the author is wrong for using that term.\n\nHmm. Transgender issues can be complex. The key point here is respecting how the person identifies now versus how they were during the relationship. The author is using the term based on Dan's past identity, but the acquaintance argues that now Dan is a man, so the term should reflect his current gender.\n\nWait, but in the trans community, it's important to use the name and pronouns that align with their current identity. However, the author is referring to the relationship in the past context. For example, if someone was a woman in the past and transitioned, when talking about the past relationship, using the past terms might be acceptable. But if the person now identifies as male, others might expect using male terms even when referring to the past, if the relationship is acknowledged with the current identity.\n\nBut the author is saying that during the relationship, the person was a woman, so ex-girlfriend is correct. Dan isn't offended, but the acquaintance is. The author is also stating that they aren't gay, which might be part of their reasoning for using ex-girlfriend.\n\nI think it's important to consider both perspectives. The author is being factually accurate about the past, but the acquaintance might be thinking that using the current identity's terms is more respectful. However, since Dan himself isn't offended, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance in how the community views such situations. \n\nIn some cases, trans individuals prefer their current identity to be used even when discussing the past. But if the person is comfortable with being referred to by their past identity in the context of the past relationship, then it's okay. Since Dan didn't seem offended, maybe the author is correct in using ex-girlfriend. But the acquaintance's reaction might stem from wanting to avoid misgendering Dan in any context. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to be accurate based on the past relationship. However, in trans communities, using current terms might be more appropriate. But since Dan isn't upset, maybe the author is okay. But maybe there's a cultural aspect here where it's better to use current terms to affirm the person's identity. \n\nI'm a bit conflicted. The answer might depend on whether the term is about the relationship's nature (girlfriend) or the person's gender at that time. Since the relationship was with Kate, a female, calling her ex-girlfriend makes sense. However, if the person now identifies as male, others might prefer he be referred to as a boyfriend in any context. But if the person is okay with it, then it's their choice. \n\nIn conclusion, since Dan isn't offended and the author is factually correct about the past, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But it's a sensitive area, and the acquaintance's reaction might be due to not understanding that. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I should check if there's a standard in the trans community about this.\n"
