We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend, who is now transmasculine, as \"ex-gf.\" The situation involves some nuances around identity and language.\n\nFirst, the author dated someone (Kate) who later transitioned (Dan). The author uses \"ex-girlfriend\" because during the relationship, the person was female. The friend corrected them, saying Dan is now a guy, hence \"ex-boyfriend.\" The author argues that since Dan wasn't male during the relationship, using \"ex-gf\" is factually accurate. Dan didn't seem offended, but the friend was upset.\n\nFrom a trans-inclusive perspective, respecting someone's current identity is crucial. Even if the relationship occurred in the past when the person was a different gender, using the current pronouns and labels is important. The friend's reaction might stem from wanting to respect Dan's identity, not just the factual accuracy of the relationship's timeline. While the author's intention wasn't to harm, the key point is about respecting Dan's current identity. So, the author might be in the wrong because using the past gender label could invalidate Dan's current identity. However, since Dan didn't object, there's a nuance. But the friend's correction might be valid in advocating for trans rights. The answer depends on prioritizing current identity over past circumstances. So, the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because using the past label could be seen as not respecting Dan's current identity, even if the author meant no harm.\n"
