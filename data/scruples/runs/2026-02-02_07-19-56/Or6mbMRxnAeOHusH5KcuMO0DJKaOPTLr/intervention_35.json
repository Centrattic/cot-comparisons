We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex a girlfriend. The situation is that they dated when the person was identifying as female (Kate) and later transitioned to male (Dan). The person is now unsure whether to refer to them as ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze this. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the person is using the term \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's what the relationship was at the time. They argue that since Dan was presenting as female then, it's factually accurate. But the key point here is about respecting the person's current identity. \n\nTransgender individuals often prefer to be referred to by the names and pronouns they currently use, even if that means acknowledging their past identity. So, when talking about a past relationship, it's important to consider the trans person's current identity. \n\nThe acquaintance was offended because they believe Dan is now male, so the correct term would be ex-boyfriend. The author might not be aware of the social norms here. Even though the author's ex doesn't seem offended, the main issue is about how the community perceives and respects the trans person's identity. \n\nIn many cases, the correct approach is to use the name and pronouns the person uses now. However, when referring to past relationships, some people might still use the name and pronouns from when they were in that relationship. But the key is to ask the trans person how they want to be referred to in such contexts. \n\nThe author didn't ask Dan how he wants to be referred to in this situation. They just assumed it was okay. Even though Dan didn't show offense, the acquaintance's reaction suggests that there's a social expectation to use the current identity. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the social norms around transgender identity and not checking with Dan first. The right approach would be to respect the current name and pronouns, even when discussing past relationships. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the current identity of their ex, leading to discomfort for others.\n"
