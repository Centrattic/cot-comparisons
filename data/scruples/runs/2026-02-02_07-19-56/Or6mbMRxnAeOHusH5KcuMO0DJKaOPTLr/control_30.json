We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend, who is now transitioning as FtM (female-to-male), their \"ex-girlfriend.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author used to date Dan, who was Kate when they were in the relationship. They dated for a few weeks, then broke up. After that, Dan transitioned and started living as a male. The author refers to Dan as an ex-gf because technically, when they were dating, Dan was still identifying as a girl. Now, a mutual acquaintance is upset because the author used that term instead of ex-bf.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about identity and how to refer to someone who has transitioned. Transgender individuals often prefer to be referred to by their current name and pronouns. But when talking about a past relationship, does the author need to adjust the terminology to reflect Dan's current identity or the past one?\n\nThe author's reasoning is that during the time they were dating, Dan was Kate and was a girl, so using \"ex-girlfriend\" is factually accurate. Dan himself didn't seem offended, but the mutual acquaintance was. The mutual friend might be thinking that the author should acknowledge Dan's current identity, even when discussing the past. \n\nI remember some discussions about whether it's appropriate to use someone's former gender when talking about past relationships. For example, if someone is trans and has changed their gender identity, some people might prefer to be called by their current gender terms even when referencing the past. Others might not mind, but the mutual friend here is insistent that it should be ex-boyfriend now. \n\nThe author is non-gay, so this is a straight relationship. But once Dan transitioned, does the author's orientation change in how they refer to the ex? The author is trying to be accurate to the time when they were together. However, there's a social aspect to consider. Trans people often want the present-day references to align with their current identity. So, saying \"ex-girlfriend\" might not be in line with Dan's current identity, even if it was accurate at the time. \n\nBut the problem is that the mutual friend is upset. The author tried to explain their reasoning, but the friend still yelled. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a nuance. The author might not be intentionally misgendering Dan, just being literal. However, the social expectation these days is to use the person's current name and pronouns, which could mean using \"ex-boyfriend\" now. Even if the relationship was in the past, the way we refer to it should respect the person's current identity. \n\nBut Dan himself didn't seem offended, which is a key point. If the person involved is okay with the term, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, the mutual friend might be projecting their own understanding of gender transition onto the situation, thinking that the author should adjust the terminology to match Dan's present self. \n\nWait, but the author is using the term in a way that's factually correct based on the past relationship. There's a difference between being factually accurate and being socially respectful. Transgender individuals often prefer that people use their current identity in all references, including past ones. So, even though the author is technically correct, using the term \"ex-girlfriend\" might not respect Dan's current identity, which could be the issue. \n\nHowever, since Dan didn't seem offended, maybe the mutual friend is overstepping. The author's intention wasn't to be disrespectful, and Dan himself is at peace with the term. But the mutual friend's reaction suggests a belief that the author should use the current identity. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on Dan's preferences. If Dan is okay with it, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is not respecting the current identity, even if Dan is okay, there's a broader social context where using the correct current terms is important. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. The author's rationale is logical, but the broader community might expect using current terms. However, the user's own experience is that Dan didn't mind. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're not misgendering Dan now and using the term that was correct at the time. The mutual friend's reaction could be based on their own lack of understanding. \n\nBut then again, in some cases, even if the person doesn't mind, others might. The author should consider the impact on others and the current social norms. So, perhaps the author is in the middle of a sensitive issue and the mutual friend is right to correct them, but the author's intentions are good. \n\nI think the correct answer is B, No. The author is not in the wrong because they were referring to the past when Dan was a girl. However, it's important to note that after transition, using current identity terms is generally preferred. Since Dan didn't seem offended, the author's approach might be acceptable in this specific context. The mutual friend's reaction could be due to their own perspective, not the author's intent. So, the author isn't wrong, but should perhaps be cautious in the future to align with current terms unless the person involved is okay with the past reference.\n"
