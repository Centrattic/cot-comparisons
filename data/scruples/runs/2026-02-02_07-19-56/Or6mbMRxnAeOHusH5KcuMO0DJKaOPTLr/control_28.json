We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for referring to their ex as \"ex-girlfriend\" even though their ex transitioned after the relationship ended. The situation involves a trans man (FtM) who was in a relationship with the author when they were presenting as female. The author now refers to them as an ex-girlfriend because they were a girl when they were in the relationship. The mutual friend got upset and corrected the author, saying he's an ex-boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the trans person's identity and how others refer to them. Trans people often want to be referred to by their current name and pronouns, even if they had a different name or gender in the past. But here, the author isn't using the past name, just the past gender role in the relationship. So the question is: is it appropriate to refer to a trans man as an ex-girlfriend if the relationship ended before transition?\n\nThis might touch on the concept of \"deadnaming,\" which is using a trans person's former name. However, in this case, the author isn't using the former name but the former gendered term. But the term \"ex-girlfriend\" is gendered. The trans man is now male, so the term \"boyfriend\" could be more appropriate. However, the author's reasoning is that the relationship occurred when the person was a girl. But in reality, the person is now a man, and the author is not gay, so the relationship was with a woman at the time. However, others might argue that the person's gender identity is now male, so referring to them as an ex-girlfriend might be invalidating.\n\nBut the trans person himself didn't seem offended. He just left the conversation. The friend, however, was upset. The author's justification is that it's factually accurate because that's how the relationship was at the time. But in the trans community, people often prefer to be referred to according to their current identity, even in past contexts. So using \"ex-boyfriend\" might be more appropriate to acknowledge their current identity.\n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship was with the person when they were living as a woman, some might argue that \"ex-girlfriend\" is technically correct. However, the term \"ex-girlfriend\" is about the relationship's nature, not the person's gender. If the person is now trans and male, using \"ex-boyfriend\" might be seen as respecting their current identity, even if the relationship was in the past.\n\nThe author is not gay, so the relationship is a straight one, but the person is now trans. So the author is a straight person who dated a trans woman (which they might not realize is a thing), and the person transitioned after the breakup. The issue is whether the author is using the correct term to respect the person's current identity.\n\nIn the trans community, it's important to use the correct pronouns and terms that align with the person's current identity. So even though the relationship was in the past, referring to the person as an ex-boyfriend might be more respectful. The fact that Dan didn't get upset is a point, but the friend did. The friend might be advocating for Dan's current identity.\n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because they're not respecting Dan's current identity by using the past term. Even if the relationship was in the past, using the current term would be more appropriate. The author might be unintentionally reinforcing Dan's past identity, which could be seen as invalidating.\n"
