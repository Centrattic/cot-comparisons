We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a person who dated an FtM (female-to-male) trans person when they were transitioning. The author refers to their ex as a girlfriend because when they were dating, the person was identifying as female. Now, the person is transitioning and presenting as male. \n\nThe main issue is how to refer to the ex in conversation. The author says \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how they identified at the time, but the mutual acquaintance insists on \"ex-boyfriend\" now. The author argues that since the relationship was when the person was a girl, \"ex-girlfriend\" is accurate. The acquaintance got upset, and Dan didn't seem offended.\n\nHmm. I need to consider trans issues here. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by the pronouns and identity they currently identify with. So even if Dan was a girl when they dated, since he's now identifying as male, maybe the correct term is \"ex-boyfriend\" from the present perspective. But the author is pointing out the historical fact of the relationship. \n\nWait, but when someone transitions, their gender identity is what's important. So maybe the author should use the name and pronouns Dan currently uses. However, the author is referring to the past relationship. If Dan was Kate then, but is now Dan, the author might be in a tricky spot. Using Kate's name might be appropriate if that's what Dan wants for the past. But the user is using Dan's current name and past gender, which could be confusing or invalidating. \n\nAlso, trans people often experience what's called \"deadnaming,\" which is using their old name before transition. But here, the author is using the old gender label, not the name. The key is whether Dan is okay with being referred to as a female in the past. Since Dan didn't seem offended, maybe it's okay. But the mutual acquaintance is upset because they think the author is being transphobic by not recognizing Dan's current identity. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the relationship happened in the past when Dan was a girl, so calling them ex-girlfriend is factually accurate. But the acquaintance argues that since Dan is now male, the term should be ex-boyfriend. The author isn't denying Dan's identity now, just stating the historical context. \n\nHowever, in terms of social norms, it's often recommended to respect a person's current identity, even when talking about the past. Using past terms might be seen as ignoring the transition. Even if Dan isn't offended, others might take issue with it. The author's statement could unintentionally signal that Dan's current identity is less valid than the past one. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that using the ex-girlfriend term could be seen as invalidating Dan's current identity. Even if Dan is okay with it, the mutual acquaintance's reaction suggests that the author's approach could be seen as transphobic. The author should probably use Dan's current identity when referring to the relationship, even if that means acknowledging that the relationship was with a trans man. \n\nWait, but the author isn't gay, and they're straight, so if Dan is male now, that makes the author's relationship with Dan as a straight woman with a trans man. That could be a point where the author is okay with that, but the way they phrase it might not be the best. The key is whether the author is respecting Dan's current identity. If the author refers to Dan as a girl in the past, but uses his current name, maybe that's acceptable. But using \"ex-girlfriend\" might be problematic because it's using the past gender label without the past name. \n\nSo, in terms of transphobia, using the past gender without the past name can be an issue. Deadnaming is bad, but using the correct name with past pronouns can be okay if that's what the trans person prefers. If Dan is okay with being called \"ex-girlfriend\" when using his current name, then it's not the author's fault. But if the author is using Dan's current name but past gender, that could be confusing. \n\nThe mutual acquaintance is likely upset because the author is using the past gender label, which doesn't align with current terms. Even if Dan is okay, the author might not be considering the broader implications. The author's approach could be seen as not respecting Dan's transition in how they refer to the past relationship. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that referring to Dan as an ex-girlfriend could be problematic, even if Dan isn't offended. The mutual acquaintance's reaction indicates that the author's phrasing might be seen as transphobic or invalidating. The correct approach would be to use Dan's current identity and terms when discussing the relationship, even if that requires acknowledging the transition.\n"
