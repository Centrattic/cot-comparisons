We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex-girlfriend their ex-girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author dated someone who was transitioning from female to male. They dated when the person was identified as female (Kate) and later transitioned to male (Dan). The author refers to Dan as an ex-girlfriend because when they were in a relationship, Dan was a girl. Now, there's an acquaintance who got upset and said Dan should be called an ex-boyfriend.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. Transgender individuals often have their identity respected based on how they present or identify. The key point is whether the author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" is disrespectful or offensive. The author mentions that Dan didn't seem offended, but the acquaintance was. \n\nTransgender rights and respect are important. Even if the relationship was in the past when the person was presenting as a different gender, the current identity should be respected. So, using past labels might not align with the person's current identity. However, since the relationship occurred in the past, there's a gray area. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's factually accurate because the relationship was during the time Dan was transitioning. But from a trans perspective, using the current identity is more respectful. The acquaintance's reaction suggests that using the past label is seen as misgendering, which can be hurtful. \n\nHowever, the author isn't being malicious; they're trying to explain the facts. But in terms of respect for Dan's identity now, using \"ex-girlfriend\" might not be appropriate. The fact that Dan didn't object could mean he's accepting, but the acquaintance's reaction indicates that the author's phrasing could be seen as transphobic or invalidating Dan's current identity.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because using the past label could be seen as not respecting Dan's current identity, even if the relationship was in the past. The correct approach would be to use Dan's current identity, so referring to him as an ex-boyfriend. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
