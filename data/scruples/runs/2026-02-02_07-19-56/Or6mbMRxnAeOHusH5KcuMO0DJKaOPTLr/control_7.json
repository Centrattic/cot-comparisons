  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for calling my FtM ex my ex-girlfriend?\nSo, there's this FtM guy I used to date when he, let's call him Dan, was still she, let's call her Kate. We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for referring to their FtM ex as an ex-girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person dated Dan when he was Kate, their female identity. After breaking up, Dan transitioned to male. The author is using \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how they knew Dan when they were in the relationship. However, the mutual friend gets upset and corrects them, calling Dan an ex-boyfriend now. The author argues that since Dan was female during the relationship, it's factual to refer to him as ex-girlfriend, and Dan himself isn't offended.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Transgender individuals often prefer to be addressed according to their current identity. However, the timeline here is important. The relationship happened when Dan was still transitioning. But Dan started transitioning after the breakup. So the relationship was with Kate, not Dan. \n\nIn terms of terminology, when referring to past relationships, people often use the name and pronouns that were current at the time. So if the relationship was with Kate, using \"ex-girlfriend\" might be accurate for the author. But trans people usually value being recognized by their current identity. However, since Dan isn't offended, that's a key point. The author's mutual friend might be overreacting, assuming the author should use the current identity for past relationships. \n\nBut wait, some might argue that regardless of the timeline, using the current identity is more respectful. However, if the relationship was before transition, the author's use of past terms could be seen as factually correct. It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong because they're referring to the person as they were during the relationship. Dan's non-offense also shows that he's okay with it. The mutual friend's reaction might be based on a misunderstanding of trans issues. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're being factual about their past relationship. The answer is B.\n"
