We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend after the person transitioned.\n\nFirst, the situation: They dated someone who was assigned female at birth (Kate) and transitioned to male (Dan). The relationship ended before transition. The person in question calls them an ex-girlfriend because that's how they were when they were dating. Now, when others refer to Dan as an ex-boyfriend, the user is sticking with ex-girlfriend, which caused some conflict.\n\nHmm, so, I need to consider trans rights and how names/pronouns are handled. Transitioning individuals often have their gender identity respected as their current identity, regardless of past. But in this case, the relationship was in the past when Dan was Kate. So, is it okay to refer to the relationship as it was?\n\nThe user says Dan isn't offended, but the acquaintance is. The user's reasoning is that it's factually accurate to call Dan their ex-girlfriend because that's how they were during the relationship. But some might argue that using past gender labels could be invalidating, even if the person isn't offended.\n\nWait, trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current names and pronouns. So if Dan is now male, how should his past relationship be referenced? If the user is talking to others about the past, maybe using the past name and identity is okay, but when referring to Dan now, using his current name and identity is appropriate.\n\nBut the issue here is that the acquaintance was upset. The user might not be wrong because Dan isn't offended, but the user's approach could still be problematic if it disregards Dan's current identity in present contexts. However, the user is referring to the past when they were in a relationship, so maybe it's acceptable to describe the relationship as it was.\n\nBut maybe the key is that when talking about the relationship, it's about the past. So calling it an ex-girlfriend in the context of the past makes sense. However, the way it was phrased\u2014\"Dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl\"\u2014might be problematic because it could imply that Dan's current identity isn't valid. Instead, using Kate's name might be better for the past reference, but the user is using the pronoun based on gender then.\n\nIs there a standard here? Some sources suggest that when discussing a trans person's past, it's respectful to use their current name and pronouns if they're comfortable, but if the person prefers to use past names/identities when discussing the past, that should be respected. Since Dan isn't offended, maybe the user is in the right. However, the way the user phrased it might have caused confusion or insensitivity, especially if it's not clear that they're talking about the past.\n\nThe acquaintance's reaction might stem from a place of wanting to respect Dan's current identity, even if the user is recounting the past. The user might not be in the wrong because they're stating facts as they remember, but they might need to be more considerate in how they phrase it to avoid invalidating Dan's current identity. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because Dan isn't offended, but there's a nuance in how it's communicated.\n"
