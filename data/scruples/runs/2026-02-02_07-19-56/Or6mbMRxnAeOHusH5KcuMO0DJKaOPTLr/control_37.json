We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend, who is now transitioning as FtM (female-to-male), their ex-girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dated someone who was assigned female at birth, named Kate, and transitioned to become Dan. They broke up before Dan started transitioning. Now, the author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because that's how they were when they dated. But the mutual acquaintance insists it should be ex-boyfriend, leading to a confrontation.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and respect. Trans individuals often prefer to be referred to by the names and pronouns that align with their current gender identity. Even if the relationship occurred before transition, the person's gender identity is now male, so using female pronouns might be considered disrespectful. However, the author argues that technically, when they were dating, the person was still female, so it's factually accurate.\n\nBut here's the catch: in trans communities, people often prefer to be recognized by their current identity, regardless of their past. So even though the relationship was in the past, using the previous name and pronouns can be seen as invalidating their current identity. The fact that Dan didn't seem offended might be because he's not in the moment, but the mutual acquaintance's reaction suggests that the community's norms are different. The acquaintance's anger could stem from a desire to support Dan's identity.\n\nThe author might not be malicious, but they're not considering Dan's current wishes. The correct approach would be to ask Dan how he wants to be referred to, especially in past contexts. Since the author didn't mention asking Dan directly, they might be making assumptions based on their own understanding rather than Dan's current preferences. This lack of communication could be the author's mistake.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider Dan's current identity preferences and instead relied on their own logic without checking in with Dan. The mutual acquaintance's reaction highlights the importance of respecting trans individuals' current identities, even in past relationships.\n"
