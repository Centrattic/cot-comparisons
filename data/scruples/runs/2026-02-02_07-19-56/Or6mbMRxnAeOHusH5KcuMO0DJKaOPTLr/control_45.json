We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend versus ex-boyfriend. The person, Dan, transitioned from female to male after the relationship ended. The author says they dated when Dan was Kate, so they're using \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how they were when they were in the relationship. The mutual acquaintance got upset and said Dan is the author's ex-boyfriend now, leading to Dan leaving.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about identity and terminology. Trans individuals often emphasize that their current identity is what matters, even if their gender changed. But in this case, the author is pointing out that during the relationship, the person was a woman. So technically, the relationship was with a woman. But when referring to the person now, should it be based on current identity or past identity?\n\nI remember that in trans communities, people often prefer to be referred to by their current name and pronouns. But in this case, the author isn't using Dan's current name when talking about the past; they're using \"Dan\" but referring to him as a girlfriend. Wait, actually, the author says \"Dan used to be my girlfriend when he was a girl.\" So they're using Dan's name but referring to the past gender. That might be confusing because Dan's current name is Dan, but when they were in the relationship, the person's name was Kate. Wait, the user said \"Dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl.\" So they're using \"Dan\" now but talking about the past. That might be part of the issue. Because Dan is their current name, but when they were a girlfriend, the person's name was Kate. The acquaintance might have thought the author should use Dan's current name and refer to the relationship as a boyfriend relationship. But the author is using the past name or not? Wait, the user says \"Dan used to be my girlfriend,\" but Dan is his current name. So maybe the acquaintance felt that using Dan's current name and referring to the past relationship as a girlfriend relationship is conflicting, because Dan is a man now. So the acquaintance might think that the author should refer to the relationship as a boyfriend relationship, using Dan's current name and gender.\n\nBut the author's point is that technically, when they were in the relationship, the person was a girl, so calling them an ex-girlfriend is accurate. However, trans people often prefer that others use their current identity when referring to them, even in past relationships. This is about respecting their identity. The author is using their current name but past gender, which might not align with how trans individuals prefer to be addressed. For example, if a trans man is referred to as a woman in the past, even if that's factually true, it might not be appropriate if he prefers to be known by his male identity now. So the author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" might be seen as invalidating Dan's current identity. The acquaintance might be reacting because they think the author should respect Dan's current gender identity, even when discussing past relationships.\n\nBut the author argues that Dan isn't offended, so maybe the problem isn't with Dan but with the acquaintance. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user is asking if they are the one at fault. The issue here is between the author's factual accuracy and the trans person's identity. In many cases, trans individuals prioritize their current identity over past, so even if factually accurate, using past gendered terms can be hurtful or disrespectful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not using the current terminology that Dan prefers. Even if Dan isn't offended, the author's statement could be problematic because it doesn't align with trans community standards. The acquaintance's reaction might be based on understanding that trans people prefer their current pronouns and terms, so the author's choice to use the past terms could be seen as incorrect, hence the author is in the wrong.\n"
