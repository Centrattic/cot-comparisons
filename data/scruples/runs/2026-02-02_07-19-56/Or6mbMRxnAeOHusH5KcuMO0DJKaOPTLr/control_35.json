We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex a \"girlfriend.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author dated someone (Kate) who later transitioned to become Dan. They broke up before the transition. Now, when referring to Dan, the author says \"ex-girlfriend\" because when they were dating, Dan was Kate. The issue came up when the author told a mutual friend that Dan was their ex-girlfriend, leading to the friend getting upset and Dan leaving.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about identity and how to refer to someone who has transitioned. Transgender individuals often face challenges with being recognized in their current identity. The friend's reaction suggests that the friend believes Dan should be referred to as an ex-boyfriend now, regardless of past gender. The author argues that since they were in a relationship when Dan was female, it's factually correct to call them an ex-girlfriend.\n\nBut wait, there's a concept called \"deadnaming\" where someone refers to a trans person by their former name or gender, which is generally considered disrespectful. However, in this case, the author isn't using Dan's former name but the former gender. The author is using the correct name, Dan, but the pronoun/gender label is based on past identity. \n\nTransgender rights emphasize respecting a person's current identity and chosen name/pronouns. Even if the relationship happened before transition, the trans person might prefer to be referred to in their current gender. So, even if the author isn't being intentionally disrespectful, using the former gender label could be seen as invalidating Dan's current identity. The fact that Dan didn't object might indicate he's okay with it, but the friend's strong reaction suggests there's a social norm here that the author isn't following. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that it's factually accurate because the relationship occurred when Dan was female. But in many trans communities, the current identity is what matters, not past identities. So while the author might not have ill intent, they might be overlooking Dan's current identity preferences. \n\nAlso, the mutual friend's reaction might stem from understanding that respecting Dan's current identity is important, even if the author's intention was to be truthful. The key is whether the author's words were harmful. Since Dan didn't seem offended, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the friend's upset reaction indicates that there's a social expectation to use current labels.\n\nSo, is it a factual error or a social misstep? If the author uses \"ex-girlfriend\" to reflect the past relationship, it's factually correct. But in terms of respecting Dan's current identity, using the current label is more appropriate. The author might be right in a factual sense but wrong in a social/emotional context.\n\nThe question is whether being factually accurate takes precedence over respecting the trans person's current identity. In many cases, the community prioritizes current identity, so the author might be in the wrong for not using the current label, even if it's factually correct.\n"
