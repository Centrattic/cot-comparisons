We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for referring to their FtM (female-to-male) ex as an ex-girlfriend. The situation is that they dated when the person was identifying as female (Kate) and then the person transitioned and became Dan. The author says \"ex-gf\" because during the relationship, the person was a she, and now they're a he. The mutual acquaintance got upset and corrected the author, saying it's ex-boyfriend now.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about correct terminology when someone transitions. The author is using the term based on the gender they had during the relationship. But after transitioning, the person is now male, so the correct term would be ex-boyfriend. However, the author is not gay, and the relationship was in the past when the ex was female. \n\nI need to consider trans individuals' perspectives. Many trans people prefer to be referred to by the names and pronouns they currently use. So, even though the relationship was in the past when they were Kate, the correct term now would be ex-boyfriend. The author's reasoning is based on the past, but the person has transitioned, so using the updated terms is likely more respectful.\n\nThe acquaintance's reaction makes sense because they might be advocating for the trans person's current identity. Even if Dan isn't offended, the author's statement could be insensitive. It's important to recognize that transitioning is a process, and using past labels can be invalidating. So the author might be in the wrong for not using Dan's current identity.\n"
