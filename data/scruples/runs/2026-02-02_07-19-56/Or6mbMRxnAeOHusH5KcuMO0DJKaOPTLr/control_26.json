We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for referring to their FtM ex as their ex-girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The person dated Dan (formerly Kate) when they were female. After the relationship ended, Dan came out as FtM and started transitioning. The author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because that's how they were during the relationship. However, a mutual acquaintance corrects them, saying Dan is now a man, so the correct term should be ex-boyfriend.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about the appropriate terminology for a transgender person's past relationship. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current identity and pronouns. Even though the relationship occurred when Dan was living as Kate, some might argue that since Dan is now male, the relationship should be acknowledged in the context of his current identity. However, others might see it as factually accurate to describe the relationship as it was at the time, especially if the person doesn't identify as gay now and Dan isn't offended.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The trans community often emphasizes respecting a person's current identity and preferred terms. Some might feel that using past labels can be invalidating. However, if Dan himself isn't offended, that suggests he's okay with how the author refers to the relationship. The acquaintance's reaction, though, is a third party's perspective. The key point is whether the author's wording is respectful and accurate according to Dan's preferences.\n\nSince the author explains their reasoning and Dan didn't express offense, but the acquaintance insists on using the term ex-boyfriend, it's a matter of perspective. The author isn't being malicious; they're trying to be factually accurate. However, there's a chance that using the past label might not align with Dan's current identity or how the community expects to be addressed. But since Dan isn't upset, maybe the author isn't wrong. \n\nBut wait, sometimes the correct term is based on the person's transition. For example, if someone transitions before the relationship, they might prefer to be seen as their current gender in all contexts. However, if the relationship was during their transition or before, it can be more complex. The author's situation is that the relationship was before transition, and the transition happened after the breakup. So, in that case, referring to the past relationship as it was might still be acceptable, especially if the person is comfortable with it. \n\nThe acquaintance's reaction could be based on a lack of understanding about trans issues, or it might be right to prioritize the current identity. But since the author isn't causing harm to Dan and Dan isn't offended, the author might be in the right. On the other hand, the author might not be considering the broader implications of how such terms affect trans individuals in general. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intention is to be accurate based on the time of the relationship, and since Dan isn't offended, it's likely the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
