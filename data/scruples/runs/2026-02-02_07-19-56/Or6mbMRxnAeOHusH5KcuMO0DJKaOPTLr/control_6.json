We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (now FtM) their ex-girlfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user is someone who dated Dan, who was Kate when they were dating. After they broke up, Dan transitioned and is now male. The user refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because when they were dating, Dan was identifying as a girl. The user is not gay, so technically, in their view, the relationship was with a girl. However, the mutual acquaintance is upset because the user called Dan their ex-boyfriend instead, and Dan didn't seem to mind. The user explained their reasoning, but the acquaintance was still upset.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about how to refer to a trans person's past relationships. Trans individuals often prefer to be referred to by their current identity, even if their past identity was different. However, some people might consider the past identity valid for the time they lived it. \n\nThe user is using \"ex-girlfriend\" because during the relationship, Dan was Kate. The acquaintance is correcting the user, suggesting it's an ex-boyfriend now. Dan himself didn't seem to be offended, which is a bit confusing. But the user's friend was upset. \n\nWait, but trans people's names and pronouns can be sensitive. Even if Dan is okay with being called \"ex-girlfriend,\" respecting their current identity is important. However, if Dan is transitioning and now identifies as male, then using male pronouns and the current title might be more appropriate. The user's reasoning is that the relationship happened when Dan was female, but trans people often want their current identity to be recognized in all contexts. \n\nBut here's the thing: the user is using the past gender identity. If Dan is non-binary or male now, but transitioned after the relationship, the user might be correct in referring to the past as a girlfriend. However, the standard in many communities is to use the current gender identity for the relationship status. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the user is using the former gender identity, which could be seen as invalidating Dan's current identity. Even if Dan isn't upset, others might be. The acquaintance might be advocating for Dan's current identity being respected. So the user's statement could be seen as not respecting Dan's transition, even if Dan isn't upset. \n\nBut Dan didn't seem offended. However, the user's friend is. The user is defending their choice because the relationship was when Dan was female. But in terms of societal norms, when someone transitions, their relationships are often referred to in the context of their current identity. For example, if someone transitions from female to male, their past partners might be considered ex-girlfriends or ex-boyfriends based on the current identity. \n\nSo if the user is not gay, but the relationship was with a trans man who was female at the time, then technically, the user's statement is factually accurate. However, in terms of social norms and sensitivity, the user might be overlooking Dan's current identity. \n\nThe user's friend is likely arguing that regardless of past identity, the relationship should be acknowledged in the context of Dan's current identity. Therefore, calling him an ex-boyfriend respects his current identity. Even if Dan isn't upset, the user might still be wrong because it's about respecting the trans person's identity. \n\nBut this is tricky because there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. Some trans people are okay with being referred to by their former identity in past contexts, while others may not be. The user's explanation is that Dan isn't offended, but the friend is. The user's friend might be overstepping, but the user's approach might not be the best. \n\nIn conclusion, the user is in the wrong because they are using the former identity in a way that could be seen as invalidating the trans person's current identity. Even if the trans person isn't upset, the user should consider the current identity for proper respect. So the answer would be A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
