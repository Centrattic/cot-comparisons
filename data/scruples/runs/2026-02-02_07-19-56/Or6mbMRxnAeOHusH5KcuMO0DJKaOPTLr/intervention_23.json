We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex \"ex-girlfriend.\" The situation is that the person (Dan) was in a relationship with the author when they were Kate, female, before transitioning. The author is non-gay, so they might feel more comfortable referring to Kate as their ex-girlfriend. The mutual friend got upset, saying it's ex-boyfriend now.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is about pronouns and how to refer to someone who has transitioned. Transgender people often prefer to be recognized with their current identity. Even if the relationship happened in the past when they were a different gender, the person might want to be acknowledged with their current title. The author argues that technically, it's accurate because the relationship was in the past when the person was a girl. But from a sensitivity standpoint, maybe the friend was right to correct it because Dan might prefer to be seen as a man now.\n\nWait, but the story says Dan didn't seem offended. So maybe the author's approach is okay because Dan didn't take offense. But the friend was upset. The friend might be advocating for Dan's current identity. The author's explanation is logical, but maybe the friend is right in that the terminology should reflect Dan's current gender. Even if the relationship was in the past, using the current pronouns and terms might be more respectful. The author might be in the wrong because they are prioritizing factual accuracy over the person's current identity. Trans people often ask for respect in their current presentation, even in past contexts. So using \"ex-boyfriend\" would align with Dan's current identity, even though the relationship was in the past. The friend's reaction is about supporting Dan's transition, not about correctness. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not using the preferred term.\n"
