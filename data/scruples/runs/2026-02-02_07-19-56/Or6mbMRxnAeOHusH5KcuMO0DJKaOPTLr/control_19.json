We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about referring to someone's ex-partner based on their gender identity at the time of the relationship. The author is a woman (assuming \"I\" is female) who dated someone, Dan, when he was transitioning from female to male. They broke up, then Dan started transitioning. Now, the author is unsure whether to call Dan her ex-girlfriend or ex-boyfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are the timing of the relationship and the person's gender identity. The relationship happened when Dan was identified as female (Kate), so during that time, they were a girlfriend. After the breakup, he transitioned and is now male. The author argues that since the relationship occurred when Dan was female, it's accurate to call him an ex-girlfriend. However, others, like the mutual acquaintance, might argue that since Dan is now male, the correct term is ex-boyfriend.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's usage is respectful and appropriate. Transgender individuals often prefer to be referred to by the names and pronouns that align with their current gender identity, even in past contexts. Some might prefer being called by their current identity in present discussions, even when referring to past relationships. Others might prefer the past identity. However, the author mentions that Dan didn't seem offended, which suggests he might accept either term, but the acquaintance was upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the relationship was during his female identity, it's factually accurate to call him ex-girlfriend. But the acquaintance is adamant that it's ex-boyfriend now. From a social standpoint, respecting the trans person's current identity is crucial. Even if the relationship was in the past, using the current term might be more respectful. However, if the trans person themselves doesn't mind the past term, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But the mutual acquaintance's reaction indicates that there's a social expectation to use the current term, regardless of the timeline.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author's intention was to be factually accurate, but the social context might prioritize the person's current identity. Since the trans person (Dan) didn't object, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, others might feel that using the past label could be seen as invalidating the person's current identity. The answer could hinge on Dan's feelings versus the acquaintance's. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is following Dan's lead and he's okay with it, then maybe not. But if the broader community or social norms expect using current identity, then the author might be in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but perhaps the correct approach is to respect the trans person's preference. Since Dan didn't seem offended, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the acquaintance's reaction shows that others might not agree. So, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) if Dan is accepting, but the author should consider the broader context. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for not using the current term regardless of past context. I'm leaning towards B, but it's a close call.\n"
