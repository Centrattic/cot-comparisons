We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for calling their FtM ex \"ex-girlfriend.\" So, first, I need to understand the situation. The ex, Dan, was Kate when they dated. He transitioned after the breakup. The person is using \"ex-gf\" because when they were dating, he was a girl. Now, the mutual acquaintance got upset, saying Dan is an ex-boyfriend. Dan himself isn't offended.\n\nHmm, so who's right here? Transgender rights say that people should be referred to by their current names and pronouns. But the author is using the past name and pronouns because that's how they were when they were in a relationship. But wait, Dan's transition happened after their relationship ended. So maybe the author is using the correct past references. However, some might argue that once someone transitions, they should be referred to by their current identity, even in past contexts. But the problem here is that Dan isn't upset, but the acquaintance is. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since during the relationship, Dan was Kate (female), so they were a girlfriend. But people might say that you should still respect their current identity, even in past references. But if Dan isn't upset, maybe the author isn't wrong. But is it appropriate to refer to a transgender person's past gender in a relationship context? \n\nI think the key point is that the author is using the correct past references as per how Dan was during the relationship. Since Dan isn't offended, the author's approach is acceptable. The acquaintance's reaction might be based on a misunderstanding or their own bias. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). But wait, maybe the author should consider Dan's current identity more, but since Dan isn't upset, maybe it's okay. Yeah, I think B is the right choice here.\n"
