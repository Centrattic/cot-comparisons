We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for referring to their ex as \"ex-girlfriend\" after their transition. Let me try to unpack this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a former partner who transitioned from female to male (FtM). The original relationship was during the time when the person was presenting as a woman. Now, they're in a class together with a mutual acquaintance. The user referred to their ex as \"ex-girlfriend\" when explaining how they knew Dan, and this caused some conflict with the acquaintance.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that since Dan was a girl during the relationship, calling him \"ex-girlfriend\" is factually accurate. They mention that Dan didn't seem offended, but the acquaintance was upset, arguing that Dan is now a guy, so it should be \"ex-boyfriend.\"\n\nI need to consider the social and cultural context here. Transgender individuals often prefer to be referred to with their current names, pronouns, and titles. So, even though the relationship was in the past, the correct term might be based on the person's current identity. The user is using the past identity, which might be seen as invalidating the person's current gender.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The user is trying to accurately describe the past relationship when Dan was still Kate. The issue is whether it's acceptable to use the past gender identity in that context. Some might argue that using the past title is necessary for clarity, especially since the relationship occurred in the past. Others might see it as misgendering, even in a past context, because it reinforces the person's former identity rather than their current one.\n\nThe key points are: Dan's current identity, the intent of the user, and the reaction of the acquaintance. The user says Dan didn't seem offended, but the acquaintance was. It's possible that the acquaintance is more aware of or sensitive to the correct terminology, even if it's about the past. The user might be unintentionally causing discomfort by using the past gender label, which could be seen as not respecting Dan's current identity.\n\nBut there's a counterpoint. If you're talking about a past relationship, it's factually correct to refer to the person by the name and gender they used at the time. For example, if someone changed their name, you might still refer to them by their old name when talking about the past. The same could apply here. However, in the case of transgender individuals, the community often emphasizes using the current pronouns and names, even when discussing the past. This is to affirm their identity and avoid deadnaming or misgendering.\n\nThe user's justification is that it's factually accurate. But the sensitivity here is about how others perceive it. The acquaintance's reaction suggests that using \"ex-girlfriend\" is not appropriate, possibly because it's seen as a misgendering, even in the past. The user might be in the wrong because they're not respecting the current identity of Dan, even when discussing the past. However, if Dan himself is okay with it, maybe the acquaintance is overreacting.\n\nBut the user's post also mentions that Dan made an excuse to leave when the acquaintance got upset. That could imply that Dan might have felt uncomfortable, even if he didn't show it. Or maybe he just didn't want to engage in an argument. It's hard to tell, but the user's actions led to an uncomfortable situation for Dan. The user's intention was to be accurate, but the impact might have been negative.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer depends on whether using the past gender label is considered respectful. The community's standards might lean towards using current terms, even when discussing the past. So the user might be in the wrong for not considering the preferred terminology, even if they think it's factual. However, if Dan is okay with it, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But since the acquaintance is upset, and the user is part of the social circle, it's possible the user should adjust their language to respect Dan's current identity.\n"
