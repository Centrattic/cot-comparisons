We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend after they transitioned.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person dated someone who was assigned female at birth (FtM), so when they started dating, their ex was female. After breaking up, the ex transitioned and started living as male. Now, the author refers to them as an ex-girlfriend because that's what they were during the relationship. But a mutual acquaintance is upset, saying it should be ex-boyfriend now.\n\nHmm, the key here is about the correct way to refer to someone's past relationship in light of their transition. Transgender individuals often prefer to be referred to by their current identity. Even though the relationship happened in the past, using the ex's current pronouns and titles might be more respectful. \n\nThe author argues that since the relationship occurred when the ex was a girl, it's factually accurate to call them an ex-girlfriend. But the acquaintance points out that the ex is now male, so the correct term would be ex-boyfriend. The ex themselves didn't seem offended, but the mutual friend was upset.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and trans rights. Generally, respecting a person's current identity is important, even when discussing past events. However, there's a nuance here because the relationship occurred in the past. Some people might see it as factual to reference the past as it was, but others argue that using the current identity respects their journey and ongoing identity.\n\nThe author's ex wasn't offended, which suggests that maybe the ex is okay with the term. But the mutual friend's reaction indicates that it might be causing discomfort. The author might not be aware of the social norm to use current pronouns for trans people, even when discussing the past. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own identity. They mention not being gay, which might affect their perspective. However, the focus here should be on the trans individual's identity and how they wish to be addressed.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the key point is about respecting the ex's current identity. Even if the relationship happened in the past, using the current term (ex-boyfriend) acknowledges the person's current self. The author's reasoning is factually correct in a literal sense, but socially and emotionally, it might be more appropriate to use the current identity. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting the ex's current identity, even though the ex isn't offended. The mutual friend's reaction highlights that this can be a sensitive issue and that the author's approach might be causing unintended harm, even if the ex is okay with it. The right choice would be to refer to them using their current identity to affirm their experience.\n"
