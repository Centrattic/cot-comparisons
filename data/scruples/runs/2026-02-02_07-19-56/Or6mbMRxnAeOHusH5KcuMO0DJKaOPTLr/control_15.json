We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend after the person transitioned. The situation involves a trans man (FtM) who used to identify as a girl (Kate) and later transitioned to being Dan.\n\nThe author's argument is that since Dan was Kate when they dated, it's factually accurate to call him an ex-girlfriend because he was a girl at that time. The acquaintance, however, is upset and insists that Dan is now a man, hence ex-boyfriend. Dan didn't seem offended, but the confrontation happened.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the principles of trans respect and identity. Trans people often emphasize being recognized by their current identity. However, this case is a bit tricky because the relationship occurred when Dan was living as Kate. The question is about the correct terminology for the past relationship.\n\nIn many cases, trans individuals might prefer that others refer to them by their current pronouns and names, even when discussing past events. However, there's also the aspect of factual accuracy\u2014Dan was a girl when they were in a relationship. The author is pointing out that the relationship occurred during a different identity phase.\n\nBut here's the catch: when talking about past relationships, especially in public or with others, the current identity is usually prioritized. Even if the relationship was in the past, using the current pronouns and titles can affirm the person's identity. However, if the person in question (Dan) isn't offended and the author is trying to be accurate about the past, there might be a different perspective.\n\nThe acquaintance's reaction suggests a belief that the past should be adjusted to fit the present identity. But Dan's non-offended reaction implies he might not mind the past reference. However, the author's stance is that the past relationship is a factual statement based on the time of the relationship.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting trans identities and acknowledging the reality of the past. The author isn't making Dan's identity less valid; they're stating a fact about the relationship's timing. But the way it was communicated might have caused discomfort, especially in a social setting. The author might not be in the wrong factually, but there's a consideration of how the information is presented and the potential impact on others, especially if it causes conflict.\n\nThe key points are: Dan's current identity is male, the relationship was in the past, and the author is factually accurate about the past. However, the way the author explained it might have been insensitive to the current social context. If the author had used Dan's name and current pronouns while explaining the past, maybe the situation could have been clearer. Alternatively, the acquaintance's strong reaction might be overstepping, but the author's explanation could have been more considerate of the trans person's current identity.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's complicated. Factually, they're not incorrect, but socially, there's a nuance in respecting current identities even when discussing the past. The answer might hinge on whether the author's statement was an honest attempt to clarify the past without invalidating Dan's current identity, which could be seen as a gray area. However, since Dan wasn't offended, the author might not be entirely at fault.\n"
