We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend. The situation involves a transition from female to male (FtM), and the author is trying to figure out the correct way to refer to their past relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author dated someone named Dan (Kate) before they started transitioning. The relationship ended, and then Dan transitioned. The author refers to Dan as an ex-girlfriend because during the relationship, Dan was a woman. However, a mutual acquaintance corrected them, saying Dan is an ex-boyfriend now, which caused some tension.\n\nSo the main issue is about the correct pronoun and title to use when discussing a past relationship of a trans person. Trans individuals often have their identities respected based on their current presentation, regardless of their past. Even if the relationship happened when they were transitioning, the current identity is what's important for how they are addressed now. \n\nThe author argues that since the relationship was during the female phase, calling them an ex-girlfriend is factually accurate. However, the social and respectful approach is to use their current identity. Trans people often prefer to be recognized by their current gender, and using past labels can be seen as invalidating their current identity. \n\nThe acquaintance might be reacting because referring to Dan as an ex-girlfriend could be perceived as not respecting his current identity as male. Even if Dan himself isn't offended, the fact that the acquaintance is upset might indicate that the author's choice of words could be hurtful or misrepresenting Dan's identity.\n\nAdditionally, in some contexts, using a person's past gender can be considered deadnaming, which is a serious issue in the trans community. Deadnaming refers to using someone's former name or gender that they no longer identify with. While the author isn't using a name, they are using a past gender role, which might fall into a similar category of misgendering.\n\nThe author's rationale is based on factual accuracy, but in social interactions, especially with trans individuals, the emphasis is on respecting their current identity. Even if the person isn't offended, the author could still be in the wrong because the correct approach is to align with the individual's current identity, regardless of past circumstances.\n\nSo, the answer here would be that the author is in the wrong because they should respect Dan's current identity and refer to him accordingly, even if it means acknowledging a past relationship in a way that might not align with their own sexual orientation labels.\n"
