We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for referring to their ex FtM as an ex-girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person dated Dan, who transitioned after they broke up. The author refers to Dan as an ex-girlfriend because when they were dating, Dan was Kate. Now, the mutual friend got upset, saying Dan should be called an ex-boyfriend. Dan himself didn't seem offended. \n\nHmm. The author is arguing that since the relationship happened when Dan was female, it's technically accurate to call Kate their ex-girlfriend. But the friend is pushing back, maybe because now Dan is male and the friend thinks it's more respectful to use current pronouns. \n\nI need to consider trans issues here. Trans people often prefer to be recognized by their current identity. So referring to them by their past gender might be seen as invalidating. Even if Dan isn't offended, the friend's reaction might stem from supporting trans rights. The author might be stuck on the factual timeline, but the social norm is to use current names and pronouns. \n\nWait, but Dan didn't seem offended. So maybe the issue is more about the friend's perspective. The author's explanation is that it's factually correct, but from a trans-inclusive standpoint, using deadnames or past genders can be hurtful. Even if the person isn't, others might take issue. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because the correct approach is to respect the person's current identity, regardless of the past. The fact that Dan didn't argue doesn't mean the friend's reaction isn't valid. It's about respecting Dan's transition now.\n"
