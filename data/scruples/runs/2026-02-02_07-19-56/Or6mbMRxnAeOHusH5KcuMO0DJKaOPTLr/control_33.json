We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling their ex a \"girlfriend\" after the person transitioned. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a relationship with Dan, who was previously Kate. They dated for a few weeks, and after breaking up a few months later, Dan transitioned and started living as a male. The author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because when they were dating, Dan was presenting as female. \n\nNow, the key points here are about the terminology and respect for Dan's identity. Transitioning individuals often have specific preferences regarding how their past relationships are referred to. Even though the relationship happened in the past, using the former name and pronouns can be sensitive. The mutual acquaintance corrected the author, calling Dan the ex-boyfriend instead. The author argues that it's factually accurate because Dan was a girl then and the author is not gay. But the acquaintance was upset, and Dan left the conversation.\n\nI remember that in trans communities, people often prefer to be referred to by their current names and pronouns, even when discussing past relationships. So, even though the relationship was in the past, using \"ex-girlfriend\" might not align with Dan's current identity. The author's reasoning is based on the time when they were dating, but transitioning is about the person's identity now. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the acquaintance reacted. They might be advocating for Dan's current identity, which is a common way to show support. The author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" could be seen as invalidating Dan's transition, even if the author's intention was to be factually correct. Trans people often face challenges with being recognized in their true identity, so past relationships should be discussed in a way that respects their current self. \n\nDan not being offended is a point the author makes, but that doesn't necessarily mean the terminology is appropriate. Some trans individuals might appreciate being acknowledged in their current identity, even if the past is technically correct. The mutual acquaintance's correction might be based on understanding trans experiences better than the author does. \n\nSo, the author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" could be considered incorrect in this context. The correct approach is to use the name and pronouns the person currently identifies with, regardless of the relationship's past. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by not using Dan's current identity terms.\n"
