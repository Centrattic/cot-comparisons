We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about how to refer to an ex who is transitioning from female to male. The author, let's call them the narrator, dated someone named Dan (formerly Kate) when Dan was identifying as female. After they broke up, Dan transitioned and started living as male.\n\nThe narrator is using \"ex-girlfriend\" because during their relationship, Dan was a girl. However, their mutual acquaintance insists that Dan is now a guy, so the correct term is \"ex-boyfriend.\" The narrator argues that it's factually accurate to call Dan their ex-girlfriend because that's how they were when they were in a relationship. Dan himself doesn't seem offended, but the acquaintance is upset.\n\nSo, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for using \"ex-girlfriend.\" Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, understanding the trans experience. Transitioning individuals often have their current identity respected. Even if someone was assigned female at birth, if they now identify and live as male, using their current gender in reference is important. So, the trans person's current identity is primary. \n\nThe narrator is using the past gender, which might be considered problematic because it could be seen as not recognizing Dan's current identity. Even if the relationship happened in the past when Dan was living as female, using past pronouns or labels might not align with how Dan wants to be perceived now. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current names and pronouns regardless of their past. \n\nBut the narrator mentions that Dan didn't seem offended. That complicates things. If Dan is comfortable with being called ex-girlfriend, does that override the general rule? However, the acquaintance is upset, thinking the narrator is being disrespectful. The key here is whether the narrator's use of the term is respectful and in line with Dan's current wishes. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the narrator's own identity. The narrator says they're not gay, which might influence their choice of terms. But the focus should be on Dan's identity now. Trans people often emphasize using current gender identity, so the correct term would be ex-boyfriend. \n\nBut the narrator is trying to explain that the relationship was with a girl, so using ex-girlfriend makes sense in that context. However, if Dan is now male, even if the relationship was in the past, the term might not be appropriate. It might be better to refer to Dan using their current identity, even if the relationship was in the past. \n\nAnother angle: the mutual acquaintance is the one who's upset, not Dan. That could mean the narrator isn't directly violating Dan's wishes. But the acquaintance's reaction might stem from not wanting to see transphobic language, even if the narrator is trying to be honest. \n\nSo, is the narrator wrong? They might be unintentionally reinforcing deadnaming or misgendering, even though Dan isn't offended. The correct approach is usually to respect the trans person's current identity and use their current labels. So, the narrator's use of ex-girlfriend might be incorrect from a trans perspective, even if Dan isn't offended. The acquaintance's reaction could be based on knowing that it's better to use current terms. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A \u2013 the narrator is in the wrong because they should respect Dan's current identity and use ex-boyfriend, even if the relationship was in the past when Dan was living as female.\n"
