We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex \"my ex-girlfriend.\" The situation is a bit nuanced because the ex, Dan (formerly Kate), transitioned after the relationship ended. The author's reasoning is that technically, when they were dating, Dan was still a girl, so \"ex-girlfriend\" is factually accurate. However, the mutual acquaintance took offense, arguing that Dan should now be referred to as the author's \"ex-boyfriend.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around transgender individuals and their relationships. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by the names and pronouns that align with their current gender identity. Even if the relationship occurred before transition, many in the trans community and their allies believe that acknowledging the person's current identity is respectful. So, calling Dan an \"ex-boyfriend\" might be more appropriate now, regardless of past labels.\n\nHowever, the author points out that Dan didn't seem offended and even that the acquaintance was the one who got upset. This complicates things because the person's own feelings about the label might matter more than others' reactions. If Dan is comfortable with \"ex-girlfriend,\" then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But trans individuals can have varied experiences, and what's respectful might not always be clear-cut.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the mutual acquaintance. The friend felt strongly enough to confront the author, which might indicate that in their social context, using past labels is frowned upon. The author's rationale is based on factual correctness, but social dynamics often prioritize respect over technical accuracy. \n\nI should also consider that the author is not gay, which might influence their perspective. The label \"ex-girlfriend\" might feel more accurate to them because their relationship was with a female-identifying person at the time. However, transitioning individuals might prefer their new identity to be acknowledged in all contexts, including past relationships. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might not be malicious, the social expectation in many communities is to use the current identity of transgender individuals. The fact that the acquaintance was offended and that the friend (Dan) left the situation might suggest that the author's choice of words, though factually correct in a literal sense, was socially insensitive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from a social standpoint, even if Dan himself isn't upset. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and considering that Dan didn't object, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the broader context of respecting trans identities typically leans towards using current labels.\n"
