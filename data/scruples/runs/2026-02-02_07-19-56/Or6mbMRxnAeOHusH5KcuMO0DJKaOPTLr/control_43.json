We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Adults question is in the wrong. The situation is about referring to their ex as a girlfriend when the person is now transitioning from female to male (FtM). The user says they dated when the person was presenting as female, and now the person is transitioning. They called them their ex-girlfriend, but a mutual acquaintance got upset and said it should be ex-boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the social and cultural norms around transgender people and how to refer to them. Transgender individuals often want to be addressed by their current names and pronouns. But in this case, the person transitioned after the relationship ended. So, does the past relationship's context affect how we refer to them now?\n\nThe user argues that since the relationship happened when Dan was Kate, it's factually accurate to call them a former girlfriend. However, the mutual friend took offense, suggesting that using the term \"ex-boyfriend\" is correct now. But Dan himself didn't seem offended. The user's reasoning is that the relationship was in the past, so using past pronouns and terms is accurate.\n\nI remember that the general rule is to use the name and pronouns the person currently uses, even when talking about the past. But there are exceptions. If the person is no longer in a relationship with you, and they've transitioned, some people might prefer to be referred to in their current identity. However, others might feel that using their past identity when discussing the past relationship is acceptable, especially if that's how they were known at the time.\n\nIn this case, Dan didn't seem offended, which is a key point. If the person being referred to isn't upset, maybe the user isn't wrong. But the mutual acquaintance was upset, which complicates things. However, the user's intention was to be accurate based on the time period. \n\nAnother angle is that the user isn't closeted with Dan but is trying to be truthful in conversation with another person. The user might not be aware of Dan's current preferences. But since Dan is transitioning, it's possible that they prefer to be referred to in their current gender identity even when discussing past relationships. \n\nHowever, the user isn't the one who transitioned; Dan is. So, the user's use of past terms might be a reflection of the actual past context. If Dan is okay with it, maybe the user isn't wrong. The key here is the impact on Dan. Since Dan didn't show any offense, the user might not be in the wrong. The mutual acquaintance's reaction is their own issue, not necessarily the user's fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the user isn't in the wrong because they were referring to the past relationship accurately, and the person in question isn't offended. The mutual friend's reaction is more about their own perspective than the user's intent.\n"
