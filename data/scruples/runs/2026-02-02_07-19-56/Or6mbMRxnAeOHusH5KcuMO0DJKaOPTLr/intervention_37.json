We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an ex who transitioned from female to male. The author refers to him as their ex-girlfriend, which causes some conflict with a mutual acquaintance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person transitioned after the relationship ended. So when they were in a relationship, the person was identifying as female (Kate), and now as male (Dan). The author is using \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's what the person was during the relationship. But the mutual friend is upset and insists it's \"ex-boyfriend\" now. \n\nI know that in discussions about trans people, respecting their current identity is really important. However, the author's point is that the relationship happened when the person was a different gender. This seems to be a factual statement from the author's perspective. But maybe the issue is that the author is using the past gender in a way that the trans person might not want to be referred to anymore.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that Dan didn't seem offended. That's a key point. If Dan is okay with being called ex-girlfriend, then maybe the author isn't wrong. However, the mutual acquaintance might be projecting their views onto Dan. The author's rationale is that the relationship was with Kate, so the term ex-girlfriend is accurate. But there's a social aspect where trans people often prefer to be recognized by their current identity, even in past contexts. \n\nBut does that apply here? The author is not misgendering Dan now; they're just describing the past relationship. However, some might argue that using the term ex-girlfriend could be seen as invalidating Dan's current identity. The mutual friend's reaction suggests that they think the author should refer to Dan as a boy now, regardless of the past. \n\nThe author is in a tricky spot. They might be correct in a factual sense, but socially, it's important to respect the trans person's current identity. Even if Dan isn't offended, the mutual friend's reaction could be based on the idea that transitioning means the person's gender is now male, and thus the relationship should be referred to in present terms. \n\nBut the author is explaining their reasoning, and Dan isn't upset. So maybe the issue is with the mutual friend's assumption rather than the author's statement. The author isn't misgendering Dan now, just describing past events. However, some people might find it hurtful to be referred to by a past gender, even in the context of a past relationship. \n\nIn terms of the question, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. The author isn't intentionally being disrespectful, and Dan isn't offended. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, there's a social norm to respect the current identity, so perhaps the author should consider using a different term to avoid causing discomfort, even if their reasoning is factually correct. \n\nHmm. The key factors are Dan's reaction (not offended) and the author's intent. If the author is being respectful and Dan is okay with it, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if the mutual friend is right in thinking that the author should use the current identity, then the author might be in the wrong. However, the author's explanation about the relationship context seems valid. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether referring to the past gender in the context of a past relationship is acceptable. Since Dan isn't upset, it's possible the author is not in the wrong. But the mutual friend's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps not understanding the nuance. So the author's approach might be defensible.\n"
