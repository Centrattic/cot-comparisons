We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for referring to their FtM ex as an ex-girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a person transitioning from female to male. They were in a relationship when they were identifying as female (Kate), then transitioned and became Dan. The author is now using \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how they were during the relationship. The mutual acquaintance is upset, calling Dan the ex-boyfriend now.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is wrong for using the term \"ex-girlfriend.\" Let me consider the perspectives here. The author is pointing out that technically, during the relationship, Dan was Kate. So referring to Kate as the ex-girlfriend seems factually accurate from their perspective. However, the acquaintance argues that now Dan is male, so using ex-boyfriend is more appropriate.\n\nBut wait, the key here is the trans person's identity. Trans individuals often prefer to be referred to by their current names and pronouns, even when discussing past relationships. So if Dan is now identified as male, the appropriate term might be ex-boyfriend. However, the author mentions that Dan isn't offended. Dan's lack of objection might suggest that he doesn't take issue with the term, but the mutual acquaintance is upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the past identity. But in the trans community, the current identity is usually prioritized. Even if the relationship occurred in the past, using the current pronouns and names is respectful. The acquaintance's reaction might stem from understanding that, hence why they corrected the author.\n\nHowever, the author isn't the one transitioning, so they might not fully grasp the nuances. The fact that Dan didn't react negatively is important. But the mutual acquaintance's discomfort suggests that there's a social norm here to use current labels. The author's use of past labels could be seen as not respecting Dan's current identity, even if Dan isn't offended. The issue is whether the author is wrong for using past labels when the current identity is male.\n\nIn many cases, trans individuals appreciate being referred to in the present tense with their current identity. So, even if the relationship was in the past, using \"ex-boyfriend\" would align with Dan's current identity. The author's argument is about factual accuracy in the past, but the social norm is to use current pronouns and terms. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not using the current terms, even if Dan didn't object. The mutual acquaintance's reaction is a sign that this is a sensitive area. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
