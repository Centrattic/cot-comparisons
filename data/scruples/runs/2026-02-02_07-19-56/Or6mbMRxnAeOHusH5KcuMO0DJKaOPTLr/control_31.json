We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (now a trans man) as their ex-girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person used to date Dan, who was transitioning from female to male. They dated when Dan was presenting as a girl (Kate). After breaking up, Dan transitioned and came out as trans. The author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend, which caused some backlash from a mutual acquaintance who insists Dan should be called an ex-boyfriend. The author's reasoning is that technically, during the relationship, Dan was a girl, and they are not gay, so using \"ex-girlfriend\" is factually accurate. However, the acquaintance was offended, and Dan didn't seem to mind.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a trans-inclusive perspective, the key point is about how trans individuals want to be addressed. Transitioning involves a person's gender identity and preferred pronouns. Even though Dan was assigned female at birth, once he starts transitioning and is living as his authentic male identity, many trans individuals would prefer to be referred to in the gender they identify with now, regardless of past relationships.\n\nThe author's argument is based on the technical fact of their past relationship. However, in many cases, trans people prefer that others use their current names and pronouns, and refer to them in the context of their current gender identity. This is about respecting their identity and how they wish to be perceived. Even if the relationship occurred before transition, using past terms can be seen as invalidating their current identity. \n\nThe acquaintance's reaction suggests that this is a sensitive issue. The author might not have considered that Dan might prefer to be seen as an ex-boyfriend now, even though the relationship was in the past. While Dan didn't seem offended, that doesn't necessarily mean the term is acceptable. It's possible Dan is trying to avoid conflict, but the acquaintance's strong reaction indicates a broader social expectation.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to be factually accurate, the more important aspect is respecting Dan's current identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not using the term that aligns with Dan's current identity, regardless of the past. The answer should be A.\n"
