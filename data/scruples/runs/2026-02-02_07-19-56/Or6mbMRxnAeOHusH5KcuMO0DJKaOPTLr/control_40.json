We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a former relationship where the ex is transitioning from female to male. The author refers to them as their ex-girlfriend, which the mutual acquaintance objects to, calling them an ex-boyfriend instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the person's identity. Since Dan is transitioning, they might prefer being referred to in their current gender. However, the author is pointing out that when they were in the relationship, Dan was still Kate, so they were dating as a girl. The author isn't using Dan's name here, so maybe the confusion comes from the pronouns and titles used.\n\nBut the key point here is the mutual acquaintance's reaction. The user is confused because Dan didn't seem offended, but the friend was. So, who's right here? Transgender individuals often prefer to be referred to by their current identity and pronouns. Even if the relationship occurred in the past when they were a different gender, using past labels might be seen as misgendering them. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to explain the dynamic of their past relationship. They might be using \"ex-girlfriend\" to clarify the context of the relationship, not to refer to Dan's current identity. But in doing so, they might be using outdated terms that don't align with Dan's current identity. \n\nThe mutual acquaintance argued that Dan is an ex-boyfriend now. So, the conflict is between the past relationship and present identity. The author's explanation is that during the relationship, Dan was a girl, but the acquaintance is focusing on Dan's current identity. \n\nIn many cases, the trans community prefers to be referred to by their current names and pronouns, even when discussing past relationships. Using past terms might be seen as invalidating their current identity. However, in some contexts, people might explain the relationship by acknowledging the past, especially if it's necessary for clarity. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" is appropriate. The author isn't misgendering Dan, as Dan is using his name and the acquaintance's issue is with the title. But the title might be problematic because it refers to Dan's past gender, not his current identity. \n\nIf Dan himself isn't offended, that might suggest that the author isn't in the wrong. But the mutual acquaintance's reaction is based on the belief that the title should reflect Dan's current identity. The author's reasoning is that the term \"ex-girlfriend\" accurately describes the relationship as it was, but the acquaintance sees it as incorrect because Dan is now male.\n\nThis is a nuanced situation. The author might not be in the wrong if they're being honest about the past relationship, but they could also be expected to use Dan's current identity in present-day contexts. However, when explaining a past relationship, it's sometimes necessary to reference how the person was at that time. The key is whether the term is used in a way that respects Dan's identity now. \n\nSince Dan didn't object, it's possible that he finds it acceptable to talk about the past in that way. The mutual acquaintance might be overstepping by enforcing current identity on past contexts. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. But there's also a case that using current terms is better to honor Dan's identity now. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're explaining the past relationship accurately, and Dan himself isn't offended. The acquaintance's objection might be based on misunderstanding the context of the relationship.\n"
