We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves referring to their ex transgender partner as an ex-girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is a trans man (FtM) who transitioned after the relationship ended. The author's current name is Dan, but he was previously known as Kate. The original poster (OP) dated Dan when he was transitioning or after, but the relationship started when he was presenting as female. Now, the OP refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend, which caused some conflict with a mutual acquaintance.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and respect. Transgender individuals often have specific pronouns and names they prefer. Even if the relationship occurred when the person was presenting as a different gender, the individual's current identity is what matters. The term \"ex-girlfriend\" might not align with Dan's current gender identity. Even though the relationship was in the past, using the past gender label could be seen as invalidating his current identity.\n\nThe acquaintance's reaction suggests that using the term \"ex-girlfriend\" is problematic. It's possible that the acquaintance is advocating for respecting Dan's current identity rather than the past one. Dan didn't seem offended, but that doesn't necessarily mean the term is acceptable. People might not always show offense, especially if they feel it's not worth the confrontation.\n\nThe OP's rationale is that it's factually accurate since the relationship happened when Dan was a girl. However, in the trans community, the focus is more on the person's affirmed gender identity now rather than past gender expressions. Using the past label could be considered misgendering, even if it's in the context of a past relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on whether the term \"ex-girlfriend\" is respectful to Dan's current identity. Since the acquaintance was offended and the trans community often emphasizes current identity, the author might be in the wrong by using a term that doesn't align with Dan's current gender.\n"
