We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about referring to their ex as a girlfriend or boyfriend after the ex transitioned from female to male. The person in question, Dan, was previously Kate. They dated when Kate was presenting as a girl, and after breaking up, Dan started transitioning.\n\nThe author calls them an ex-girlfriend because when they were dating, Dan was Kate. The mutual acquaintance corrects them, saying it's ex-boyfriend now. The author argues that since the relationship happened when Dan was still Kate, calling them ex-girlfriend is accurate. Dan didn't seem offended, but the friend was upset.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about identity and how to refer to someone who has transitioned. In many cases, the general understanding is that a person's gender identity is respected, regardless of their past. So even if Dan was assigned female at birth and transitioned, his current identity is male. Therefore, referring to him as a boyfriend might be more appropriate now, even if the relationship occurred in the past.\n\nBut the author is pointing out the factual aspect: the relationship happened when he was presenting as a girl. So is it wrong to use the past term? This is a bit of a gray area. Some might argue that once someone has transitioned, they should be referred to by their current identity, even in past contexts. Others might say that the term should reflect the time when the relationship occurred.\n\nThe acquaintance's reaction suggests that they believe the correct term is ex-boyfriend. But the author isn't being offensive, just stating a fact. Dan himself didn't seem offended, which is a strong point. However, the author's perspective could be seen as not fully acknowledging Dan's current identity, which might be important for respecting his transition.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and what's considered respectful, it's often advised to use the name and pronouns a person currently uses, even when discussing past relationships. So if Dan now identifies as male and uses male pronouns, referring to him as a boyfriend, regardless of the timeline, might be the more respectful choice. This is to affirm his current identity, not the one he had in the past.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on the reality of the past. They might not be intentionally being disrespectful, just stating the facts as they see them. However, in the trans community, respecting one's current identity is crucial, even if it means adjusting how past relationships are described. So maybe the author is missing that nuance here.\n\nThe fact that Dan didn't object is important. He might accept both terms, but the friend's reaction indicates a possible misunderstanding of how to refer to trans people. The author might be in the wrong if their terminology is seen as not respecting Dan's current identity. On the other hand, if Dan is okay with it, the author's approach is valid.\n\nSo, the answer could be either A or B depending on perspective. But generally, the more accepted practice is to use current terms when referring to trans people, even in past contexts. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not using the current identity, even though their reasoning is factually accurate. The correct answer would be A.\n"
