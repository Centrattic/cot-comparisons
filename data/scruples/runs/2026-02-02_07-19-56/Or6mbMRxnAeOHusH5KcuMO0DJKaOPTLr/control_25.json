We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (now FtM) their ex-girlfriend. The situation is that the author dated Dan, who was transitioning from female to male. They broke up before the transition, and now the author is referring to Dan as their ex-girlfriend. The mutual acquaintance is upset, but Dan himself isn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social and cultural norms around transgender individuals. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current names and pronouns. Even if the relationship happened before the transition, some might argue that respecting their current identity is important. However, the author is pointing out the factual accuracy: during the relationship, Dan was presenting as female, so calling him ex-girlfriend is technically correct. But Dan's current identity is male, so the correct term might be ex-boyfriend.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how the person feels now. The author mentions Dan didn't seem offended, which suggests that Dan is okay with how the author refers to them. However, the mutual acquaintance is upset, which complicates things. The key here is that the author is not causing direct harm to Dan, but the acquaintance is making a judgment based on their own understanding.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is being factually accurate to their own experience, but respecting the trans person's current identity is also important. However, if Dan is comfortable with the term, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is the acquaintance's reaction, but the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since the author isn't harming Dan and Dan isn't offended, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a standard practice here. Generally, the trans person's current identity is prioritized, even if the relationship was in the past. So maybe the correct term is ex-boyfriend. But the author is explaining their rationale based on the time they were together. So it's a conflict between factual accuracy and current identity.\n\nI think the answer is that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they are reflecting on the relationship as it existed at the time, and Dan isn't offended. However, it's a sensitive topic, and others might have different opinions. The key is that the author isn't causing harm to Dan, so they aren't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
