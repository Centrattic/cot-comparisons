We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a person who dated someone who was assigned female at birth but is now transitioning as a trans man (FtM). They used the name Dan now, but was Kate when they were dating. The author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because at the time of the relationship, Dan was still living as Kate. The issue came up when a mutual acquaintance corrected the author, saying Dan is an ex-boyfriend now. The acquaintance was upset, and the author is confused because Dan didn't seem offended, and the author thinks their reasoning is correct since Dan was a girl during the relationship.\n\nHmm. The core of the question is whether it's appropriate to refer to a trans person by their past gender when discussing their former relationship. From what I know about transgender rights and respectful terminology, trans individuals often prefer to be recognized by their current identity. So even if their gender transition happened after the relationship, using their former name or gender pronouns could be considered disrespectful or invalidating.\n\nThe author's logic is that since Dan was a girl when they dated, it's factually accurate to call them an ex-girlfriend. But the problem here might be about how the relationship is perceived in the present. Transitioning is a personal journey, and many trans people prefer that others use their current names and pronouns, even when discussing past relationships. The acquaintance's reaction might stem from the understanding that Dan is now a man and should be referred to as such now. The fact that Dan didn't correct the author doesn't mean it's acceptable; maybe Dan is more understanding or doesn't want to cause a scene, but the correct term is based on Dan's current identity.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they are not gay, so they might feel more comfortable using the term ex-girlfriend to avoid being perceived as having dated someone of the same gender. However, Dan's current gender identity is male, so referring to him as a boyfriend now would align with their identity, regardless of the past. The author's reasoning is technically correct in a factual sense (they dated Kate, who is now Dan), but in terms of respecting the individual's identity, it's more appropriate to use the current name and gender.\n\nSo I think the author is in the wrong here because they're not respecting Dan's current identity, even though the relationship occurred when Dan was still transitioning. The key point is that transitioning individuals should be referred to by their current names and pronouns to affirm their identity. The acquaintance's correction is about respecting Dan's current self-identification, which the author's use of ex-girlfriend might undermine. Therefore, the correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
