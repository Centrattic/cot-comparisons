We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend an ex-boyfriend now that she's transitioning to male.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person (let's say OP) dated someone who was assigned female at birth (FtM), and they broke up before the transition. Now, the ex has transitioned, and the OP refers to them as an ex-girlfriend because when they dated, the person was female. However, a mutual acquaintance gets upset and insists it should be ex-boyfriend now. The ex, Dan, didn't seem offended, but the friend was.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? Let me break it down. The key points here are about identity, social norms, and respect for the person's current identity versus the past relationship.\n\nIn the trans community, it's generally considered important to use the correct pronouns and titles that reflect their current identity. However, this person is asking if the past relationship's title should be adjusted based on the current identity. For example, if someone transitioned after the relationship ended, does referring to them as a past ex with their previous gender label cause harm?\n\nThe user argues that since the relationship occurred when the person was female, calling them ex-girlfriend is factually accurate. The friend, however, argues that since Dan is now male, even in the past context, he should be called ex-boyfriend. The friend might be under the impression that using the current identity changes the past relationship's context.\n\nBut Dan didn't seem offended, so maybe the issue is more about the mutual acquaintance's perspective. The user's reasoning is that the relationship happened in the past when Dan was female. So using the past label makes sense. However, some might argue that using the current identity in present context is more respectful, even when discussing the past.\n\nI think the key here is that the person Dan is the one who should decide. Since Dan didn't show any offense, maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But if the user is using a label that Dan might find uncomfortable, even if he didn't say anything, that could be a problem. However, the user is not the one who transitioned, so they might not be the one to police the terminology. The mutual friend's reaction could be overstepping as well, assuming they know what Dan wants.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a balance between respecting the person's current identity and the historical context of the relationship. The user might be factually correct in their reasoning, but the social expectation might be to use the current identity's labels even when referring to the past relationship. However, since Dan didn't object, the user might not be in the wrong. The friend's reaction could be unnecessary.\n\nAnother angle: the user is not in a relationship with Dan anymore. The question is about how to refer to past relationships. If the person is now male, but the user was in a relationship when he was female, the user might feel it's accurate to call him ex-girlfriend. However, in some cases, trans individuals might prefer their past relationships to be acknowledged with their current identity to affirm their gender. But since Dan didn't show any offense, the user's approach might be acceptable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user's reasoning is factually sound, and since Dan wasn't offended, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mutual friend's reaction might stem from a misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
