We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling their ex-girlfriend (now FtM) as their ex-girlfriend.\n\nFirst, understanding the situation: The author dated someone, Dan, who was Kate at the time. They broke up, then Dan transitioned. The author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend because they were in a relationship when Dan was presenting as female. But a mutual acquaintance corrects the author, saying Dan is now an ex-boyfriend. The author's argument is that since the relationship happened when Dan was a girl, it's factually accurate to call it ex-girlfriend. Dan didn't seem offended, but the acquaintance was upset.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. Legally and factually, the relationship did occur under the gender identity that Dan had at the time. So in terms of truth, the author's statement is accurate. However, the key here is about respecting Dan's current identity. Transitioning individuals often prefer to be recognized by their current identity and pronouns. Even if the author is technically correct, using the past gender label might disregard Dan's current identity. The acquaintance's reaction might be based on the understanding that transitioning people often wish to be acknowledged in their current form, even when discussing past relationships. \n\nBut the author mentions that Dan didn't seem offended. That's important. If Dan himself is okay with being referred to as the author's ex-girlfriend, then maybe there's no issue. However, the mutual acquaintance's reaction suggests that there's a social norm or expectation to refer to trans individuals by their current identity, regardless of the past. \n\nThe author's perspective is based on factual accuracy, while the acquaintance is emphasizing respect for Dan's current identity. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is causing discomfort to Dan or others by not respecting his current identity, then they might be in the wrong. But if Dan is fine with it, maybe not. However, even if Dan isn't offended, the way the statement is phrased (\"back when he was a girl\") could be seen as invalidating his current identity. \n\nIn the trans community, the general advice is to use the name and pronouns that the person currently identifies with. So when referring to past relationships, it's often considered respectful to use the current name and pronouns, even if the relationship occurred before transition. That would imply that the correct term is \"ex-boyfriend\" now. \n\nBut the author is non-gender, so they might not have the same understanding. However, the fact that the acquaintance corrected them and Dan left quickly suggests that the way the author phrased it was hurtful or at least uncomfortable for Dan, even if he didn't say so directly. \n\nSo while the author's statement is factually accurate, it may not align with the social norms of respecting trans individuals' current identities. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering Dan's current identity in the way they refer to the past relationship. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
