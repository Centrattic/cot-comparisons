We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex a girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author dated someone when they were female (Kate) and they broke up. Later, the person transitioned to male (Dan). Now, the author refers to them as an ex-girlfriend because they were in a relationship when the person was female. The acquaintance corrected the author, saying Dan is now an ex-boyfriend. The author argues it's factually correct to call them an ex-girlfriend since the relationship was during Kate's time as a female, and Dan isn't offended. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. Trans people often prefer to be referred to by their current identity, regardless of past relationships. So even though the relationship happened when Dan was Kate, the current identity is male. Using past female pronouns and labels might be seen as invalidating Dan's transition. The author is using \"ex-girlfriend\" to reflect the past relationship, which technically is accurate, but might not align with Dan's current identity and preferences.\n\nThe acquaintance was offended, which suggests that using \"ex-girlfriend\" might be considered disrespectful or transphobic. Even if Dan isn't offended, others might be. The author's reasoning is logical from a factual standpoint, but in social contexts, respecting the person's current identity is crucial. Transphobia often involves ignoring someone's transition, so referring to them by their past gender could be seen as a form of that. \n\nHowever, the author is trying to clarify the nature of the relationship accurately. If the relationship was with Kate, then technically the ex-girlfriend term is correct. But the trans community's standards might prioritize current identity over past relationships. The author's intention wasn't to be disrespectful, but the impact on the acquaintance was negative. It's a tricky situation between factual accuracy and social sensitivity.\n\nI think the author's mistake lies in not considering that trans people often want their current identity respected, even in past contexts. So using \"ex-girlfriend\" might be seen as clinging to the past identity. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't prioritize Dan's current identity, even if they think it's factually correct. The correct approach would be to refer to Dan as an ex-boyfriend, acknowledging his transition and current identity.\n"
