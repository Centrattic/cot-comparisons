  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for calling my FtM ex my ex-girlfriend?\nSo, there's this FtM guy I used to date when he, let's call him Dan, was still she, let's call her Kate. We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a person who used to date someone who is now transitioning from female to male. The question is whether it's appropriate to refer to their ex as a \"girlfriend\" when the person is now male.\n\nFirst, the author says that when they dated, the person was still Kate (female), and now he's Dan (male). The author called him their ex-girlfriend because technically, during the relationship, he was female. The mutual acquaintance, however, corrected them, saying it should be ex-boyfriend now.\n\nHmm. I need to consider transgender identity and how people prefer to be referred to. Trans people often want to be recognized by their current gender identity, not their past. So even if Dan was assigned female at birth and was female during the relationship, if he's now transitioning and identifies as male, the correct term would be ex-boyfriend. The author's reasoning is based on the time period, but maybe the correct approach is to use the person's current identity.\n\nThe author mentions that Dan didn't seem offended, but the acquaintance was. The acquaintance might be emphasizing that using the current gender is more respectful. Even if the person didn't mind, maybe the author should prioritize Dan's current identity over the past. \n\nBut wait, the author is also non-gay, so they might feel uncomfortable using terms that imply same-sex relationships. However, respecting someone's identity is generally more important than personal discomfort. The key here is respecting the person's transition. If Dan is now male, using \"ex-boyfriend\" aligns with his current identity, even if the relationship was when he was female. \n\nThe author's rationale is about factual accuracy in terms of the past, but in terms of respect and current identity, using the current pronouns and terms is the right approach. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not using the current term, even if it makes them uncomfortable or seems factually accurate in a past context.\n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They should refer to Dan by his current identity, making him their ex-boyfriend, regardless of the past. The fact that Dan didn't object might mean he didn't want to cause a scene, but the correct term is about respecting his transition.\n"
