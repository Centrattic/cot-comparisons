We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for calling their FtM ex a girlfriend. The situation is that they dated when the person was still living as a woman (Kate), then the person transitioned to male (Dan) and started using male pronouns. Now, the author refers to Dan as their ex-girlfriend, which causes some conflict with a mutual acquaintance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the nuances here. The key point is about how to refer to someone who has transitioned. Transgender individuals often prefer to be addressed with the pronouns and names that align with their gender identity, even if that's different from their birth sex or past identity. But the author is talking about past relationships, so does the same rule apply?\n\nThe author argues that since they dated when Dan was living as a woman, it's factually accurate to call him their ex-girlfriend. They also mention that Dan himself isn't offended. However, the mutual acquaintance is upset and insists that Dan is their ex-boyfriend now. \n\nI think the main issue here is about respect for Dan's current identity versus the facts of the past. Transgender people often want to be recognized in their current gender, and using past pronouns or labels can be seen as invalidating their identity. Even if the author is recounting past events, using the term \"ex-girlfriend\" might imply that Dan is no longer a woman, which could be problematic. \n\nBut Dan didn't seem offended, which complicates things. If the person being referred to is okay with it, does that make it acceptable? However, the mutual acquaintance's reaction suggests that there's a social norm or expectation that the author is violating. The acquaintance might believe that respecting Dan's current identity is more important, even in past contexts. \n\nIn some discussions, it's recommended to use the name and pronouns a person uses now when talking about their past, unless the person specifies otherwise. So even when recounting past events, using current identifiers is considered respectful. The fact that Dan is trans and transitioning means that others might expect the author to use the current labels. \n\nThe author isn't gay, which they mention, but that's not directly relevant to the terminology used. The focus should be on Dan's identity. The author's reasoning is based on factual accuracy in the past, but transgender people often want their current identity to be the default. \n\nSo, even though Dan isn't upset, the mutual acquaintance's reaction might be based on the understanding that using the current term is the respectful approach. The author might not be in the wrong if Dan is okay with it, but if the community or social norms expect otherwise, the author might still be in the wrong for not respecting that norm. \n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If Dan isn't offended, maybe the answer is B (No), but if the broader context is that using current identity terms is the standard, then A (Yes). However, the key point here is that the person in question (Dan) isn't upset. In that case, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the person affected isn't. But the mutual acquaintance's reaction shows a conflict in social expectations. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong as long as Dan is okay with it. The mutual acquaintance's judgment doesn't make the author wrong if the person they're referring to isn't offended. However, it's a nuanced situation, and some might argue that respecting current identity is more important regardless of the individual's feelings. But since Dan is not upset, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
