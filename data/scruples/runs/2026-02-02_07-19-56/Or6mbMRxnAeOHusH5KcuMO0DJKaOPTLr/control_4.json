We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for referring to their ex as an ex-girlfriend after the person transitioned. The situation is a bit complex because the ex was assigned female at birth but started transitioning after the relationship ended.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person they dated, Dan, used to be Kate. They dated when Dan was presenting as a girl (Kate), then Dan transitioned after the breakup. The author refers to him as an ex-girlfriend because, during the relationship, Dan was a girl. The mutual acquaintance took offense, saying Dan should be called an ex-boyfriend now.\n\nThe key points here are about identity and terminology. Transitioning individuals may have different preferences regarding how they're referred to, especially in past relationships. Even though Dan is now male, the relationship happened when he was female. But the acquaintance's argument is that since Dan is now male, the relationship should be referred to in the context of his current identity. However, the user argues that since the relationship was with Kate/Dan when they were female, it's factually accurate to call it an ex-girlfriend.\n\nI need to think about trans issues here. Trans people often prefer to be referred to with their current identity, but when talking about past relationships, it's possible that the terms might still be based on the person's gender at the time. However, there's a balance between factual accuracy and respecting the person's current identity. The user isn't gay, so using \"ex-girlfriend\" aligns their identity as a straight person, but trans people might prefer that the relationship be acknowledged in the context of their gender transition.\n\nBut the user mentions that Dan didn't seem offended. That's a crucial point. If the person Dan himself is comfortable with being referred to as an ex-girlfriend, then the user isn't wrong. The main complaint is from the acquaintance, not Dan. The user's reasoning is that since Dan was a girl during the relationship, it's accurate to use that term. However, the acquaintance's reaction suggests a different perspective, possibly that the relationship should now be referred to in the context of Dan's current identity as a male.\n\nIn trans communities, it's often emphasized to respect the person's current identity and preferred pronouns. But when referring to past relationships, there's a gray area. Some might argue that using the term based on the person's gender at the time is acceptable, especially if they themselves are okay with it. Others might believe that using the current gender is more respectful, even if it changes the relationship's descriptor.\n\nThe fact that Dan didn't object is a strong point in the user's favor. The user might not be in the wrong if Dan agrees with their terminology. The issue here is the acquaintance's judgment, not Dan's. The user isn't intentionally disrespecting Dan; they're trying to remain truthful to their own experience and identity by not being gay. However, the user could have considered asking Dan how he prefers to be referred to in such contexts, but since Dan didn't mind, it's probably okay.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong because they're using terminology that aligns with their experience and Dan's comfort. The acquaintance's objection might stem from a different perspective on trans issues but doesn't necessarily mean the user is wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
