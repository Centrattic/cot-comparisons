We dated a few weeks at the beginning of the school year, and a few months after we broke up, he came out as trans and started transitioning.\n\nThis led to a mindscrew for me. Referring to him in conversation when I'm not using his name, would I can him my ex gf or my ex bf? Technically he's a guy now, but I'm not gay, and while dating him he was still a girl. So technically speaking I feel it's factually accurate to call him my 'ex gf'.\n\nSo, at school we have a class together with a mutual acquaintance. This acquaintance, who didn't know we used to date, asked how we knew each other. I said, 'dan used to be my girlfriend back when he was a girl'. Dan didn't seem offended or anything. But this acquaintance definitely was. He told me Dan is my *ex-boyfriend*, not my ex-girlfriend. Dan, who I know doesn't really like debates or arguments that much, made an excuse to basically leave. \n\nSo this acquaintance kind of yelled at me, and I explained my rationale: back when dan dated me, he was still she, so it doesn't make sense to refer to her as a ex boyfriend. Also, he's not offended at all, so I don't see why this acquaintance is.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for referring to their FtM ex as an ex-girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person dated Dan when he was Kate, identifying as female. After they broke up, Dan transitioned and started living as male. The author uses \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how they knew Dan when they were in a relationship. The issue came up when a mutual acquaintance corrected them, saying Dan is now a boyfriend, not a girlfriend, and the acquaintance was upset. Dan himself didn't seem offended.\n\nSo, what's the core of the problem here? It's about how to refer to someone's past gender identity when they're now in a different gender. The author thinks it's factually accurate because their relationship was when Dan was presenting as female. The acquaintance disagrees, arguing that since Dan is now male, the term should be \"ex-boyfriend.\"\n\nI need to consider trans rights and societal norms. Transitioning individuals often prefer to be recognized by their current gender identity. This includes names, pronouns, and other identifiers. However, in this case, the author isn't using the current gender for the relationship term because the relationship was in the past when the person was a different gender. \n\nBut wait, does the term \"ex-girlfriend\" or \"ex-boyfriend\" depend on the time when the relationship existed? If the person transitioned after the relationship ended, technically, the relationship was as a female. So, the term \"ex-girlfriend\" would be accurate from a factual standpoint. However, there's also the social aspect: some people might argue that using the past gender could be seen as invalidating the person's current identity. But since Dan isn't offended, maybe that's not the case here.\n\nThe key points are Dan's reaction versus the acquaintance's. The acquaintance is the one who got upset, not Dan. The author is following Dan's current preference (using his name, Dan) but using the past relationship term. However, the acquaintance's objection is based on Dan's current gender, not the past. \n\nFrom a trans-inclusive perspective, it's important to respect the person's current identity. But the author is referring to a past relationship, so maybe it's acceptable. But there's a line here. If the person has undergone legal or social transition, some might argue that the relationship should be referred to using current terms to respect their lived experience. However, others might say that the relationship's context is part of the history and should be acknowledged as such.\n\nAnother angle: The author isn't denying Dan's current identity. They use his current name and know he's male now. The issue is about the term for the past relationship. If the acquaintance is correct in saying that the ex is a \"boyfriend\" because Dan is now male, but the author is correct in saying it was a \"girlfriend\" because the relationship was when Dan was female. \n\nThis seems like a matter of perspective. The author isn't being intentionally transphobic. They are stating a fact about their past relationship. The acquaintance is enforcing current identity onto past relationships, which might not be appropriate. The fact that Dan didn't react negatively suggests that he's comfortable with how the author refers to the relationship.\n\nBut maybe the acquaintance is right in a way. If the term should reflect the person's current identity, then perhaps \"ex-boyfriend\" is more appropriate. However, that might not account for the history. It's a tricky balance. The author's use of \"ex-girlfriend\" is factual in the context of the relationship's timeline. The problem arises when the acquaintance imposes their own view, which may not align with Dan's feelings.\n\nSince Dan is the one who transitioned and the author is using the correct name and current gender for Dan, but the term for the past relationship is a point of contention. The author isn't wrong for using \"ex-girlfriend\" because that's how the relationship was at the time. The acquaintance's objection might stem from a misunderstanding or a strict application of current identity to past relationships, which isn't always necessary.\n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. They are accurately describing the relationship as it existed in the past, and since Dan isn't offended, it's acceptable. The wrong here would be if the author was using deadnames or misgendering Dan in the present, which they aren't. The term \"ex-girlfriend\" is about the past context, which is valid.\n"
