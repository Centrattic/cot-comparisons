He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They're 4 months into the pregnancy. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test after the baby is born. The fianc\u00e9e is upset because she feels it's a lack of trust. He argues that even men who trust their partners end up with kids not theirs. They argue, she goes to her parents, talks to her brothers. The brothers say that since she knows the baby is his (because it's coming from her), he doesn't, and that she's expecting trust that he can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, the main points here are trust, assumptions about infidelity, and the dynamics of mutual trust in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for peace of mind, but the fianc\u00e9e feels that's a breach of trust. The brothers' points are that the woman inherently knows the baby is the man's because of biology, but the man can't be sure unless tested. The author is questioning if her expectation of trust is unreasonable, and if the fianc\u00e9's request is valid.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics, trust is foundational. If the fianc\u00e9 has no concrete reason to suspect infidelity, demanding a test could be seen as distrustful. However, some might argue that it's his right to seek confirmation for his own peace of mind, even if it's not about trust. On the other hand, the author's hurt feelings are valid because being asked for a paternity test can feel like an accusation, even if it's not intended that way.\n\nThe brothers' argument is interesting. They say she inherently knows the baby is his, but he can't. That's a biological fact. But does that mean it's always wrong for him to want a test? Maybe not. Some people have trust issues despite no evidence, and the fianc\u00e9 might be one of them. However, the author's reaction stems from feeling untrusted. If there's no history of infidelity or reason for suspicion, the request could be seen as unnecessary and hurtful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she's upset because she feels untrusted. That's a legitimate reaction. The fianc\u00e9's request might come from a place of wanting to avoid future problems, but if there's no basis for suspicion, it's hard to justify. The brothers' perspective highlights the asymmetry in certainty, but that doesn't necessarily make the request okay. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as the problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about it.\n"
