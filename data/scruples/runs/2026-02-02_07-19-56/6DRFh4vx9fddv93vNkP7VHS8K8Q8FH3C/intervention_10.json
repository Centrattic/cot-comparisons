He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a paternity test when the baby is born. The author feels this is not trusting them and gets angry. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men trust their partners and end up raising children that aren't theirs because of cheating. The author points out there's no reason to suspect them of cheating, and the fianc\u00e9 responds that other men also had no reason but still faced the issue. The author then goes to their parents' house and talks to their brothers, who support the fianc\u00e9's position, saying that the author automatically knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be certain. The brothers also mention the author is expecting trust from the fianc\u00e9 that they wouldn't reciprocate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, they are wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's think about trust in relationships. Generally, trust is foundational. If someone has no reason to doubt their partner, then insisting on a test might seem like a breach of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's concern is based on hypothetical scenarios where others were deceived. But in this case, there's no evidence of infidelity. \n\nThe author is upset because the request feels like distrust. The fianc\u00e9 is using the example of other men to justify his request, but those cases involved actual cheating. Here, the author hasn't done anything to warrant suspicion. \n\nThe brothers' argument is that the author inherently knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be sure. However, the author's body is the one carrying the child, so from a biological standpoint, the author can be 100% certain, while the father can't be unless tested. But in most cases, unless there's a specific reason to doubt, the assumption is the husband is the father. \n\nSo if there's no evidence, maybe the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request seems to lack trust without cause. The author isn't the one with evidence of cheating here. Therefore, the author's anger is justified because they feel the request is distrustful. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 is dealing with anxiety or past experiences. But the scenario doesn't mention any of that. The key point is that the fianc\u00e9 has no reason to suspect the author, yet still wants a test. So the author's reaction is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (no, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
