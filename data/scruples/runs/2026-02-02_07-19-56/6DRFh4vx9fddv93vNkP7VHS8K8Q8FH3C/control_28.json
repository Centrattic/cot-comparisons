He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's four months pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn child. She feels he doesn't trust her, which makes her angry. He argues that even if he trusts her, he doesn't want to risk raising another man's child, citing others who've been in similar situations. She goes to her parents, and her brothers agree that she knows the baby is hers because it's hers, but he can't know that. One brother even says she's expecting a level of trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust and differing perspectives. She feels he's not trusting her, while he's trying to protect himself from a potential situation that's out of both their control. From a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If he's asking for a paternity test, he's essentially expressing a lack of trust in her fidelity. But on the other hand, he's also trying to avoid a scenario where he's raising a child that isn't his, which is a valid concern for some men, though it's a personal choice.\n\nHer anger is about feeling disrespected or untrusting. However, his request might stem from fear or past experiences, even if there's no actual suspicion. The brothers' comments suggest that the man's inability to have the same certainty as the woman leads to this conflict. The woman can be certain of her own actions, but he can't have the same certainty without the test.\n\nBut in a healthy relationship, trust is supposed to be given without needing proof. If he can't trust her without evidence, that might indicate issues in their relationship. On the other hand, expecting him to trust her without any assurance might be unrealistic if he's not a trusting person. However, the fact that there's no reason to suspect infidelity complicates things. His request seems to be based on fear rather than any real evidence, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting trust. If she's faithful, then his request is based on not trusting her. But if he's just being cautious, maybe there's a middle ground. However, in the absence of any suspicion, his request could be seen as a lack of trust. Therefore, the author's anger might be justified because she's feeling that he doesn't trust her, even if there's no reason to doubt her. The answer might hinge on whether trust is supposed to be blind or if the fianc\u00e9 is within his rights to want assurance. But in most cases, trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, and asking for a paternity test without any suspicion could be seen as the fianc\u00e9's issue. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
