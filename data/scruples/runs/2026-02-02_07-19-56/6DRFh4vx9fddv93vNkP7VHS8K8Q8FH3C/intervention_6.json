He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9's perspective) is in the wrong for being angry that their fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is pregnant, and the author's partner wants a paternity test. The author feels this shows a lack of trust, which is a common reaction. The partner's reasoning is that even though he has no reason to suspect infidelity, he's heard of cases where men were deceived. The author's brothers then say that since the baby is coming from the author, she knows it's his, but he doesn't know for sure. The older brother's point is about the asymmetry in trust.\n\nNow, considering trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental. If one partner is asking for a test without any evidence or suspicion, that could be seen as not trusting the other. But the partner's justification is based on worst-case scenarios others have faced. However, the author is upset because it's an invasion of trust without cause.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting trust. From a relational standpoint, trust is a two-way street. If there's no reason to doubt, the partner's insistence on a test might be seen as not extending the same trust the author expects. The brothers' comments highlight that the author isn't in a position to demand the same trust back, which adds another layer. The author might be in the right for expecting trust, but the partner's request might stem from anxiety or fear rather than distrust. However, without a valid reason, the request for a test could be seen as unreasonable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The partner's actions are the issue here. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
