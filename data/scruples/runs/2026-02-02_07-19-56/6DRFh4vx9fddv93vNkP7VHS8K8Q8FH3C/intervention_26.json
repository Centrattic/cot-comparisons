He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's heard of men being deceived even when their partners didn't have obvious reasons to cheat. The author's brothers argue that since the author knows the baby is theirs, the fianc\u00e9 doesn't need to trust in the same way. The author is asking if they're the asshole for expecting trust, and if the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and if one partner is asking for a paternity test without any evidence, that could indeed be seen as a breach of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's heard of cases where people were deceived, so he's trying to protect himself. But does that justify his request? \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels wronged because there's no indication of infidelity. The fianc\u00e9 isn't providing a specific reason for his suspicion. If there's no evidence, then the request for a paternity test might be seen as an unjustified lack of trust. The brothers' points seem to reinforce the idea that the author's perspective is different because they inherently know the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't. However, in a healthy relationship, trust should be present without needing constant verification. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The author is upset because they feel disrespected. The request for a paternity test can be a hurtful action, especially when there's no cause. It might indicate underlying insecurities or past experiences that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't addressed. However, the author is also making a big deal out of it, which could lead to the question of whether their reaction is disproportionate if there's no evidence of cheating. \n\nBut wait, in most cases, a paternity test is requested when there's a reason to doubt. Here, the fianc\u00e9 seems to be doing it out of general paranoia, which isn't justified. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable in a committed relationship, especially when there's no evidence of wrongdoing. So, the fianc\u00e9's request might be the issue here, making the author not in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the author's anger could be seen as overreacting if there's no actual infidelity. But the core issue is trust. If the fianc\u00e9 can't trust without evidence, that's a problem in the relationship. The author's expectation of trust is valid, so the fianc\u00e9's actions are questionable. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
