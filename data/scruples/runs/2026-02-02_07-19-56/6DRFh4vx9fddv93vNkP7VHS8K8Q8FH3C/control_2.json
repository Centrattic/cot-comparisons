He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child. The author is upset because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have been deceived before.\n\nSo, the main question is about trust versus the need for certainty. The author's brother points out that the author knows the baby is theirs because they're the one carrying it, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't have that same certainty. That's a key point. The brothers argue that the author is expecting trust from the fianc\u00e9 that they themselves don't have to provide.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. However, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from a place of fear or past experiences where people were betrayed without any signs. The author might feel that since there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the request is unwarranted. But the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that without proof, he can't be certain, which is understandable from a personal security angle.\n\nIs it reasonable for him to want a paternity test? That depends on the context. If there's no evidence of cheating, some might see it as unnecessary. But others might say that it's his right to be sure, especially if he's worried about the child's paternity affecting future relationships or his role as a father.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid because they feel disrespected. However, the fianc\u00e9's need for assurance isn't inherently wrong either. The problem might be communication. The author might be expecting trust without providing the same level of trust to the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The brothers' argument highlights that mutual trust might require both parties to have confidence in each other's honesty, but in this case, the asymmetry in certainty exists.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling disrespected, but the fianc\u00e9's request is also a valid concern. However, since the author is the one questioning their own actions and the fianc\u00e9's request is based on a lack of evidence, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
