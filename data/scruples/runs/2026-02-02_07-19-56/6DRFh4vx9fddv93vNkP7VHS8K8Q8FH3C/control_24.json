He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is angry about it, feeling it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he has no reason to suspect cheating, he's heard of cases where men were duped, so he wants a test for his own peace of mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is upset because they feel their trust is being questioned. Trust is a big part of any relationship, so expecting their partner to trust them without a reason makes sense. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's desire for a paternity test might stem from fear or past experiences. He might be trying to protect himself from a potentially painful situation. \n\nThe brothers' comments add another angle. They argue that the author knows the baby is theirs because they're the one carrying it, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be sure. The older brother's point about mutual trust is interesting. The author might be holding the fianc\u00e9 to a standard they themselves can't meet, but that's a bit abstract. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, trust is usually a two-way street. The author is justified in feeling hurt if there's no evidence of wrongdoing. However, the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test could be seen as a way to ensure his own peace of mind, even if it's not the most trusting approach. \n\nI need to think about societal norms and relationship dynamics. While the author's feelings are valid, the fianc\u00e9's request isn't entirely unreasonable if he's genuinely anxious. However, the way the request was made and the lack of trust expressed could be a bigger issue. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting trust. The fianc\u00e9's request might be more about his own insecurities rather than mistrusting the author. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer likely depends on whether the expectation of trust is reasonable. Since the author hasn't done anything to warrant suspicion, expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test without cause could be seen as a breach of trust. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
