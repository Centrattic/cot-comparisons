He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is upset because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that other men have been deceived even when trusting their partners.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels hurt because their partner isn't trusting them, especially since they have no reason to suspect infidelity. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is worried about potentially raising a child that isn't biologically his, which is a common concern for some people.\n\nThe brothers' opinions add another layer. They suggest that the author can be 100% sure the baby is theirs (since it's their body), but the fianc\u00e9 can't. The brother's point is about mutual trust and the asymmetry in certainty between the two partners. This is a classic issue in relationships where one partner might feel that their trust isn't being reciprocated equally.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting trust. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship. If the author hasn't done anything to warrant suspicion, the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test could be seen as a breach of trust. However, some people have different thresholds for what they consider reasonable precautions. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that even without suspicion, some men have been deceived, so he wants to avoid that possibility. \n\nBut expecting trust is reasonable. If there's no evidence or reason to doubt, the request for a paternity test might be seen as an overreaction. The key here is whether the author has given any reason for mistrust. Since they don't, the fianc\u00e9's request could be perceived as not based on facts but on fear or insecurity. \n\nThe argument about mutual trust is important. If the author is expected to trust the fianc\u00e9 without question, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't reciprocate that trust, it creates an imbalance. The brothers' points highlight this asymmetry. The author's right to feel trusted is valid here.\n\nHowever, paternity tests are a personal choice. Some people might feel that their well-being and identity are tied to knowing their biological child. The fianc\u00e9's decision might be more about his own needs rather than a lack of trust in the author. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting trust, but the fianc\u00e9's request isn't entirely unreasonable from his perspective. However, in the absence of any evidence, the request could be seen as a lack of trust. The answer depends on cultural or personal norms, but generally, expecting trust is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
