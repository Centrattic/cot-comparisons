He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he has no reason to suspect infidelity, he mentions other men who trusted their partners and ended up raising someone else's child. The author's brothers side with the fianc\u00e9, saying that the author is asking for trust that the fianc\u00e9 can't reciprocate since the author knows for sure the baby is theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels the request is a breach of trust. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship, so expecting trust without reason might be reasonable. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is worried about the possibility of not being the biological father, which is a valid concern for some people. The author's brothers argue that the author can be certain of paternity because they can feel the baby's presence, but that's not a scientific certainty. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on his own uncertainty and fear, which he might not be able to control.\n\nThe key points here are whether the fianc\u00e9's request is justified and if the author is wrong to expect trust. The author might be right in feeling disrespected, but the fianc\u00e9's anxiety is a real issue. However, without any indication of infidelity, the request could be seen as a lack of trust. But some people might argue that the fianc\u00e9 is just being cautious. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In many cases, partners are expected to trust each other unless there's a reason not to. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning that others have been betrayed without any signs might not hold up if there's no evidence here. The author's brothers' points about the asymmetry of knowledge (author knows, not the male) might be a factor. However, the fianc\u00e9's inability to know without a test is a genuine problem for him. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is expecting trust without any cause, maybe not. The fianc\u00e9's request, while understandable, could be seen as unreasonable if there's no basis for suspicion. The author's reaction is about feeling untrusted, which is a valid emotional response. However, the fianc\u00e9's anxiety might stem from personal fears, not the author's actions. \n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, the person who demands proof without cause is often seen as the asshole. But if the person is genuinely anxious and trying to protect themselves, it's a gray area. The fact that the author's brothers support the fianc\u00e9 complicates it. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9's request is based on fear, not evidence. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on his own fears without any reason to doubt the author, which could be seen as unreasonable. The author's anger is a valid response to a lack of trust without justification. However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also understandable, but in the absence of any reason to suspect infidelity, the request is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
