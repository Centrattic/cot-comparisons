He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men have trusted their partners and ended up raising kids that aren't theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author feels that the request for a paternity test is a breach of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about potential infidelity, even without evidence. The author's brothers support her, saying she knows the baby is theirs since it's coming from her body, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be sure. The brother also mentions that the author is asking for trust that she can't reciprocate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by expecting trust. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If there's no evidence of infidelity, demanding a paternity test might be seen as distrustful. However, some people might argue that in the absence of trust, the test is a way to secure certainty. But typically, in a healthy relationship, trust is foundational. If the fianc\u00e9 has no reason to suspect cheating, then his request could be seen as undermining the trust that should exist. The author's anger is a valid reaction to feeling untrusted without cause.\n\nThe brothers' comments suggest that the author's position is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's stance might stem from personal fears or past experiences, but without evidence, it's hard to justify the lack of trust. The author isn't doing anything to warrant the test, so the expectation of trust is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
