He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The author feels this is a lack of trust. He argues that many men have been deceived despite trusting their partners. The author's brothers say that since the baby is coming from her body, he can't be sure unless tested. The author expects trust, but her brother says she's asking for a level of trust she can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, the key points here: Trust in relationships is usually mutual. If there's no evidence of infidelity, demanding a paternity test could be seen as not trusting her. On the other hand, he might be worried about possible scenarios, even if there's no reason to suspect her. But in a healthy relationship, trust is foundational. If there's no reason to doubt, then the request seems unfounded. The author's anger is justified because trust is a two-way street. If he can't trust her without evidence, that's an issue. The brothers' reasoning is a bit off because she can be certain about the baby's parentage if they're the only sexual partner, so his need for a test might be irrational. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She has a right to expect trust. His request without any suspicion could be the problem here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
