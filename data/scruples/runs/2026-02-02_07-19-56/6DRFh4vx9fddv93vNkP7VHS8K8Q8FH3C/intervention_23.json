He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a test for their unborn child, and the author feels it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even if there's no suspicion, some men have been duped before. The author's brothers say that the author knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be sure, hence the need for a test.\n\nHmm. Trust in a relationship is crucial. If there's no actual reason to suspect infidelity, then the request for a paternity test could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is worried about the possibility of not being the biological father, which is a valid concern for some people. But the author feels hurt and mistrusted, which makes sense. \n\nThe key points here are whether the fianc\u00e9's request is justified without any evidence and if the author has a right to expect trust. The brothers' input suggests that the author is asking for trust that the fianc\u00e9 can't reciprocate because he can't be 100% sure unless tested. But in most cases, people assume fidelity unless there's a reason to doubt. So if there's no suspicion, the fianc\u00e9's request might be unfounded. \n\nHowever, some people might feel differently. Maybe the fianc\u00e9 has past experiences or personal fears that make him want the test. But the author is justified in feeling hurt if there's no basis for the suspicion. So the question is whether the author is wrong for expecting trust. If there's no reason to distrust, then the author isn't the asshole. The fianc\u00e9's request is the issue here. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The fianc\u00e9 is overstepping by demanding a test without cause, and the author's anger is a valid response to being mistrusted without reason.\n"
