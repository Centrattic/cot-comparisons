He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully. The author is a woman who's four months pregnant with her fianc\u00e9's baby. He wants a paternity test when the child is born, which made her angry because she feels it's a lack of trust. He argues that other men have trusted their partners and later found out the child wasn't theirs. She responds that there's no reason to suspect her of cheating, and he replies that the other men didn't have one either. She left to cool down and talked to her brothers, who supported her, saying he should trust her.\n\nNow, the key points here: The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The author is upset because she sees this as a breach of trust. Her brothers' advice is that she can confirm the baby is hers because it's coming from her body, but he can't confirm his own. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting trust from her fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, then the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test could be seen as a lack of trust. But maybe the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns. People sometimes request tests due to past experiences, even if there's no current evidence. The author might feel this is unnecessary and hurtful, especially since she can't be certain of her own biology. Her brothers' point is that she can verify her own, but he can't without the test. \n\nBut is the request reasonable? Well, paternity tests are common in cases of doubt, and if the fianc\u00e9 has no grounds for suspicion, it's more about his insecurity. However, it's also his right to seek reassurance if he's genuinely worried. The problem is that the request is causing conflict. The author is justified in feeling hurt because it implies she's untrustworthy without any evidence. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be coming from a place of fear, perhaps due to past experiences or societal pressures. But if he hasn't identified a specific reason, his request could be seen as baseless. Relationships require mutual trust, and if one partner is constantly doubting the other without cause, that can be damaging. The author could be in the right if the fianc\u00e9 is being unreasonable. However, if there's a history of infidelity or mistrust in the relationship, that context is important. Without such context, the fianc\u00e9's stance seems unfair. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's anger is a natural response to a perceived lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's request might stem from his own fears rather than actual evidence. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because expecting trust from her partner is reasonable, and the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test without any reason could be the issue here.\n"
