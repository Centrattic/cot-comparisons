He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son. The author is 4 months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test after the baby is born. The author feels it's a lack of trust, and the fianc\u00e9 argues that many men have been tricked into raising someone else's child despite trusting their partners.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are the request for a paternity test, the author's anger due to perceived lack of trust, and the fianc\u00e9's justification based on others' experiences. The author's brothers also chimed in, suggesting that the author is in a better position to know the baby's parentage, and that the request is about trust.\n\nNow, paternity tests are typically requested when there's a question about the biological father. The fianc\u00e9's desire for a test implies some doubt, even if he hasn't had a specific reason. The author feels wronged because they haven't cheated and there's no indication of it, so the test seems unnecessary. The brothers' comments reinforce the idea that the author's perspective is valid since she can confirm the baby's origin, but the fianc\u00e9 can't. But the author is expecting trust from him, which the brothers imply is a two-way street. \n\nBut wait, trust in a relationship is mutual, right? If the author is certain about the paternity and the fianc\u00e9 isn't, maybe there's an underlying issue. The fianc\u00e9 might be dealing with past experiences or insecurities. However, the author's argument is that there's no reason to suspect her. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that it's a common issue, so he's being cautious. \n\nFrom a logical standpoint, the fianc\u00e9's request isn't entirely unreasonable if he has deep-seated concerns, but it does require a lot of trust. The author is justified in feeling hurt if there's no concrete evidence of infidelity. The brothers' points make sense because the author can confirm the baby's origin (through her own certainty and medical records), but the fianc\u00e9 can't. So, the test is his way of ensuring paternity, but it might come off as distrustful without a valid reason.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's the case. The author is not at fault for expecting trust, especially if there's no reason for suspicion. The fianc\u00e9's request could stem from personal insecurities or fear of being deceived, which is a different issue. While the test itself is a factual confirmation, the emotional aspect is about trust. The author's anger is a natural reaction to feeling untrusted without cause. \n\nHowever, maybe the fianc\u00e9's concern is valid in some contexts. But in this case, since the author hasn't done anything to warrant suspicion, expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9 might need to address his own insecurities rather than making a demand that challenges the author's trustworthiness. So, the author isn't the asshole here. They're in a position where trust is important, and the fianc\u00e9's request is causing unnecessary tension. \n\nBut wait, could there be a medical reason? The post doesn't mention any, so it's more about relationship trust. The author's reaction is about the emotional impact, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's brothers are right in pointing out the asymmetry in trust. The author can confirm her side, but the fianc\u00e9 can't, so his request for a test is his way to be sure, but it's not the other person's responsibility to accommodate that unless there's a valid reason. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because expecting trust without cause is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request is problematic because it's based on unfounded suspicion and not on evidence. The author's anger is a justified response to feeling untrusted without reason. The brothers' advice highlights the mutual trust aspect, but the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping here.\n"
