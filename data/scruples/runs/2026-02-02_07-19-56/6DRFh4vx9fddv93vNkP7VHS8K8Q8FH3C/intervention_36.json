He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child, which made the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men have been tricked into raising someone else's child, even when they trusted their partners. The author's brothers support the idea that the fianc\u00e9 should trust since the author knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. The author expects their fianc\u00e9 to trust them, which is reasonable. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about potential infidelity, which he justifies by referencing others' experiences. The question is whether the author is wrong to expect trust, or if the fianc\u00e9 is justified in his request for the paternity test.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, if there's no evidence of infidelity, the request for a paternity test could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might feel that the request is unfounded and disrespectful. However, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that his fears are based on real-life scenarios where people have been deceived. It's a balance between trust and the right to verify one's paternity, which is a legitimate concern for some people.\n\nThe author's brothers' comments suggest that they believe the author has a right to expect trust, as they can confirm the child's parentage (as the mother), which the father can't. This is a key point. The mother's certainty versus the father's uncertainty is a biological fact. The father's request might be based on his own insecurities or past experiences, but the author's perspective is valid in that they are being asked to accept a lack of trust without cause.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the author has done nothing to warrant suspicion, then expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request might be a red flag about his ability to trust the author, which is important for a healthy relationship. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's justification might be common, but it doesn't make it right if there's no basis for the suspicion.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have a valid expectation of trust, and the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test without any evidence could be seen as unreasonable. The author's reaction is justified given the circumstances.\n"
