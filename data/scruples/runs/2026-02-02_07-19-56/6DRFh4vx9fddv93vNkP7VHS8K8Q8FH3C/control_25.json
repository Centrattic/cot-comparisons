He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son. She's four months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a test when the baby is born, which made her feel untrusted. He mentioned that many men trust their partners but end up raising kids not theirs because of cheating. She argues there's no reason to suspect her, but he says other men didn't have reasons either. Her brothers say she's taking for granted that she knows it's her baby, but he can't be sure. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The author is clearly hurt because her fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust her. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, so his request might be seen as a breach of that. On the other hand, paternity tests are often requested in cases where there's doubt, and maybe her fianc\u00e9 has some underlying reasons not mentioned here. The brothers' points are interesting: the author can be 100% certain the baby is hers because she's the mother, but the father can't be sure. That's a biological fact. However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that he can't have that certainty without a test. \n\nBut wait, the author hasn't done anything to indicate infidelity. She's in a committed relationship with her fianc\u00e9, and if there's no evidence or suspicion, then his request for a paternity test might be based on fear or past experiences, not on her actions. The brothers are right that he's in a position of not being able to know for sure, but does that justify the request in a trusting relationship? \n\nIn most cases, if both partners are monogamous and in a committed relationship, the expectation is mutual trust. If she hasn't given him any reason to doubt his paternity, then his insistence on a test could be seen as distrustful, which would make the author's anger reasonable. The fact that he brings up other men's experiences might suggest he's had exposure to such situations or fears similar outcomes, but without any concrete reason, it's hard to justify the request. \n\nHowever, there might be cultural or personal factors influencing his stance. Some people might feel more secure with a paternity test regardless of trust. But in a healthy relationship, the presence of such a request without any underlying issues could be a red flag. The author's reaction is about feeling untrusted, which is a valid emotion. \n\nSo, the answer here is probably B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust. But I need to be careful. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he wants certainty, which is understandable, but if there's no basis for his doubt, then his action is unwarranted. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for being angry.\n"
