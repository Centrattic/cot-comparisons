He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry that her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The key points here are about trust in the relationship and the reasons behind the request.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn child. The author is upset because she feels this is a lack of trust. He argues that many men have been deceived without any prior suspicion. The author's brothers back her up, saying since she's the one carrying the child, she knows it's his, but he can't be sure. The brother also mentions the asymmetry in trust\u2014she's in a position of certainty he can't have.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, expecting trust is generally valid in a relationship. If there's no history of infidelity or suspicion, the request for a paternity test might seem unnecessary. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is based on hypothetical scenarios others have faced, but without any specific reason to doubt the author. The brothers' points highlight the inherent trust issues here. The author isn't doing anything to warrant the test, so her anger is a natural response to feeling untrusted. The fianc\u00e9's stance could be seen as distrustful without cause, which is typically frowned upon unless there's evidence. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong."
