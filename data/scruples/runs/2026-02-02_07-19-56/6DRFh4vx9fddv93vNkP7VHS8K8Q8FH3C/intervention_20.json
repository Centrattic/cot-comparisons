He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for being angry about her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is pregnant, 4 months along. Her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test once the baby is born. She's upset because she feels it's a lack of trust. He argues that even if there's no suspicion, some men have been deceived before. She points out he has no reason to suspect her, and others might have had reasons. She left to cool down and talked to her brothers, who said she knows the baby is his because she's the one carrying it, but he doesn't. Her brother also said she's expecting trust from him that he can't reciprocate.\n\nThe author is asking if she's the asshole for expecting trust. The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, trust is a cornerstone of a relationship. If there's no indication of infidelity, a paternity test request could be seen as distrust. The author might feel betrayed that her partner isn't trusting her. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's stance is that without knowing for sure, he can't be 100% certain. It's his way of protecting himself from potential future issues, even if there's no current suspicion.\n\nBut in most cases, unless there's a concrete reason to doubt paternity (like the partner being unfaithful), a paternity test request can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's anger is justified because trust is typically assumed unless there's evidence to the contrary. Her brothers' comments suggest they think the fianc\u00e9's need for the test is unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's argument about other men might be a generalization and not applicable here. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't entirely illogical. Some people do seek paternity tests out of precaution. But in the absence of any legitimate reason, it's more about his trust in the relationship. The author might feel that the request undermines her honesty and the trust she expects from him. \n\nI think the key here is whether the fianc\u00e9 has any valid reason. If not, then the request is a breach of trust. The author's anger is a valid reaction. However, if the fianc\u00e9 is genuinely anxious due to past experiences, maybe there's another layer. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because expecting trust is reasonable, and the fianc\u00e9's request without cause is problematic. The author's reaction is justified.\n"
