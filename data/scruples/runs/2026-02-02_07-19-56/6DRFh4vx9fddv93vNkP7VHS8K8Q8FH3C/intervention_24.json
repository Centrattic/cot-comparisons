He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is a woman who's four months pregnant and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. She's angry because she feels he doesn't trust her. He argues that even though he has no reason to suspect her of cheating, other men have been fooled like that. The author's brothers agree that she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body, but he doesn't. Her brother also says she's expecting a level of trust that she can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, first, the main issue is about trust. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test to ensure the baby is his. The author feels this is a lack of trust. But the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even if there's no suspicion, others have been deceived. The author's brothers support her view, emphasizing that she knows the baby is his, but he can't be certain unless tested. \n\nI should consider the perspectives. From the author's side, she's pregnant, so she has a biological certainty (assuming she's not cheating), while he doesn't. She's in a position where she could have another man's child, and he can't be sure unless tested. But in a trusting relationship, maybe the default is to assume fidelity unless there's a reason to doubt. However, the fianc\u00e9 is making a request based on precaution, not suspicion. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings of being untrusted are valid. Trust is a key component in a relationship. If he's asking for the test without any indication of infidelity, it might seem like he's not trusting her, which could be hurtful. But he's not accusing her of cheating; he's just taking a precaution. The question is whether that's reasonable.\n\nThe brothers' points are about the asymmetry of knowledge. She knows the baby is his, he doesn't. So from his perspective, he's asking for something that's not a given. But from her perspective, unless there's a reason to doubt, the expectation is trust. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might see the request as reasonable, especially if there's no suspicion but a fear of being deceived. Others might see it as a breach of trust. The author's anger is about the lack of trust, while the fianc\u00e9's request is about ensuring his biological certainty. \n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong to be angry. If the fianc\u00e9's request is based on precaution, not suspicion, maybe it's not unreasonable. However, the author's expectation of trust is also valid. If he's not accusing her of cheating, perhaps his request is more about his own peace of mind. But the author feels untrusted, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nIn many cases, trust is assumed unless there's a reason not to. So if there's no indication of infidelity, the request might be seen as lacking trust. On the other hand, paternity tests can be requested in cases of uncertainty, but here there's no uncertainty presented. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that others have been deceived, but that's a general statement. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's not cheating, then her anger is justified because he's not providing a reason for suspicion. The fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as unnecessary and distrustful. However, if he's genuinely concerned and not accusing her, maybe it's a reasonable precaution. But typically, in a healthy relationship, the default is trust unless there's evidence otherwise. Therefore, the author's reaction might be justified because the request could be perceived as a lack of trust without any evidence presented. The brothers' points about the asymmetry of knowledge also support the idea that the author has a valid point in expecting trust. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
