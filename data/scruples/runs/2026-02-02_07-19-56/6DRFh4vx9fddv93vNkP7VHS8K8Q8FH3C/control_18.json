He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he has no reason to suspect cheating, he's heard of cases where men trusted their partners and ended up with kids not theirs. The author's brothers say that since the baby is coming from the author's body, the fianc\u00e9 can't be 100% sure, and the author is expecting a level of trust they can't reciprocate.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about trust in the relationship and the validity of the fianc\u00e9's request. The author feels betrayed by the fianc\u00e9's request for a test, seeing it as distrust. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is using the \"what if other people are in this situation\" argument, which is a common justification for paternity tests. But the author's brothers point out that the fianc\u00e9's lack of trust is creating an imbalance in the relationship.\n\nPaternity tests usually come up when there's actual suspicion, like infidelity or medical concerns. Here, the fianc\u00e9 says there's no reason to suspect cheating. So maybe the issue is that the request is based on hypothetical fears rather than real evidence. That could be a problem because it's imposing a test that isn't medically necessary and might be based on paranoia.\n\nTrust is a fundamental part of any relationship. If one partner is constantly seeking proof of something that isn't in question, that can be damaging. The author's feeling of being untrusted is valid because the request for a paternity test without any reason to suspect infidelity is a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9's argument that others are in the same boat doesn't negate the current relationship's dynamics. It's about how they treat each other, not how others do it.\n\nThe brothers' comparison about not being able to reciprocate that level of trust might be a bit off. The author can't know the baby's paternity without a test, but the fianc\u00e9 should be able to trust that the author is faithful. The request for a test without evidence of cheating is the issue here. So the author isn't wrong for being upset. The fianc\u00e9 is acting on unfounded suspicions, which is the problem. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole in this situation. The answer should be B.\n"
