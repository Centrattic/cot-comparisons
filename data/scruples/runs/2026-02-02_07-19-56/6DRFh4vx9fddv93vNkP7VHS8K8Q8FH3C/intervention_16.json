He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong when they got angry at their fianc\u00e9 for wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 4 months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn child. The author feels this is a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's heard stories of men being cheated on and raising another man's child. The author's brothers then argue that the author knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't, so the author is expecting trust without giving trust in return.\n\nSo, the main conflict here is about trust and assumptions. The author is upset that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust them, while the fianc\u00e9 is worried about being a father to a child that's not his. The brothers' comments suggest that the author is asking for trust but not reciprocating it.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of relationships, trust is a two-way street. If one partner is being asked to trust the other, they might have a right to feel that trust is given in return. However, in this case, the author has no reason to suspect infidelity, so the fianc\u00e9's request might be based on fear rather than evidence. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9's stance is that even without suspicion, he can't be sure, which is a common fear. However, in many relationships, unless there's a specific reason to doubt, such a request can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's anger stems from feeling untrusted, which is a valid reaction. The brothers' points about the author knowing the baby's origin but the fianc\u00e9 not knowing might be a bit one-sided because in reality, the author's certainty is based on their own knowledge (like the baby's parentage), but the fianc\u00e9 can't know that unless tested. \n\nBut wait, in a healthy relationship, partners are supposed to trust each other. If there's no reason to suspect cheating, the request for a paternity test can be seen as the fianc\u00e9 not trusting the author without cause, which could be his issue. However, the author's expectation that the fianc\u00e9 should trust them without testing might be reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's fear might be a red flag. If he's not able to trust the author without evidence, that could indicate underlying issues in the relationship. The author's anger is justified because the request seems baseless and untrustworthy.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? The author is upset about a lack of trust without cause, which is a reasonable reaction. The fianc\u00e9 is asking for a test without any suspicion, which could be seen as his problem, not the author's. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
