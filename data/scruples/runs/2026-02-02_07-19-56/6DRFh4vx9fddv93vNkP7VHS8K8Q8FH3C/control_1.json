He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a pregnant fianc\u00e9 who's upset because her partner wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The author is angry at the request, feeling it's a lack of trust, while the fianc\u00e9 argues that it's about protecting himself from a possible situation where the child isn't his.\n\nSo, the main question is about trust and whether the author is being unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he has no reason to suspect her of cheating, others in similar situations have found out they weren't the biological fathers. The author's brothers support her view, saying she knows the baby is hers because she's carrying it, while he can't be sure unless tested. The older brother's comment about trust being one-sided is interesting.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and what's considered reasonable. Trust in a relationship is usually mutual, and the fianc\u00e9's request might come off as distrustful since there's no evidence of infidelity. However, some people might argue that wanting certainty is reasonable, especially if there's anxiety or past experiences. But generally, unless there's a specific reason to doubt, a paternity test request could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's anger seems justified because trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's stance might be protecting himself, but it could also undermine the relationship's trust foundation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the fianc\u00e9 hasn't provided a valid reason for his distrust. The answer might be B, the author is not the asshole.\n"
