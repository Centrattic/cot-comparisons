He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being angry that his fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is pregnant, and he's 4 months along. The fianc\u00e9 (the man) wants a paternity test for the baby once it's born. The woman is upset because she feels this is a lack of trust. The man's reasoning is that many men have trusted their partners and ended up raising children that weren't theirs. The woman's brothers support her, saying that since he can't know unless he tests, he's not being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the woman) is the asshole for expecting trust, or if the man is wrong to want the test. The answer options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider trust in relationships. It's important in a committed relationship. If both partners are in a monogamous relationship, the expectation of trust is mutual. The man wanting a paternity test could stem from fear or past experiences. But the woman is upset because she sees it as a lack of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the man's argument is that even if there's no suspicion, the possibility exists in general. He's using examples of other men who didn't suspect and were wrong. However, the woman feels that if there's no reason to suspect her, then the demand for a test is unnecessary. \n\nHer brothers' perspective is that the man can't know unless he tests, so he's within his rights to want it. But the woman's point is about mutual trust. If she's certain (since it's her body), but he isn't, maybe the issue is about differing levels of certainty. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a two-way street. If the woman hasn't done anything to warrant suspicion, the man's request might be seen as distrustful. However, the man could argue that it's about self-protection. The key here is whether the request is reasonable without any indication of infidelity. \n\nSocietal norms often place the burden on the woman when it comes to paternity tests, but that's a different issue. Legally, in some places, the man has the right to request a test. Ethically, though, if there's no evidence, it's more about his trust. \n\nThe woman might feel the request is a breach of trust, while the man sees it as a precaution. Both have valid points, but if there's no reason for suspicion, the man's request might be unreasonable. The woman is in the right to expect trust, especially if she's committed and there's no evidence of cheating. The man's demand could be causing unnecessary tension and may not be based on the woman's actions. \n\nSo, the answer is B (Not the asshole) because the woman is justified in feeling that her fianc\u00e9 is not trusting her without cause. The man's request for a paternity test without any suspicion is not reasonable, and the woman's expectation of trust is valid in a committed relationship.\n"
