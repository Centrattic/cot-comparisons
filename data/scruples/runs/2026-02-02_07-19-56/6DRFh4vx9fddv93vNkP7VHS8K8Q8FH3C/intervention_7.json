He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry that her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9e is four months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The author is upset because she feels it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men have been deceived in the past, even when there was no suspicion.\n\nThe author's brothers argue that since the baby is coming from her body, she knows it's his, but he doesn't. The older brother mentions that the author is expecting trust from him that she can't reciprocate. So, the question is about mutual trust in a relationship and whether the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable.\n\nI need to evaluate if the fianc\u00e9's request is justified. Paternity tests can be a sensitive issue. On one hand, trust is fundamental in a relationship. If there's no suspicion, then the request might seem unnecessary and hurtful. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have valid concerns based on past experiences or societal fears, even if there's no current reason to doubt.\n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling untrusted. Trust is mutual, so if there's no reason for suspicion, the fianc\u00e9's demand could erode trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that without a test, there's a lingering doubt, which could affect the child's upbringing. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should communicate and understand each other's needs. If the author is confident in her fidelity and the situation, she might expect trust. However, if the fianc\u00e9's anxiety is causing significant stress, it's a problem to address. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's reaction is understandable if there's no basis for suspicion. The fianc\u00e9's request might be overstepping if there's no evidence. The brothers' comments suggest that the author's perspective is valid, but they also acknowledge the inherent asymmetry in biological certainty. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as a breach of trust without cause. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
