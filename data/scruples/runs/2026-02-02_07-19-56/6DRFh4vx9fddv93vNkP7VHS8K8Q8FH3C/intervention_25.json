He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for being angry about the fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation involves a pregnancy and the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test, which the author feels is a lack of trust.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that she's upset because her fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust her, even though there's no reason to suspect cheating. She feels he's making a baseless accusation. Her brothers support her, saying that she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body, and she's demanding trust from him that he can't reciprocate. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's heard of men who trusted their partners and later found out the child wasn't theirs, so he wants a test as a precaution.\n\nNow, considering trust in relationships. Trust is fundamental. If there's no evidence of infidelity, asking for a paternity test can be seen as distrustful. However, the fianc\u00e9's concern might stem from past experiences or societal stories he's heard. But in this case, the author hasn't done anything to make him suspect her, so his request seems unwarranted. \n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling untrusted. She's justified in being upset if there's no basis for his suspicion. The fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting, using hypothetical scenarios to justify his lack of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel insecure, but that's not an excuse to request a test without reason.\n\nThe brothers' comments add another layer. They argue that she knows the baby is his, but he can't be sure unless tested. However, in most relationships, there's an assumption of fidelity unless there's evidence otherwise. The fianc\u00e9's demand challenges that assumption, which could be seen as unreasonable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she hasn't done anything to betray his trust, then no. Her anger is a valid response to his lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's request might be based on fear or insecurity, but that doesn't make it right. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is the one who initiated the distrust without cause.\n"
