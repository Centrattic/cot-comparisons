He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong regarding a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is upset because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even though they have no reason to suspect infidelity, many men have been tricked before, so he wants the test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The author feels their trust is being questioned, which is valid. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on fear of being deceived in the future, but does that justify the request? On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's stance is that he's protecting himself from a potential future issue. However, the author isn't cheating, and there's no evidence of it. The fianc\u00e9 is making a preemptive move that could cause harm to the relationship.\n\nThe brothers' opinions add another layer. They suggest that the author's perspective is different because they (as the woman) inherently know the baby is theirs, while the man can't be sure. But this line of thinking is a bit reductive. It implies that trust is one-sided. The author is asking for reciprocal trust, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request might be based on a fear of being wronged, but demanding a paternity test without any suspicion could be seen as undermining the trust the author expects.\n\nAlso, considering societal norms, paternity tests are often used when there's concrete suspicion. In this case, there's no indication of infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is more about hypothetical scenarios rather than real concerns. That could make the request seem unreasonable, especially if it's causing distress in the relationship.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's feelings of betrayal are valid because trust is mutual; the fianc\u00e9's request lacks a legitimate reason and is based on fear rather than evidence; and expecting trust is reasonable in a committed relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on the test might be the issue here.\n"
