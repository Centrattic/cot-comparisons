He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The fianc\u00e9 wants the test because he's heard stories of men being duped, even when they trusted their partners. The author feels he doesn't trust her, but her brothers argue that she inherently knows the baby is his, while he doesn't have that certainty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The author is upset because she feels her fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust her. But trust is mutual and often requires both parties to have confidence in each other. The fianc\u00e9, however, is worried about a scenario where he's unknowingly raising someone else's child. From his perspective, a paternity test could be a way to confirm paternity, even if there's no concrete reason to doubt. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that his request is a breach of trust. In many relationships, mutual trust is foundational. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as a lack of trust in the relationship. But then again, the brothers' reasoning is that he doesn't have the same certainty as the author, so his concern isn't entirely unfounded. \n\nThe key question here is whether the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable given the absence of any evidence against the author. If the author hasn't done anything to make him doubt her, then his request might be seen as an overreaction. However, some people might prioritize their own peace of mind, especially regarding the paternity of their child. \n\nBut the author's reaction is also valid because she feels disrespected. Trust is a two-way street. If the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a test without any suspicion, it could be seen as not trusting her. The brothers' point about the inherent certainty the author has versus the fianc\u00e9's lack of it is interesting, but does that justify the request? It depends on the relationship's dynamics and how they handle such issues. \n\nIn some cultures or personal beliefs, the idea of a paternity test is a big deal and might be seen as a failure of trust. Others might view it as a practical step to avoid future problems. The author's anger is understandable if she feels unreasonably doubted. However, the fianc\u00e9's fear is also a real concern for some people. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's expecting him to trust her without any doubts, but he's just being cautious, maybe not. However, she could also be expected to understand his need for reassurance, even if she feels it's unnecessary. The balance here is tricky. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the fianc\u00e9's request is based on his own anxieties rather than the author's actions. If there's no reason to suspect her, then his request could be seen as a personal insecurity rather than a justified distrust. In that case, the author's anger is valid. But if the fianc\u00e9 is just being cautious and the author is being overly sensitive, the answer could go the other way. \n\nGiven the context, the author is not in the wrong because she's reacting to a perceived lack of trust without any basis. However, the fianc\u00e9 might have his own reasons for needing reassurance. But since there's no evidence of infidelity, the request is unreasonable, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
