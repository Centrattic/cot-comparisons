He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test, which the author feels is a lack of trust. She's pregnant, and they argue about it. Her brothers' opinions are that the baby is hers because it's coming from her body, but the fianc\u00e9 can't know for sure. The author's brother also mentions she's asking for a level of trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, the main issue is trust and the request for a paternity test. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even if there's no suspicion, other men have been cheated on. The author feels wronged because she believes she hasn't done anything to warrant the test. \n\nI should consider the societal norms and relationships perspective. In many relationships, trust is fundamental. If there's no indication of infidelity, a paternity test request can seem distrustful. However, some people might argue that wanting certainty is reasonable, especially if the man has had past experiences or fears being deceived. \n\nBut the author's argument is that she hasn't given any reason for him to distrust her. Her brothers back her up, emphasizing that the physical aspect (pregnancy) doesn't require a test. The fianc\u00e9's stance might stem from insecurity or fear rather than actual suspicion. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the author hasn't done anything to break trust, her anger is justified. The fianc\u00e9 initiating a paternity test without cause is a breach of trust. However, some might say wanting certainty isn't entirely his fault if he's anxious. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's the one upset by the lack of trust, and there's no evidence of her wrongdoing, it's likely she's not in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The fianc\u00e9's request seems to be based on unfounded suspicion, and the author's expectation of trust is reasonable.\n"
