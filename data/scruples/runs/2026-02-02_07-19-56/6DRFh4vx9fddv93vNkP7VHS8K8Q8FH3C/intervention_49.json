He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the context: The author is 4 months pregnant and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test when the baby is born. The author feels disrespected and untrusted. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men have been deceived despite trusting their partners. The author's brothers say that the baby is obviously theirs since it's coming from the author, but the fianc\u00e9 can't know for sure. The older brother mentions the author is asking for trust that the fianc\u00e9 can't give back.\n\nSo, the main issue is about trust in the relationship. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 isn't trusting them, while the fianc\u00e9 is requesting the test to ensure the child is his. The brothers' arguments are interesting\u2014on one hand, the author's certainty versus the fianc\u00e9's uncertainty. But does that justify the fianc\u00e9's request?\n\nI need to consider if the author has a valid reason to be angry. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. If there's no suspicion of infidelity, then the request for a paternity test could be seen as a breach of trust. The author might feel that the fianc\u00e9 is accusing them without cause, which could hurt the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is about protecting himself from a situation where he might raise a child that isn't his. Some people might argue that it's his right to seek confirmation, especially if there's no medical reason to suspect otherwise but he's just feeling anxious. However, the absence of any specific reason to doubt the author's fidelity is important here. If there are no red flags, then the request seems unfounded and could be seen as a lack of trust. \n\nThe brothers' points also add to this. The author inherently knows the baby is theirs because they carried it, but the fianc\u00e9 can't have that certainty. The older brother's comment about expecting trust that isn't reciprocated is a key point. Relationships require mutual trust, and if one partner is requesting something that undermines that trust without justification, it's a problem.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9 has no reason to suspect infidelity, then his request for a paternity test could be seen as unreasonable. The author has a right to expect trust from their partner. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be driven by fear or insecurity, but that doesn't necessarily make it fair to the author. The author's anger is a reasonable reaction to being doubted without cause. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's request is based on unfounded suspicion, and the author is justified in feeling that their trust is being violated.\n"
