He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for being angry about wanting a paternity test. The fianc\u00e9 wants the test even though there's no suspicion of cheating. The author feels the request shows a lack of trust, while the fianc\u00e9 cites others who didn't suspect and ended up with kids not theirs.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel hurt and untrusted, which is valid. Trust in a relationship is crucial. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't unfounded; even if there's no suspicion, some people do raise children who aren't biologically theirs. But the author points out that there's no reason to suspect her, so why the test?\n\nThe brothers' comments add another angle. They say the author knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body, but he doesn't. The brother also mentions the trust balance. So maybe the fianc\u00e9 is seeking reassurance, but the author is feeling betrayed by the request.\n\nBut wait, in a healthy relationship, trust is a two-way street. If the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a paternity test without any reason, that does imply a lack of trust. But if he's genuinely worried, maybe there's something else? However, the scenario says there's no suspicion. So the request seems baseless. The author's anger is a reaction to perceived betrayal of trust. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable here, so the author's anger is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9 is acting unreasonably and the author has a right to expect trust.\n"
