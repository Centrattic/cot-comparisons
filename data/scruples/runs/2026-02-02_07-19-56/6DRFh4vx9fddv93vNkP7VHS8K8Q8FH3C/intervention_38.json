He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for being angry about her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a test for the unborn child, and the author feels it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that many men have been tricked into raising children not theirs. The author's brothers side with the fianc\u00e9, saying that since the baby is coming from her body, he can't be sure, but she can.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The author is upset because her partner is questioning her fidelity without any evidence. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and without cause, demanding something like a paternity test can be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't entirely unfounded in a general sense\u2014there are cases where men have been deceived. However, in this specific case, there's no indication that the author has been unfaithful.\n\nThe key points here are the absence of any evidence or suspicion against the author and the fianc\u00e9's decision to request a paternity test preemptively. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is based on hypothetical scenarios rather than any real concerns. The author's anger stems from feeling untrusted, which is a valid reaction when there's no basis for the suspicion.\n\nThe brothers' comments suggest they think the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable because he can't know the child is his. But in a healthy relationship, such a request without any grounds might be seen as overly cautious or distrustful. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable because there's no reason to doubt her in this context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's reacting to a situation where her partner is requesting a paternity test without any evidence against her. Her feeling that it's a lack of trust is valid. The fianc\u00e9's actions here could be seen as undermining the trust that should exist in their relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The answer would be B (No).\n"
