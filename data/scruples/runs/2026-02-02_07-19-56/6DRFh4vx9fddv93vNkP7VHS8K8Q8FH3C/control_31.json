He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even if he trusts her, others have ended up raising children not theirs. The author's brothers argue that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't know for sure unless tested, while the author feels they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part of any partnership. If one partner is questioning the other without any concrete reason, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9's concern is based on fear of being wronged by others' experiences, but in this case, there's no evidence of the author cheating. So the fianc\u00e9's request seems to stem from his own anxiety rather than the author's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be using the paternity test as a precaution. But the author feels hurt because it's an implication that she might be unfaithful. The brothers' comments add another layer: they're pointing out that the fianc\u00e9 can't be certain unless tested, but this might not address the emotional aspect of the author's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are whether the fianc\u00e9 has a legitimate reason to doubt and if his request is reasonable. Since there's no indication of infidelity, the fianc\u00e9's demand for a test could be seen as unnecessary and damaging to trust. The author isn't doing anything to warrant such a request, so her anger is justified because it's about the trust being broken without cause. The fianc\u00e9 is making a choice that affects the relationship's trust, which is a serious issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust; the fianc\u00e9's actions are the problem here.\n"
