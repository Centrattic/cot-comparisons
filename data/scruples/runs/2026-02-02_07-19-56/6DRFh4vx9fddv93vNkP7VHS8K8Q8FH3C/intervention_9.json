He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The author is pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a test once the baby is born. The author feels it's a lack of trust, while the fianc\u00e9 brings up examples of other men who were deceived.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is hurt because they feel their fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust them. Trust is a big part of a relationship, so being asked for a paternity test might feel like an accusation. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's protecting himself from a potential situation where he might raise a child that's not his. That's a valid concern, as some people do end up in that situation even without their partner cheating. \n\nThe author's brothers' comments are interesting. They say that the author knows the baby is theirs because it's coming from their body, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't have that same certainty. The older brother mentions a lack of mutual trust. So, maybe the issue is about differing levels of certainty and how that affects trust.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong... Well, the author's feelings are valid. Feeling untrusted can be really hurtful. However, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from a place of fear or past experiences. But is the request reasonable? Paternity tests are common in some situations, especially if there's doubt. But in this case, there's no indication of infidelity. The fianc\u00e9 is making the request without any specific reason to suspect the author. \n\nSo, if there's no evidence of cheating, then the request might be seen as a breach of trust. The author isn't doing anything to warrant suspicion, so the fianc\u00e9's demand could be unreasonable. The author's anger is a reaction to that perceived lack of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9 is also trying to protect himself, which is understandable. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the key point is whether the fianc\u00e9's request is justified. If there's no reason to suspect the author, then the request might be inconsiderate. The author isn't the one acting unfaithfully or suspiciously here. The fianc\u00e9's lack of trust could be the issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is not in the wrong because they haven't done anything to earn that suspicion. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on hypothetical scenarios rather than actual evidence. Therefore, the author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9 is asking for something that isn't justified by the circumstances.\n"
