He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The author feels this is an injustice and that the fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust her. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have trusted their partners and ended up with children not theirs. The author's brothers support her, saying she knows the baby is his because it's hers, but he can't know unless tested.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, the author might believe that if the relationship is healthy, trust should be inherent. Cheating allegations can be really damaging. However, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from past experiences or a lack of trust, even if there's no evidence. Is it reasonable to ask for a paternity test without any suspicion? That's debatable. \n\nOn one hand, the author hasn't done anything to warrant suspicion, so the request could be seen as baseless and hurtful. On the other, some people might argue that it's a safeguard, especially if there are underlying insecurities. But in the absence of any indication of infidelity, the fianc\u00e9's stance could be seen as distrustful, which the author is justified in being upset about.\n\nThe brothers' comments suggest that the author's perspective is valid. They point out that the fianc\u00e9 can't know the baby's father without a test, but the author can't know the baby's mother without a test either, but that's not an issue. This implies a double standard. The fianc\u00e9's demand for a test might be rooted in his own insecurity rather than any concrete reason. \n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner is willing to ask for a test without cause, it might indicate trust issues. The author's anger is a natural response to feeling untrusted. While the fianc\u00e9 has a right to his feelings, the way he's expressing them without evidence might be the problem. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable without any basis. The author is justified in expecting trust. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
