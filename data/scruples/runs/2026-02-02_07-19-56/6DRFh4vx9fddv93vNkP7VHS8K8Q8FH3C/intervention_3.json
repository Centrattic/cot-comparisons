He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being angry about their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, the context is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn child. The author feels this is a trust issue because they don't have any reason to suspect the fianc\u00e9's infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men have been duped into raising kids that aren't theirs, so maybe he's just cautious. The author's brothers argue that the fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because he can't be sure unless tested, while the author believes trust should be inherent.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a two-way street, but sometimes people have different thresholds for what they consider trust. The author might feel disrespected or doubted, which is valid. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's request could stem from a fear of being deceived in the future. However, the author points out that there's no reason to suspect infidelity, which might make the request seem unnecessary and distrustful.\n\nThe key here is whether expecting trust without evidence of betrayal is reasonable. The author's anger is about feeling untrusted without cause. The fianc\u00e9's request, while possibly well-intentioned, might be seen as a breach of trust. The brothers' comments highlight that the fianc\u00e9's position is a different kind of trust\u2014since he can't know unless tested. But in a healthy relationship, trust is supposed to be foundational without needing proof.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9 is making a request based on hypothetical scenarios without any real reason, that could be seen as not trusting the author unnecessarily. The author's reaction is about feeling untrusted, which is a reasonable expectation in a committed relationship. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because expecting trust is reasonable, especially when there's no evidence of wrongdoing. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on a test without cause might be the real issue here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
