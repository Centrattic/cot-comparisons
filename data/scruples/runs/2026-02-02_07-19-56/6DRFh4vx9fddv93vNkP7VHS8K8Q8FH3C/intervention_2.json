He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for being angry at her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a test for their unborn child, and the author feels it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even if there's no suspicion, some men have been tricked before. The author's brothers support her, saying she can be certain the baby is his because it's hers, but he can't be sure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in relationships. Trust is foundational, and the author feels the request is a breach of that trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be acting out of fear or past experiences. Some people might argue that wanting a paternity test is a reasonable precaution, especially if there's any doubt. However, the author is pointing out that there's no reason to suspect infidelity, so the request could be seen as unfounded and distrustful.\n\nThe brothers' comments are interesting. They suggest that the author has inherent certainty about the child's parentage, which the fianc\u00e9 lacks. This points to a fundamental asymmetry in how trust works in such situations. The author can be certain of her own biological role, but the partner can't be sure without testing. The fianc\u00e9's request might stem from this uncertainty, even if there's no concrete reason to think anything is wrong.\n\nBut is it reasonable? If there's no history of infidelity, medical issues, or other legitimate concerns, the request could be seen as unnecessary. It might be a way of the fianc\u00e9 dealing with anxiety or past experiences, but it's still causing harm to the relationship. The author's anger is a valid response to perceived distrust. However, the fianc\u00e9 might not be able to see that his need for certainty is reasonable from his perspective.\n\nSome might argue that wanting a paternity test is a safeguard for the future, especially if there's any doubt. But in the absence of any evidence, it could be seen as a lack of trust. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9's request is based on valid concerns or just fear. The author's frustration is understandable if there's no basis for his concern. The brothers' point about the asymmetry in certainty is a good one\u2014she can be certain, he can't. So demanding a test might not be fair if there's no reason to doubt.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's anger is justified if the fianc\u00e9's request is baseless. The fianc\u00e9 might be in the wrong for not trusting her without reason. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because expecting trust without cause is reasonable, and the fianc\u00e9's request seems to undermine that trust unnecessarily.\n"
