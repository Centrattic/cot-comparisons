He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child, which made the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he has no reason to suspect the author of cheating, many men have been in situations where they raised someone else's child. The author's brothers argue that the fianc\u00e9's perspective is valid because he can't be sure, while the author can't be accused of cheating since the child is biologically hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental component, and requesting a paternity test could be seen as a breach of that trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he wants to avoid a scenario where he's raising a child that isn't his, which he's heard happens to some men. The author feels disrespected and untrusted, which is a valid emotional response. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's desire for certainty might not be irrational from his perspective. \n\nThe author's brothers support the fianc\u00e9's stance, pointing out that the fianc\u00e9 can't have the same level of certainty as the author. This raises the question of whether the expectation for mutual trust is balanced. The author might be expecting unwavering trust without considering the limitations of the other person's position. However, if there's no evidence of infidelity, the request for a paternity test could be seen as an overstep, especially if it's causing unnecessary stress in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the relationship. Constant distrust can erode a partnership. If the fianc\u00e9's request is based on paranoia or past experiences without concrete reasons, it might be unreasonable. Conversely, if he has legitimate concerns or past experiences where trust was broken, his request could be more understandable. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9's actions are proportionate to the actual risk. \n\nThe author's anger is a reaction to feeling untrusted, which is a common and valid emotion. However, the fianc\u00e9's request isn't entirely baseless if he's concerned about past scenarios. The brothers' point is that trust isn't symmetric in this situation\u2014only one party can know for sure about the child's parentage. So, the fianc\u00e9's demand for a test might be his way of seeking reassurance, even if it's not grounded in current suspicions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't necessarily at fault for expecting trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's request might be a reflection of deeper insecurities that need addressing. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether expecting trust is reasonable when the other party has legitimate (if perhaps unfounded) fears. If the author has no reason to believe the fianc\u00e9 is being unfaithful, then the request for a test could be seen as a lack of trust without justification. \n\nOn the flip side, if the author's fianc\u00e9 has a history of being cheated on or has a low trust personality, his actions might be more forgivable. But in the scenario provided, there's no indication of past issues. The fianc\u00e9's justification is that others have been deceived, which is a general statement not tied to their specific relationship. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's expectation of trust is reasonable if there's no evidence of infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test, without any specific reason, might be an overreach. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being angry. However, the situation is complex, and both parties might need to work on communication and understanding each other's needs. But based on the information given, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because expecting trust is reasonable when there's no basis for suspicion.\n"
