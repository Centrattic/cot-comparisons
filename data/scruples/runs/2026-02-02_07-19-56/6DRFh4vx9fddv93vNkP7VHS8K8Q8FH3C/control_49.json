He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is upset because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though there's no reason to suspect cheating, others have been in similar situations and ended up raising someone else's child. The author's brothers argue that the author knows the baby is theirs because it's coming from their body, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't have that certainty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that expecting a paternity test is a breach of trust. Trust is a big part of any relationship, especially in marriage or engagement. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, then the request for a paternity test might seem like an overreaction. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is worried about the possibility of not being the biological father, which is a real concern for some people. The brothers' point is that the author can't fully understand the fianc\u00e9's uncertainty because they don't have to question the baby's parentage.\n\nI should think about whether the request is reasonable. If there's no evidence of cheating, then maybe the request is based on fear rather than facts. However, some people might take precautions even without suspicion. But in a committed relationship, trust is usually assumed. The author's anger might be justified if the request is seen as distrustful. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning about other men's experiences could be a way to justify his own fears, but that doesn't necessarily make it right to impose that on the partner.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author's brothers support the fianc\u00e9's perspective might indicate that some people think the author is asking for too much trust. But the author is in a position where they can be certain about the baby's origin, while the fianc\u00e9 can't. So maybe the fianc\u00e9's need for certainty is valid, but the way he's expressing it is causing conflict.\n\nBut then again, in healthy relationships, partners trust each other without needing constant proof. The request for a paternity test could be a sign of underlying issues in the relationship, like insecurity or past experiences. The author might feel that the fianc\u00e9 isn't trusting them, which is a legitimate feeling. So, is the author wrong for expecting trust? If there's no reason to doubt, then the author's expectation is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request might be unreasonable because it's based on hypothetical scenarios rather than reality.\n\nI think the key here is whether there's a valid reason for the paternity test. If not, then the request is a breach of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning about other men's situations doesn't apply if there's no context for suspicion. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer would be B (No).\n"
