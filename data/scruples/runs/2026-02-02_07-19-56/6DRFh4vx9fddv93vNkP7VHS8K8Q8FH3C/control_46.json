He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to understand it better.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who is 4 months pregnant. Her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. She's angry because she feels like he doesn't trust her. He argues that even though he has no reason to suspect her of cheating, many men have trusted their partners and ended up raising children who weren't theirs. They argued, and she went to her parents' house to cool off. She talked to her brothers, who said that she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body, but he doesn't. The older brother added that she's asking for trust he can't give back.\n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental part of any partnership. If the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a paternity test without any evidence of infidelity, that might indicate a lack of trust. On the other hand, the author is feeling untrusting because the request seems baseless to her.\n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that others in similar situations have been deceived. However, in this case, there's no indication that the author has cheated. So is it reasonable for him to demand a test just to be sure? Maybe not. Trust is supposed to be mutual. If he can't trust her without evidence, that's a problem. But then again, some people might feel the need for reassurance, especially if they've been hurt before or have a history of such concerns.\n\nThe author's brothers' perspective is interesting. They say she knows the baby is his because it's from her body, but he can't be sure. However, unless there's a medical reason to suspect otherwise (like maybe if she had a history of fertility treatments involving third parties), the biological father would typically be the fianc\u00e9. The request for a paternity test in this case might be more about his personal insecurity than any real suspicion.\n\nIn relationships, expecting mutual trust is reasonable. If the fianc\u00e9 can't extend that trust, even without evidence, it could be considered a breach of trust. The author feeling hurt is valid because trust is a two-way street. However, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from fear of being deceived in the future. But without any reason to suspect infidelity, the demand for a test could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nSo, the author's anger is about her fianc\u00e9 not trusting her. Her brothers support her, suggesting that the request is unfair. From an outsider's perspective, the fianc\u00e9's demand seems to lack a basis and could be an issue with his ability to trust, not hers. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting trust, while the fianc\u00e9's request might be the problem. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
