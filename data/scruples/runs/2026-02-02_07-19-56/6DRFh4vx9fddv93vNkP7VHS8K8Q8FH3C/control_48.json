He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is pregnant and their fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. The author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust, and the fianc\u00e9's response is that other men have been wronged by trusting their partners. The author's brothers are siding with the fianc\u00e9, saying that since the author knows the baby is theirs (because it's coming from their body), the fianc\u00e9 can't have that certainty. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for expecting trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Generally, trust is a cornerstone. If one partner is questioning the other's fidelity without any evidence, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The author hasn't done anything to suspect infidelity, so the fianc\u00e9's request seems baseless. But the fianc\u00e9 is using the argument that other men have been wronged, which is a common fear but doesn't justify suspicion without cause.\n\nThe brothers' points are interesting. They say the author has certainty, the fianc\u00e9 doesn't. That makes sense because the author knows the baby is theirs biologically. The fianc\u00e9, however, can't be sure unless tested. But in normal circumstances, unless there's a history of infidelity or other red flags, expecting a paternity test without evidence could be seen as unreasonable. The author is in a position where they can be sure of the baby's parentage, so the fianc\u00e9's request might be based on insecurity rather than actual reason. \n\nBut then again, some might argue that in a committed relationship, it's the woman who is certain, and the man can't be sure unless tested. So maybe the fianc\u00e9's request is a way to protect himself. But unless there's a valid reason, like the author has a history of cheating or there's some other issue, it's about his trust in the relationship. The author is hurt because the request feels like an accusation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The fianc\u00e9 is asking for a paternity test without any grounds, which can be seen as a lack of trust. The author's anger is a valid reaction because it's a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning about other men is a generalization. The author is expecting trust, which is reasonable in a healthy relationship. The brothers' advice makes sense here. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust from their partner. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
