He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, which made the author angry because they felt it was a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men who trusted their partners ended up raising other people's kids. The author's brothers support her, saying she knows the baby is theirs because it's coming from her body, but he doesn't, and that she's expecting trust she can't reciprocate.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are trust in a relationship and the request for a paternity test. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust her, especially since there's no indication she's been unfaithful. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is concerned about paternity, which is a common issue in relationships, though it's often sensitive.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is fundamental. The author's argument is that the fianc\u00e9 shouldn't question her fidelity without reason. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about protecting himself from a potential situation where he might not be the biological father. The brothers' comments add that the author can't reciprocate the same level of trust because she knows the baby is hers, but he can't know unless tested. That's a valid point, as biological certainty is different for the mother and father.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, expecting trust is reasonable in a committed relationship, especially when there's no evidence of infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test might stem from his own fears or past experiences, but it's still a breach of trust. The author's anger is a reaction to feeling untrusted, which is a common and understandable response. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning about not wanting to raise another man's child is also a real concern for some people. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, open communication and understanding each other's perspectives are crucial. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling hurt; trust is a two-way street. The fianc\u00e9's request, while based on his fears, might not be justified without any reason to suspect infidelity. The brothers' advice highlights the asymmetry in certainty, which is a valid point. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust. The fianc\u00e9's request is his issue to resolve, but the author's reaction is a normal response to a perceived lack of trust. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
