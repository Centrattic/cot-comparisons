He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for being angry about her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test.\n\nFirst, the context: She's pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. She's upset because it feels like he doesn't trust her. He argues that even if men trust their partners, they might still end up with a child that's not theirs. Her brothers say she knows the baby is his because it's hers, but he can't be certain. The main conflict is about trust and the expectation of it.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. From her perspective, she might feel that her fianc\u00e9's request is a breach of trust. Trust in a relationship is crucial, and if one partner is demanding a test without any indication of infidelity, it could be hurtful. She might believe that he should trust her without needing proof, especially since there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's just being cautious. He's heard stories where men trusted their partners but were later surprised. His concern isn't about her specifically, but a general precaution. However, the problem here is that there's no reason to suspect her. If there's no evidence or history of infidelity, his request might be seen as unnecessary and distrustful.\n\nHer brothers argue that she knows the baby is his, but he doesn't. This points out the asymmetry in certainty. She can't be 100% sure of the baby's paternity without a test, but he can't be certain either. However, the key here is the intent behind his request. If he's doing it out of fear or lack of trust, even without a reason, that's a problem.\n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner acts in a way that shows they don't trust the other without cause, that can be damaging. The fianc\u00e9's request might be well-intentioned as a precaution, but in practice, it's causing hurt because there's no evidence of wrongdoing. The author's anger is a valid reaction to feeling untrusted. It's reasonable for her to expect trust from her partner, especially in the absence of any suspicion.\n\nHowever, some might argue that wanting a paternity test is his right, and she shouldn't be angry. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. If he's doing it without any reason, it's more about his lack of trust than her wrongdoing. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable here. Her brothers' comments reinforce the idea that she's in the right because she has no reason to be untrustworthy, and his request is based on hypotheticals rather than reality.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Her anger stems from feeling disrespected and distrusted without cause. The fianc\u00e9's request is unjustified in this context, so the answer should be B (No).\n"
