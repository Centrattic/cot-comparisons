He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even if other men trusted their partners and were cheated on, he's just being cautious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The author is pregnant, and the baby is biologically hers, so she might feel that the paternity is obvious. However, the fianc\u00e9's request stems from fear or past experiences where others were deceived. The question is about whether the author is wrong for expecting trust. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, feeling hurt and angry is valid because the request implies distrust. In a committed relationship, especially with a fianc\u00e9, expecting mutual trust is reasonable. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have legitimate concerns, maybe due to personal history or societal examples where infidelity occurred without prior signs.\n\nThe brothers' opinions suggest that the author's perspective is valid\u2014they point out that the baby's biological mother is obvious, and the fianc\u00e9's lack of trust is a problem. The key here is whether the author's expectation of trust is unreasonable. If the author has no reason to suspect cheating and the fianc\u00e9's request is based on unfounded fears, then the author's reaction is justified. However, if the fianc\u00e9's request is due to some legitimate concerns, maybe there's a middle ground. \n\nBut the situation as presented doesn't indicate any specific reason for the fianc\u00e9's distrust. He mentions \"lots of men\" who were deceived, which could be general paranoia. The author is in a position where the baby is hers, so the request for a paternity test seems unnecessary unless there's a specific reason. The author's anger stems from feeling untrusted without cause. The fianc\u00e9's stance might be seen as not giving credit to the author's fidelity, so the author isn't wrong in feeling hurt. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable without specific reasons, and the author's expectation of trust is valid in a committed relationship.\n"
