He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry about her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The author feels this is a lack of trust, while the fianc\u00e9 is worried about the possibility of not being the biological father, referencing other men who were deceived. The author's brothers argue that since the baby comes from her, she knows it's his, but he doesn't. The author's brother also says she's expecting trust he can't reciprocate. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nHmm. The key points here are trust, the reasons behind wanting the paternity test, and communication. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on fear of being deceived, even without evidence. The author feels disrespected and mistrusted. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If there's no indication of infidelity, asking for a paternity test can seem like an overreaction and a breach of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's protecting himself from a scenario that others have faced without prior suspicion. But the absence of any evidence or suspicion on his part might mean his request is unfounded. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction is valid because trust is a two-way street. If one partner is asked to trust without evidence, especially in a situation where the other isn't reciprocating that trust, it can lead to feelings of betrayal. The brothers' point about the asymmetry in trust is valid\u2014she knows the baby is his because she's the carrier, but he can't know without a test. But that doesn't necessarily justify his request if there's no reason to doubt.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from insecurity or past experiences. Without more context, it's hard to say. But the fact that he's bringing up other men's experiences without any personal red flags might indicate that his own trust is not grounded in their specific relationship. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's being asked to trust without reason, she's not the one in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's demand for a paternity test without cause could be seen as undermining the relationship's foundation of trust. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The fianc\u00e9 might need to address his trust issues or seek counseling to understand the impact of his request on the relationship.\n"
