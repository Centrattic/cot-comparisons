He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test because he's worried about being cheated on. He mentions that even though he has no reason to suspect her, he's heard stories of men being deceived. The author is upset because she feels he's not trusting her, which is valid. Being asked to do a paternity test can feel like an accusation, even if it's not meant that way.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reasoning is about protecting himself, maybe to avoid raising a child that's not his. That's a real concern for some people. But is it reasonable? It depends on the context. If there's no suspicion, maybe it's overreacting. The author's brothers say that since she knows the baby is his, he should trust her. That makes sense because she's the one carrying the child and knows the circumstances. \n\nBut then again, trust in relationships is mutual. If the fianc\u00e9 can't trust her without proof, that's a problem. The author expects trust just as she gives it. If he can't meet that expectation, it might strain the relationship. However, if he's genuinely anxious or has past experiences that lead him to need the test, it's more complex. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't cheating, but the request for a test makes her feel untrusted. The fianc\u00e9 is acting out of fear, not proof. In healthy relationships, trust is essential. If he can't trust her without evidence, maybe he's not ready for fatherhood or there's deeper insecurity. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's justified in feeling hurt because trust is a two-way street. Her brothers' advice highlights that the test is unnecessary. The fianc\u00e9's request is his choice, but expecting the author to accept it without feeling wronged is unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
