He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe author is a woman four months pregnant with her fianc\u00e9's child. She got angry when her fianc\u00e9 wanted to request a paternity test for their unborn son. He brought this up as a serious talk, and he's worried about the possibility of not being the biological father, even though he has no reason to suspect her of cheating. The author feels that he doesn't trust her, and he responds by saying that other men without suspicion also get paternity tests to avoid raising someone else's child. They argue, and the author goes to her parents' house to cool down. Her brothers support her, saying that since the baby comes out of her, she knows it's his, but he can't be sure. Her older brother also mentions that she's expecting a level of trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, she's in the wrong) or B (No, she's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship. The author is upset because her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test without any evidence of infidelity. From her perspective, this could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is expressing a concern that many people have\u2014how to ensure that the child is biologically his, to prevent potentially raising someone else's child if infidelity occurred. \n\nHowever, there's no indication that the author has done anything to justify his suspicion. If there's no history of cheating or any reason for distrust, then the request for a paternity test might be seen as unnecessary and hurtful. The fianc\u00e9 is taking a defensive stance, which could be a protective measure, but it's also causing emotional harm. \n\nThe author's brothers' comments are interesting. They say that the fianc\u00e9 can't know the baby is his because he wasn't there, while the author knows it's his. This is a common argument in such situations. However, paternity tests are often requested in cases where there's a need for legal certainty, especially for inheritance, medical history, etc. But again, without any evidence of infidelity, the request might come off as a lack of faith in the partner.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9 has a right to be certain, but without any cause for suspicion, it's hard to see the fairness in that. The author's feelings of betrayal and lack of trust are valid. If the fianc\u00e9 can't trust her, that's a significant issue in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern is about a real possibility, albeit rare. If he's worried about the implications of not being the biological parent, maybe there are deeper issues in the relationship, like past experiences, trust issues, or fears of infidelity. But the author doesn't have a history of cheating, so his request is based on hypotheticals rather than facts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems that the fianc\u00e9 is overstepping by requesting a paternity test without any reason to suspect her. The author's anger is a valid reaction to feeling untrusted. The fianc\u00e9's stance is causing unnecessary pain and could be a sign of deeper trust issues. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
