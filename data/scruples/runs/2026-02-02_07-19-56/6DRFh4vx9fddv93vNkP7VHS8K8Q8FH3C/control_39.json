He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a fianc\u00e9e who's angry that her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he doesn't suspect her of cheating, he's heard stories where men trusted their partners and ended up raising kids that weren't theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author feels hurt and mistrusted because the fianc\u00e9 wants the test without any signs of cheating. The fianc\u00e9 is coming from a place of fear, maybe past experiences or stories he's heard. His brothers told him that he can't know for sure without a test, which makes sense because biologically, the mother is certain, but the father can't be unless tested.\n\nIs expecting trust reasonable? Well, in a relationship, trust is a big part. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the author might feel that the request undermines their trust in each other. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel he's being cautious, even if it's not about suspicion but fear of a bad situation.\n\nBut the problem is whether the request is justified. If there's no evidence of cheating, then the request could be seen as not trusting her without cause. However, the fianc\u00e9 isn't necessarily accusing her; he's just wanting to confirm, maybe to protect future feelings. But it's still a test that implies doubt. \n\nThe brothers' comments are interesting. They say that the author knows the baby is theirs because it's coming from her. That's true, but the fianc\u00e9 can't know that without the test. But if they're in a committed relationship and there's no cheating, the need for the test might stem from insecurity rather than a valid reason. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for being angry? Probably not. She's in a position where she's expected to trust him, and he's asking for something that feels like a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is flawed because he's using hypotheticals to justify a test without actual suspicion. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust. The fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
