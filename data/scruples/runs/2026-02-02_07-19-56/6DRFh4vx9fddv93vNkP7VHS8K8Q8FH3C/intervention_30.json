He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The fianc\u00e9 wants the test because of some unnamed reasons, but the author feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels that wanting a paternity test is a lack of trust. That makes sense because in a committed relationship, trust is usually a big factor. If there's no evidence of infidelity, asking for a test could come off as suspicious. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's argument is that even if others didn't have reasons, they still ended up in situations where they weren't the biological father. So he's using a general precaution.\n\nThe brothers' responses seem to side with the author. They say the author knows the baby is his, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't. The brother's point is about the asymmetry in trust\u2014since the author can be certain of the baby's parentage, but the fianc\u00e9 can't. That's a key point. The author expects trust from the fianc\u00e9, but the fianc\u00e9 is asking for something that the author can confirm but he can't. \n\nIs it reasonable for the fianc\u00e9 to want a paternity test? If there's no reason to suspect anything, then maybe not. But if the fianc\u00e9 has some doubt, even if it's not justified, he might feel the need. However, in a healthy relationship, trust is foundational. The author's anger seems justified because the request might be based on insecurity rather than evidence. \n\nThe author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as a breach of trust, especially without any indication of infidelity. The brothers' advice points out that the author is asking for something (trust) that the fianc\u00e9 can't fully reciprocate, which complicates things. But the core issue is whether the request is justified. \n\nIn many relationships, partners don't get paternity tests unless there's a specific reason. The fianc\u00e9's reason here is vague\u2014just that other men were surprised. That's not a strong enough justification. The author is right to feel hurt because it's about trust. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request might be the issue here, making the author not the asshole.\n"
