He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which upsets the author. The key points are trust, the reasonableness of the request, and the context of the relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is angry because the fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust them. They argue that there's no reason to suspect infidelity, and the fianc\u00e9's justification is that \"lots of men trusted their partners and found out later.\" The brothers support the author, saying that the fianc\u00e9 isn't in a position to know for sure, unlike the author who knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test implies a lack of trust. The author feels betrayed and hurt, which is a valid emotional response. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is based on fear of raising someone else's child, which is a real concern for some people. But the question is whether his request is reasonable. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, trust is generally expected without needing external validation unless there's a valid reason to doubt. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't provided any specific evidence or reason to suspect the author, so the request might stem from insecurity rather than any actual infidelity. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's demand for a paternity test without cause could be seen as a breach of trust, making the author's anger justified. The brothers' comments also highlight the asymmetry in certainty\u2014the author knows the baby is his, but he can't know without the test, which might not be a strong argument since the test is a precaution he's requesting. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also important. If he has a history of such concerns or has seen others go through similar situations, his fear might be genuine. But in the absence of any indication of infidelity, the request seems baseless. The author's anger is a reaction to a lack of trust without cause, which is a valid feeling. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable given the lack of evidence, and the author's expectation of trust is justified. Therefore, the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
