He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for being angry that his fianc\u00e9e wants a paternity test. Wait, actually, wait. Wait, the original question is from the fianc\u00e9e's perspective. Let me check again.\n\nThe scenario is that the fianc\u00e9e is four months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn son. The fianc\u00e9e is angry because she feels he doesn't trust her. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even though he has no reason to suspect her of cheating, many men have been tricked into raising children not theirs. The fianc\u00e9e went to her parents, talked to her brothers, who said that she knows the baby is hers because it's coming from her body, but he doesn't. Her brother also said she's expecting a level of trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong. But the original question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is the asshole for expecting trust, while the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. Wait, the author is the one whose fianc\u00e9 wants the paternity test. The author is angry about that. The user (the person asking the question) is the fianc\u00e9e, and they're asking if they're the asshole for being angry. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want to know the opinion.\n\nSo the main question is: is the author (the fianc\u00e9e) in the wrong for being upset that her partner wants a paternity test, given that there's no evidence of infidelity? The options are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics and trust. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test implies a lack of trust in the author. However, he justifies it by citing others' experiences where they ended up raising children not theirs. The author feels this is a breach of trust, which is understandable. But the fianc\u00e9 is acting out of fear or past experiences. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust should be mutual. If there's no evidence of infidelity, then the request for a paternity test might be seen as an overreaction or a lack of trust without cause. The author's anger is a valid reaction because it challenges her trustworthiness without justification. However, the fianc\u00e9's stance could be influenced by past experiences or anxiety, which might not be entirely his fault but still problematic in terms of relationship health. \n\nThe brothers' comments suggest that the author inherently knows the baby is hers, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't. This points to an asymmetry in trust. The author expects trust, which is reasonable, while the fianc\u00e9 is seeking certainty through a test. The conflict arises from differing expectations of trust and security.\n\nIn relationships, both parties should work towards mutual trust. If one partner is unable to trust without concrete evidence, that can cause strain. The request for a paternity test without any suspicion might be seen as unreasonable, as it's based on fear rather than evidence. Therefore, the author's anger is justified because trust is foundational, and the fianc\u00e9's request undermines that trust without reason. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's request is unjustified and the author's expectation of trust is reasonable.\n"
