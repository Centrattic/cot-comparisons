He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have trusted their partners only to find out later the child isn't theirs. The author's brothers argue that the fianc\u00e9 is justified because he can't be sure unless tested.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are trust in a relationship and the reasonableness of wanting a paternity test. The author feels their fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust them, but the fianc\u00e9 cites examples of other men being deceived. The author's brothers support the fianc\u00e9's stance, emphasizing the asymmetry of knowledge\u2014the woman knows for sure, but the man doesn't unless tested.\n\nIs the author wrong for expecting trust? In healthy relationships, trust is fundamental. If there's no indication of infidelity, the fianc\u00e9's request might be based on fear rather than evidence. However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that he's protecting himself from potential future issues. But the author's reaction is valid because such a request can feel like a breach of trust. \n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9's argument is that even without suspicion, others have been cheated. However, that's a generalization. The author is asserting that there's no reason to suspect them. If the relationship is based on mutual trust, then the request for a paternity test could be seen as undermining that trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have valid fears, but acting on hypotheticals without evidence could be problematic.\n\nThe brothers' point about the asymmetry of knowledge is interesting. The woman inherently knows the baby is hers, but the man can't be sure unless tested. However, that's a biological fact, not a reflection of the woman's behavior. So the man's need for certainty might stem from insecurity rather than the woman's actions.\n\nIn terms of expectations, the author is right to expect trust. If the fianc\u00e9 can't trust without a test, that might indicate deeper issues in the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling betrayed by the request. But the fianc\u00e9 isn't entirely wrong either because he's trying to protect himself. However, in a trusting relationship, the default should be trust unless there's a valid reason. Since there's no evidence of cheating, the request is unreasonable. So the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about the lack of trust.\n"
