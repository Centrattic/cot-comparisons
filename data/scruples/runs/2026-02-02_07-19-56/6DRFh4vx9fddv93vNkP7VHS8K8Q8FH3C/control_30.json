He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is they're four months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a test when the baby is born. The author feels he doesn't trust her, and her brothers are on her side, saying she's not at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments on both sides. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he doesn't want to raise someone else's child, even if he trusts her. He mentions other men who didn't suspect cheating but ended up in that situation. The author feels this is a breach of trust and that her brothers support her stance. \n\nTrust in a relationship is huge. If one partner wants a paternity test after the birth, that can be seen as a lack of trust. Especially if there's no reason to suspect infidelity, as the author points out. The fianc\u00e9's argument is about protecting himself from a hypothetical scenario, but this might come off as distrustful. \n\nThe author's brothers argue that she knows the baby is his because she's the one pregnant, but he can't know for sure. However, in a healthy relationship, trust is a mutual expectation. If there's no evidence of cheating, the request for a paternity test might be seen as unnecessary and damaging to the relationship's trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't entirely unreasonable. People do cheat, and if he has anxiety about this, maybe there are deeper issues in the relationship. But the fact that there's no suspicion of cheating here makes it more about his lack of trust rather than a justified precaution. \n\nThe author's anger is a natural response to feeling untrusted. The brothers' support might indicate that her feelings are valid. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning might be logical, but in human relationships, emotions and trust are crucial. So, the question is whether the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable without any basis. \n\nI think the key here is whether the request is based on valid reasons or just fear. Since there's no evidence of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's request seems to lack trust in the relationship. The author is justified in feeling hurt and angry because trust is a fundamental part of a partnership. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
