He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The fianc\u00e9e feels that the request for a paternity test is a breach of trust. She's pregnant, and she's upset because she believes he doesn't trust her. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is concerned because he's heard stories of men being deceived about their children's paternity. He's not accusing her of cheating but is just worried about the possibility.\n\nThe brothers' input is also mentioned. They argue that since she knows the baby is his (as it's coming from her body), he can't know for sure unless tested. The older brother's comment about trust being a two-way street is a key point here. The fianc\u00e9e is expecting trust without being able to reciprocate the same level of certainty.\n\nNow, the central issue is about mutual trust in the relationship. The author is upset because she feels she should be trusted, but the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a test due to his own insecurities. Is it reasonable for him to request a paternity test without any reason to suspect infidelity? \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If there's no evidence or suspicion of cheating, a paternity test might be seen as an infringement on the partner's trust. However, some might argue that it's his right to be certain about his biological relation to the child, especially since he's the one who can't know for sure. But the lack of any indication of infidelity makes his request seem baseless, which could be a problem.\n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling untrusted, which is a valid emotional response. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning, while understandable in a general sense, doesn't apply here because there's no specific reason to doubt the pregnancy. The fact that the brothers support the fianc\u00e9's stance might be influenced by their own perspectives, but the situation still raises questions about the fianc\u00e9e's right to feel trusted.\n\nOn balance, the author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request lacks justification given the context, so the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
