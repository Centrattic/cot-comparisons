He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which angers the author. They argue, and the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he has no specific reason to suspect her of cheating, he's worried about the possibility, referencing other men who've been in similar situations. The author feels untrusted, and her brothers support her view that since the baby is coming from her body, it's his to doubt. They also mention trust expectations.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test without evidence, which feels like a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reason is that he's protecting himself from a potential situation where he's raising a child that isn't his, which he's seen happen to others. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in terms of expectations of trust, it's a common belief that partners should trust each other without needing proof. The fianc\u00e9's request might be seen as a breach of that trust. However, on the other hand, some people argue that in cases where there's no prior trust or specific reasons, wanting a paternity test isn't unreasonable. The fianc\u00e9 might be acting out of fear rather than distrust.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable; being accused without cause can hurt. The brothers' comments support the idea that the author's perspective is valid. The question is whether expecting trust is reasonable. If there's no history of infidelity or red flags, then the fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as unnecessary and untrustful. But if he's just being cautious, then maybe there's a different angle.\n\nIn many relationships, trust is a two-way street. The author might be expecting her fianc\u00e9 to trust her as she trusts him. However, the fianc\u00e9's need for a paternity test implies that he has doubts, even if unspoken, which the author might feel isn't justified. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9 had any legitimate reason. Since he doesn't, his request seems to stem from fear or past experiences rather than current circumstances. That lack of trust without cause could be seen as the issue.\n\nSo, considering that the author has no history of cheating and the fianc\u00e9 has no reason to suspect her, the request for a paternity test might be unreasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry and expecting trust. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be the problem here, making the author not the asshole. But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing. Maybe the fianc\u00e9's stance is that he's just being cautious, but the author feels it's a breach of trust. Since trust is fundamental in relationships, expecting it is reasonable. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
