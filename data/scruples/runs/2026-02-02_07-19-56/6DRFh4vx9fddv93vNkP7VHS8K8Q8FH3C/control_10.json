He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me.

We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author is pregnant and feels that their fianc\u00e9 is not trusting them. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men have trusted their partners and ended up raising children that weren't theirs. The author's brothers back up the idea that if the baby is coming from her body, then the fianc\u00e9 should trust that she's faithful, especially if there's no evidence of infidelity.\n\nSo, from a typical standpoint, trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. If there's no indication that the author has been unfaithful, then the fianc\u00e9's request might come off as distrustful. However, some people might argue that the fianc\u00e9 is just being cautious or has had experiences that make him worry. But the author's point is that there's no reason to suspect her of cheating, and the fianc\u00e9 acknowledges that the other men also had no reason. \n\nThe brothers' comments seem to support the author's position, emphasizing mutual trust. The fianc\u00e9 is in a position where he can't know for sure the baby's parentage, but the author is the one who can confirm it. The fianc\u00e9's request might be about his own insecurities or fears, which might not be the author's fault. But the argument is about whether the author has a right to expect trust. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's more common for the female partner to be doubted in such situations, and the male partner's insistence on a paternity test can be seen as problematic. Unless there's a legitimate reason (like a medical history or known infidelity), the request for a test without evidence might be considered an issue of trust. The author's anger is a valid reaction to perceived distrust. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he wants to ensure the child is his. While that's a personal concern, it's also important to consider that paternity tests are typically used when there's a real question about the biological father. If the author is the one who can confirm the baby is his (assuming they are in a monogamous relationship and the pregnancy resulted from their union), then the request is unnecessary and undermines trust. \n\nThere's a potential double standard here. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about being tricked, but the author is carrying the pregnancy, which inherently involves more personal and physical risk. The fianc\u00e9's demand for a test without evidence might not be fair. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The fianc\u00e9's decision to want a test without a valid reason could be the issue. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
