He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. She's four months pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the baby. She's upset because she feels it's a lack of trust. He argues that even though he doesn't have specific reasons to suspect her, others have been cheated on without knowing, so he wants the test. Her brothers support her viewpoint, saying since the baby comes from her, he can't know for sure, and she's asking for trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and the reasons for wanting the test. She feels wronged because she's been faithful and he's not giving her the trust. He's worried about the possibility of not being the father, even without evidence. \n\nIs wanting a paternity test without any suspicion unreasonable? Well, trust in a relationship is important. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, then demanding a test could be seen as distrustful. However, some people might feel anxious or insecure, especially if they have heard stories of others being deceived. \n\nBut from her perspective, she's giving him something he can't reciprocate\u2014she knows the baby is his because it's hers, but he can't know unless tested. That's a unique situation. However, she might be expecting him to trust her without any proof. \n\nIs her anger justified? She might feel that his request is a breach of trust. On the other hand, if he's genuinely insecure, is it her fault? But if there's no reason to suspect her, then his demand might be unreasonable. \n\nHer brothers' perspective is that she's asking for a level of trust he can't give. That makes sense because she has inherent trust in her own situation, while he doesn't. But in a healthy relationship, trust is usually given without needing proof. Unless there's a history of infidelity or specific reasons for distrust, a paternity test request could be seen as a lack of trust. \n\nSo, considering all this, the fianc\u00e9's request might be inconsiderate and based on unfounded fears. The author's anger is a valid reaction to feeling untrusted without cause. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
