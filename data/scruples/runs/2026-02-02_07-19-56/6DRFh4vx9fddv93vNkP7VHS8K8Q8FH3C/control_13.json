He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a fianc\u00e9e who's upset because her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. The fianc\u00e9 says he wants to be sure, citing other men who trusted their partners and ended up raising kids not theirs. The author feels disrespected and untrusted, especially since there's no reason to suspect infidelity. Her brothers back her up, saying she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her, but he can't know for sure. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She's pregnant and her fianc\u00e9 wants a test. She's angry because she feels he doesn't trust her. She points out there's no reason to suspect her, implying that his request is based on fear of others' experiences rather than any real evidence. Her brothers support her, emphasizing the inherent trust from her side since she knows the baby is his biologically, but he can't know without a test. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side: He's asking for a paternity test, possibly to prevent a situation where he ends up raising someone else's child. He's using others' experiences as justification. The author argues that those men had no reason to suspect their partners either, so his reasoning might be based on a general distrust or fear rather than specific circumstances.\n\nKey points to consider: Trust in a relationship is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's request might stem from fear, but it's causing tension. The author feels the request is baseless and a breach of trust. The brothers' advice highlights the asymmetry in certainty\u2014the author knows the baby is his, but he doesn't, hence the need for a test. However, expecting trust without evidence from both sides could be an issue. \n\nIn many relationships, partners are expected to trust each other unless there's a reason not to. The fianc\u00e9's request without any indication of infidelity could be seen as lacking trust. On the other hand, the author might be dismissing his valid concerns about paternity, which is a big responsibility. But if there's no evidence, maybe his request is unwarranted. \n\nThe question is if the author is wrong for expecting trust. The fianc\u00e9's action of wanting a test could be seen as not trusting her, which is a breach of mutual trust. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset by his lack of trust, especially since there's no reason to doubt her. Her brothers' support reinforces that she's in a position of inherent trust, which he's not. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's justified in feeling that his request is a breach of trust without cause. The fianc\u00e9's action is the problem here, not the author's reaction.\n"
