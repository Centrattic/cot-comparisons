He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men trusted their partners and ended up raising kids that weren't theirs. The author's brothers support her, saying the baby is coming from her body, so he should trust her.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 is requesting a paternity test. The author feels this is an affront to her trust, while the fianc\u00e9 is worried about being cheated on. The brothers' input adds another layer, emphasizing that the author can be sure of the baby's origin, but the fianc\u00e9 can't.\n\nIs it reasonable for the fianc\u00e9 to want a paternity test? Well, in some cases, men do request tests out of fear, even without evidence. But in this case, the author isn't accused of cheating; the fianc\u00e9 just states that lots of men have been deceived. The author might feel that the request is baseless. But the fianc\u00e9's stance is that he's not willing to take the risk. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for expecting trust. The fianc\u00e9 isn't providing a specific reason for his suspicion, just a general fear. The author might argue that without evidence, the request is unfair. However, trust is a mutual expectation in relationships. If the fianc\u00e9 is struggling with trust, maybe the author is right to be hurt. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as a personal boundary he's setting for himself, which might not be entirely unreasonable. \n\nBut then, the brothers' perspective is that the author is in the right. They say he should trust her because she can be sure. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning might be more about his own insecurities or past experiences rather than the author's actions. Is the author at fault for not understanding that? Or is the fianc\u00e9 overstepping by not trusting her unless proven otherwise? \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's fianc\u00e9 has a legitimate reason to be concerned. If there's no evidence of infidelity, then the request might stem from his own lack of trust, which is his issue, not hers. The author isn't cheating, so expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on a paternity test could be seen as a refusal to trust her, which is unfair if there's no basis for it. The author's anger makes sense because being asked to prove paternity without cause can be hurtful and damaging to the relationship. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the right, and the fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong for not trusting her without evidence. The author isn't at fault for expecting trust from her partner.\n"
