He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that many men have been tricked into raising kids that aren't theirs. The author's family suggests that the fianc\u00e9 is being untrustworthy since the author knows the baby is theirs, while the fianc\u00e9 can't be sure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about trust and feeling disrespected. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test might stem from fear or past experiences, maybe not necessarily distrust but a precaution. However, in a relationship, trust is fundamental. If there's no evidence of infidelity, the request might be seen as unjustified. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 could be reacting to societal issues where men have been deceived, so his concern isn't entirely without basis.\n\nThe author's family points out that since the author can confirm the baby's parentage through their own certainty, the fianc\u00e9's request might be based on a lack of trust. The author is asking if their expectation of trust is reasonable. Trust is a two-way street, so expecting trust without reciprocating could be an issue. However, the fianc\u00e9 is seeking reassurance, which might be a problem if there's no reason to suspect infidelity.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In many relationships, trust is paramount, and unless there's a valid reason (like past infidelity or specific circumstances), a paternity test request might be seen as a breach of trust. The author's anger is a valid emotional response to feeling untrusted. The fianc\u00e9, however, might be trying to protect himself, but his approach could be causing harm to the relationship by making the author feel doubted.\n\nAnother angle: sometimes when people request paternity tests, it's not just about infidelity but about legal or financial reasons. However, the context here is about trust. The author's brothers argue that the fianc\u00e9's request is unfair because the author can't be sure of the other parent's identity (though in reality, the author knows, as the fianc\u00e9 is the only partner). Wait, the author says \"it\u2019s coming out of my body,\" implying the fianc\u00e9 is the only possible father. So the fianc\u00e9's request seems baseless unless there's something else.\n\nIn that case, the author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request for a test without any evidence of cheating is distrustful. The author is not the asshole for being angry about that. The fianc\u00e9 is the one not trusting their partner without cause, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
