He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9's partner) is in the wrong for being angry at her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the key points: The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The author feels he doesn't trust her. He argues that even though he has no reason to suspect her, other men have been deceived. The author's brothers support her, emphasizing that she knows the baby is his since it's hers, but he can't know for sure. They mention the expectation of trust.\n\nSo, considering trust in a relationship. Typically, trust is a fundamental component. If there's no evidence or suspicion of infidelity, demanding a paternity test might seem unnecessary. The author's argument is about mutual trust\u2014she expects him to trust her without requiring proof. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about a possible future scenario, even if it's unfounded. \n\nThe brothers' points highlight the asymmetry in certainty. The author knows the baby is his, but he can't be sure until the test. However, in most relationships, unless there's a history of infidelity or specific concerns, such a test would be seen as a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is based on hypothetical scenarios others have faced, but that doesn't necessarily justify his action here, especially without any concrete reason. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling untrusted. Trust is usually presumed unless there's a reason to doubt. The fianc\u00e9's request might be seen as distrustful, making the author's reaction reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
