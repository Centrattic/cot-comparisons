He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is angry about it, feeling it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he doesn't want to raise someone else's child if there was infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author might feel that the request is a breach of trust, which is reasonable. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't unfounded. There are cases where people have discovered that their children aren't biologically theirs after the fact, which could lead to significant emotional and financial consequences. So his desire for a paternity test is a precaution, maybe to protect himself in case of unforeseen circumstances.\n\nBut the key here is the context. The author mentions there's no reason for the fianc\u00e9 to suspect her of cheating. If there's no history of infidelity or any indication that the author has been unfaithful, then the request for a paternity test could be seen as unnecessary and distrustful. The brothers' advice seems to suggest that the author's position is valid because she knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 can't have that certainty without a test. However, the author's expectation of mutual trust is reasonable. In a healthy relationship, both partners should trust each other unless there's a valid reason not to. The fianc\u00e9's request without any evidence might be seen as a lack of trust without cause, which is why the author is justified in feeling hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that he's protecting himself. But in many relationships, trust is assumed unless there's a reason to doubt. If there's no reason to doubt, then the request for a paternity test might be an overreach. The author isn't doing anything to warrant suspicion, so the fianc\u00e9's stance could be considered unreasonable in this context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. Expecting trust is reasonable, especially in the absence of any evidence to the contrary. The fianc\u00e9's decision to ask for a paternity test without any basis for suspicion might make him the one at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
