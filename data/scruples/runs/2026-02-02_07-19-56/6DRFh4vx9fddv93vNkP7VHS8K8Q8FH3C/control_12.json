He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The author is 4 months pregnant and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. She's upset because she feels he doesn't trust her. He argues that even if others have trusted their partners and been wronged, he can't have 100% certainty unless he tests. They argued, and her brothers said similar things: he can't know the baby is his unless tested, and she's expecting trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nFirst, the question is about trust in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's request is about verifying paternity, which is a common concern in some situations. But the author is hurt because she feels her trust is being doubted. She hasn't done anything to suspect cheating, so from her perspective, his request is baseless and distrustful.\n\nFrom the fianc\u00e9's side, he might feel that without a test, he can't be sure. Even if there's no indication, the idea of potentially raising a child that's not his could be a big deal. His reasoning is that trust is one-sided\u2014he can't know for sure, while she can be certain. His brothers support this view, emphasizing that certainty requires a test.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are mutual trust in a relationship. Expecting trust is usually a reasonable expectation. If there's no evidence of infidelity, the fianc\u00e9's request might be seen as unnecessary and damaging to the relationship's trust. On the other hand, his desire for certainty could be driven by fear of being deceived in the future.\n\nBut in most relationships, trust is foundational. Without proof of betrayal, the request for a paternity test can be seen as a breach of that trust. The author's anger is a valid reaction to feeling untrusted. However, the fianc\u00e9's stance is based on his inability to be certain, which is a real issue. However, in the absence of any evidence, his lack of trust might be unreasonable.\n\nThe brothers' comments suggest that the author's expectation of trust is one-sided. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should be able to trust each other. If one partner can't trust the other without proof, that's a problem. The author isn't wrong for feeling hurt; expecting trust is normal. The fianc\u00e9's request might be his way of managing fear, but it's not reasonable without cause.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on fear and lack of proof, but without any indication of infidelity, his lack of trust is the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
