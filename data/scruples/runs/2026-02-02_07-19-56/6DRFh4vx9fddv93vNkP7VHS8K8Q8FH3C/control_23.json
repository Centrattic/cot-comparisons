He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author is a pregnant fianc\u00e9e who's angry because her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. He's concerned about possible infidelity, even though she claims there's no reason to suspect her of cheating. They had an argument, and her brothers commented on the asymmetry of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author feels disrespected and untrusting because her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. She's pregnant, so she might feel vulnerable. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is worried about being wronged by raising a child that's not his. That's a valid concern for some people, even if it's based on hypothetical scenarios. \n\nThe brothers' comments highlight the difference in how trust is perceived between genders. The author can physically confirm the baby's origin, but the fianc\u00e9 can't, which creates an imbalance in trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test might stem from past experiences or fears, which are common in some men. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9 has no concrete suspicion, his request could be seen as distrustful. But if he's acting out of fear rather than suspicion, maybe it's a different angle. The author expects trust, which is reasonable in a healthy relationship. If he's not providing that trust without reason, that could be an issue. However, his concern isn't entirely baseless; some people do cheat, and the fear of being wronged exists. \n\nBut the key here is the lack of any actual suspicion. The fianc\u00e9's argument is that \"lots of men trusted and later found out,\" but that's a generalization. Without specific reasons, the test request might be an overreaction. The author's anger is about the lack of trust, which is a valid feeling. \n\nThe brothers' advice points out the asymmetry in trust\u2014she can confirm the baby's origin, but he can't. So expecting him to trust her without the same level of certainty might be unfair. However, in most relationships, trust is a mutual effort. If one person has no reason to doubt, the other's demand for proof could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's expecting trust without the same empirical proof for him, maybe. But if there's no suspicion, his request is baseless. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship dynamics. In some contexts, wanting a paternity test without reason is a red flag. In others, it's a precaution. \n\nGiven the situation, the author's anger is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's request seems to lack justification, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
