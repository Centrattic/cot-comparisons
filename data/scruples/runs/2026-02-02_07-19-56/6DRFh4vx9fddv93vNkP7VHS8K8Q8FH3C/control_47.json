He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong because he wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The fianc\u00e9 is angry that the author wants a test, feeling it's a lack of trust. The author argues that he's just being cautious, since others have been deceived before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The author's fianc\u00e9 is upset because he feels untrusting. But trust is a two-way street. If the author is asking for a paternity test without any suspicion, that might indicate he doesn't trust his partner's faithfulness. However, the author mentions that he has no reason to suspect the fianc\u00e9 of cheating. So, is it reasonable to request a paternity test just out of paranoia?\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's argument is that the author is asking for trust, and the author isn't reciprocating. The brothers' comments support the idea that the author can't know for sure, but the fianc\u00e9 can. That might suggest the author's request is unnecessary. But does that make the author the asshole? \n\nI should also think about the impact on the relationship. Constant demands for proof can erode trust. If there's no evidence of infidelity, the request might be seen as controlling or distrustful. However, if the author has past experiences or fears, maybe there's a valid reason. But the scenario doesn't mention any such history. \n\nSo, the key points are: mutual trust, the reasonableness of the paternity test request without evidence, and the effect on the relationship. The author's action might be seen as a breach of trust if there's no justification. The fianc\u00e9's anger is a reaction to feeling untrusted. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's requesting a test without cause, which the fianc\u00e9 finds hurtful. The author's brothers also point out the asymmetry in trust. Therefore, the author's request might not be justified, making him the asshole.\n"
