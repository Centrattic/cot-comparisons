He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's angry that their partner wants a paternity test. The key points are about trust and expectations in the relationship.\n\nFirst, the situation: the partner wants a paternity test for the unborn child. The author feels this is distrustful, while the partner argues that even trusted partners might find out later. The author's family supports the idea that the partner's request is unnecessary since the author knows the baby is theirs. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Trust is a two-way street in relationships. The partner's request might stem from fear of being deceived, even if there's no evidence. But the author feels disrespected and untrusted. The partner's justification is that others have been surprised before, which is a valid concern. However, without any indication of infidelity, the request could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe family's perspective is that the partner should trust the author since they know the baby is theirs. But trust isn't always about evidence; it's about mutual belief in each other. The partner might not have that trust, even if there's no reason to doubt. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting trust? If there's no history of cheating, the partner's request might be unreasonable. However, the partner's fear isn't entirely unfounded. But in a healthy relationship, trust is assumed unless there's a reason not to. The author's anger is about feeling untrusted, which is a legitimate reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, the partner's request for a paternity test without any suspicion could be seen as a lack of trust. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset by that. The partner's actions might be causing unnecessary hurt. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't the one at fault here. The partner's request is based on fear rather than evidence, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
