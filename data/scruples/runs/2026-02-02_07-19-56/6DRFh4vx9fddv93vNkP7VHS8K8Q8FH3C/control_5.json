He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is angry about it. The author feels the fianc\u00e9 doesn't trust her, while the fianc\u00e9 argues that even if other men trusted their partners, some ended up raising kids that weren't theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is pregnant, and the baby is hers biologically, so she might feel that the paternity test is unnecessary. She's probably hurt because the request implies a lack of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is worried about possibly raising a child that's not his. That's a valid concern for him, even if there's no evidence of infidelity. The brothers' comments support the author's point, saying the fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable because the author knows the baby is his (since it's hers), but he doesn't. The older brother's point about mutual trust is interesting too. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are trust in a relationship and the reasons for wanting a paternity test. If there's no suspicion of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's request might be based on fear or anxiety rather than facts. However, it's his right to seek reassurance, even if it's unnecessary. But the author's feeling of being mistrusted is also valid. \n\nIn some cases, a paternity test is a reasonable request if there's a history of infidelity or other red flags. But here, the fianc\u00e9 says there's no reason to suspect her. So he's making a general precaution. The author expects trust, which is a fundamental part of a relationship. If he's not providing that, it could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author might not be considering his anxiety or fears. \n\nI think the answer depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If the author has been faithful and the fianc\u00e9 is just being overly cautious, then he might be the one being unreasonable. The author's reaction is justified if she feels untrusting. However, if the fianc\u00e9's request is based on past experiences or personal fears, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But since there's no evidence of cheating, the author might not be in the wrong. The brothers' support suggests that the fianc\u00e9's request is not reasonable in this context. So, the author is not in the wrong here because expecting trust is reasonable, and the fianc\u00e9's request is without cause. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
