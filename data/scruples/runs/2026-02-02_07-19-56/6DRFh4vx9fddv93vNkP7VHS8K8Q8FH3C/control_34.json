He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for getting angry at their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a test for the unborn child, and the author feels it's a trust issue. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even if men trust their partners, sometimes they end up with kids not theirs. The author's brothers argue that the fianc\u00e9 has no reason to suspect her, but he can't know the baby is his unless tested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is about trust and feeling disrespected. The fianc\u00e9's side is about his own uncertainty and wanting to avoid a situation where he raises a child not his own. The question is whether the author is the asshole here. \n\nTrust is a big part of relationships. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, then demanding a paternity test could be seen as not trusting the partner. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have been in similar situations without suspicion and still ended up in a mess. So he's trying to protect himself, maybe out of fear or past experiences.\n\nThe author's anger is about feeling untrusting. But the fianc\u00e9's request is based on his own uncertainty, not necessarily on distrust. The brothers' point is that the author can't know the baby is hers, but the fianc\u00e9 can't know it's his. But that's a bit of a stretch since she's the one carrying it. However, maybe she's certain about their sexual history, so the need for a test might not be justified here.\n\nIs it reasonable for the fianc\u00e9 to want a paternity test? If there's no indication of infidelity, it might not be. The author has a right to expect trust. If the fianc\u00e9 can't provide that trust without evidence, then maybe he's overstepping. So the author's anger is justified because he's making a demand that's based on his own fear without any reason to doubt her. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
