He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is upset because it feels like a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even though he has no reason to suspect infidelity, he wants the test just in case. The author's brothers say that the author is expecting trust that they can't reciprocate because he can't know for sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author feels that the request is a breach of trust, which is a valid emotional response. Trust is fundamental in a relationship, and demanding something like a paternity test without any evidence could be seen as distrustful. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the possibility of not being the biological father, which might stem from a place of fear or past experiences. The brothers' point is that the author can't know for sure about paternity, while the author can be certain about maternity. But the author is in a position where they can be certain of their own pregnancy, but the child's father is someone else\u2014so the biological certainty isn't mutual here.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship dynamics. In many cases, expecting a partner to trust you without evidence is reasonable, especially if there's no prior issues. The fianc\u00e9's request seems preemptive without any indication of infidelity, which can be seen as a lack of trust. However, the author might also be in a position where they can't provide the same level of certainty to the fianc\u00e9. This creates a conflict because trust is a two-way street. The author is upset because they feel the trust isn't reciprocal, and the fianc\u00e9 is acting out of uncertainty.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's reaction is understandable. Feeling hurt and angry when someone you're close to doesn't trust you is valid. The fianc\u00e9's request might be reasonable from his perspective, but it's also important to consider how it affects the relationship. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the request might be unwarranted. However, the author's expectation of trust is also valid. The key here is that the fianc\u00e9 is making a request that could be perceived as distrustful without a clear reason, which is a problem.\n\nThe brothers' argument that the author can't give back the same trust because they can't know for sure about the paternity is a bit of a stretch. The author's trust is based on their own knowledge of the situation, whereas the fianc\u00e9's uncertainty is about something he can't verify without a test. But in a healthy relationship, trust is assumed unless there's a reason to doubt. So the fianc\u00e9's demand for a test without any cause might be unreasonable. The author isn't at fault for expecting trust, especially if they're not cheating. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
