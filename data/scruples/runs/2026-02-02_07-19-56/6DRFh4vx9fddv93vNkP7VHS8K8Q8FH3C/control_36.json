He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: The fianc\u00e9e is pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. She's upset because she feels it's a lack of trust. He argues that even if there's no suspicion, others have been betrayed without knowing. They argue, and her brothers back him up, saying she knows the baby is his, but he doesn't. Her brother adds that she can't give him the same trust he can give her.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and mutual expectations. The fianc\u00e9 wants to ensure the child is his, which some might see as a protective measure. But the author feels disrespected. \n\nThe brothers' perspective is that the author is asking for trust without offering the same. That's a classic trust dynamic where both partners need to feel secure. If one person demands trust without providing it in return, it can create imbalance. \n\nBut in this case, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from past experiences or fear of being misled. However, the author is in a position where she knows the baby is his (since she's the one who's pregnant), so she's not asking for something reciprocal. She's expecting trust. \n\nWait, the brothers say that she can't give him the same trust because she knows the baby is his. But that's not quite right. The trust issue here is about him trusting her fidelity. The author isn't asking for a paternity test; she's being asked to provide proof. So if there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the request could be seen as undermining her trustworthiness. \n\nOn the other hand, if the fianc\u00e9 is genuinely worried due to past experiences or societal stories, maybe his reasoning is flawed. But the problem is that without any actual suspicion, he's choosing to distrust her. That's a breach of trust. \n\nIn relationships, mutual trust is crucial. If one partner acts as if the other might be unfaithful without evidence, it can be hurtful. The author's anger is a valid reaction to being questioned without reason. Her brothers' advice might not fully consider the emotional impact of the request. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The fianc\u00e9's request seems to stem from distrust without justification, and the author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The brothers' argument might be missing the emotional aspect here. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole in this scenario.\n"
