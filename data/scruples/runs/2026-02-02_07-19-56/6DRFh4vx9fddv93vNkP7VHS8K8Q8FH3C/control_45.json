He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant fianc\u00e9e who's upset that her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he has no reason to suspect her of cheating, he's heard of cases where men are deceived. The author feels this is a breach of trust, while her brothers argue that since the baby comes from her, she can be certain, but he can't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations of trust in a relationship. Generally, in a committed relationship, especially a marriage or engagement, mutual trust is fundamental. If there's no evidence of infidelity, asking for a paternity test might be seen as distrustful. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be trying to protect himself from potential future issues if there's any doubt. However, the absence of any actual suspicion makes his request seem baseless. The author's reaction is about feeling untrusted, which is a valid emotional response. Her brothers' points highlight the asymmetry in certainty between genders regarding paternity, but that doesn't necessarily justify the request if there's no reason to doubt. \n\nIs it reasonable for him to want the test? If there's no indication of cheating, then no. Trust is a two-way street, and constant suspicion without cause can erode a relationship. The author isn't the asshole here because she's justified in feeling her trust is unreciprocated. The fianc\u00e9's request undermines the foundation of trust needed in a committed partnership. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
