He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their fianc\u00e9 for wanting a paternity test. So, the author is a woman, four months pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the baby. She feels he doesn't trust her, and he responds by saying other men have been fooled even when they trusted their partners. They argue, she goes to her parents, then talks to her brothers who say that since the baby is coming from her, he can't know for sure unless tested, and that she's asking for trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nFirst, the key points here are trust in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The author is upset because she feels this is a lack of trust. He argues that it's not uncommon for men to be deceived in such situations. The brothers' comments add another layer: they say he can't be sure unless tested, and that she's expecting trust without being in a position to reciprocate it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about societal norms and relationship dynamics. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship. If one partner is questioning the other's fidelity without any evidence, that could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9 might have his reasons\u2014maybe past experiences, or just being cautious. But in this case, the author states that there's no reason to suspect her of cheating. The fianc\u00e9's response is based on hypothetical scenarios, not actual evidence. \n\nThe brothers' perspective is interesting. They argue that the fianc\u00e9 is in a position where he can't know for sure unless tested, and that the author is expecting trust without being able to give it back. But does that justify his request for a paternity test? Well, if there's no indication of infidelity, then the request might be seen as unnecessary and distrustful. On the other hand, maybe the fianc\u00e9 is just being cautious, but that doesn't make it right if it's causing unnecessary harm to the relationship. \n\nIn many relationships, the presumption of fidelity is mutual. If there's no reason to doubt, then the request for a test could be seen as undermining the trust that the relationship is built on. The author's reaction is understandable because it's hurtful to be suspected of cheating without cause. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning, while he's trying to protect himself, might not be valid in this scenario. \n\nAlso, considering the context of pregnancy, the emotional stakes are high. The author is already in a vulnerable position, and the fianc\u00e9's request could be adding unnecessary stress. The brothers' comments might be trying to rationalize the situation, but they might not be considering the emotional impact. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's justified in feeling hurt and angry because the request for a paternity test, without any evidence of infidelity, is a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9 is in a position where he can't know unless tested, but if there's no reason to suspect her, his request is unwarranted. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
