He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a test despite no evidence of infidelity. The author feels it's a lack of trust, and the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have been tricked before.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective is that they've done nothing to warrant suspicion, and the request feels like a breach of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is expressing a concern that many people have, even if unfounded in this case. The brothers support the author's viewpoint, emphasizing that the author can be certain of the baby's origin while the fianc\u00e9 can't.\n\nBut is it reasonable for the fianc\u00e9 to want a test without any indication of cheating? Trust is a cornerstone of relationships. If there's no evidence, then the request might be seen as a lack of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning isn't entirely baseless\u2014some people do face this situation. But that doesn't make it justified here. The author's anger stems from feeling untrusted, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9 might need to address his trust issues without making the author feel accused. So the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust. The answer is B.\n"
