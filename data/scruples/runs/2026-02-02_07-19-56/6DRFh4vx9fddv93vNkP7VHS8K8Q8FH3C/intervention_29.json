He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry about her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a test for the unborn child, which upsets her because it feels like a lack of trust. He argues that many men have been deceived in the past, even without suspicion. The fianc\u00e9e's brothers support her, saying she knows the baby is his since it's hers, but he can't know for sure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Trust is a big part of any relationship. The fianc\u00e9e feels betrayed because the request seems like distrust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has valid concerns based on real-life situations where people have been deceived. He might be trying to protect himself from a potential future problem.\n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and communication. The author's anger is understandable because she feels untrusting. However, the fianc\u00e9's request isn't necessarily unreasonable. He's not accusing her of cheating but is taking a precaution. But the way it's handled matters. If he raised this without any suspicion, maybe he should have considered how it might affect her feelings.\n\nThe brothers' perspective adds another layer. They suggest that the author can't fully understand the fianc\u00e9's position because she knows the baby is his. That's a common dynamic where one partner has certainty the other can't have. However, that doesn't mean the fianc\u00e9e's feelings are invalid. She's in a vulnerable position being pregnant and might feel disrespected.\n\nIs it reasonable for the fianc\u00e9 to want a paternity test? It depends on the context. Without any reason to suspect infidelity, it might come off as unnecessary and hurtful. However, he's not wrong for having concerns. The issue might be more about how the request was communicated rather than the request itself.\n\nSo, who is in the wrong? The author's anger is a reaction to feeling untrusted, which is valid. But she might be expecting a level of trust that isn't reciprocal. If the fianc\u00e9 had a genuine reason, he could be justified, but without any suspicion, it might be overstepping. The author's response of getting angry and leaving is a natural emotional reaction, but maybe she could have addressed it differently. However, the fianc\u00e9's request without any basis might be the root of the problem here.\n\nIn conclusion, while both sides have valid points, the fianc\u00e9's request without any suspicion could be seen as distrustful and hurtful, which makes the author's reaction understandable. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
