He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry at her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn child. The author feels this is a breach of trust because there's no reason to suspect infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have trusted their partners and later found out the child wasn't theirs. The author's brothers think it's reasonable for the fianc\u00e9 to want the test since he can't be sure, while the author expects trust from him.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust in a relationship and the expectation of that trust. The author is upset because she feels untrusted. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about potential future issues that others have faced. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is fundamental. If one partner is making assumptions without evidence, that could be problematic. However, the fianc\u00e9's concern might stem from a fear of being deceived, which is a valid emotion for some people. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author expects trust, which is reasonable. However, her fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test might be based on his own anxiety or past experiences. \n\nThe brothers' perspectives are that the author can confirm the baby's parentage because she's the one giving birth, but the fianc\u00e9 can't. So, they argue that the author is expecting a level of trust that she can't reciprocate. \n\nBut here's the thing: in most cases, unless there's a specific reason to doubt the paternity (like a history of infidelity or other red flags), expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request without any basis might be seen as a lack of trust. However, people have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable without proof. \n\nIn some cultures or personal beliefs, the presumption of paternity is automatic unless there's evidence otherwise. But others might take a more cautious approach. \n\nThe author's anger stems from feeling untrusted, which is a valid reaction. The fianc\u00e9's request might be a way to alleviate his own fears, but it's causing conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, then the fianc\u00e9's request might be unreasonable. The author is justified in feeling hurt. However, the fianc\u00e9 might be in a difficult position where he's trying to protect himself, even if the method is causing tension. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because trust is a two-way street. If the fianc\u00e9 can't offer trust without proof, that could indicate deeper issues in the relationship. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable, and the fianc\u00e9's request, without any evidence, might be the issue here. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
