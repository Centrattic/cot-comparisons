He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child, which makes the author feel untrusted. He argues that even though there's no suspicion, others have been deceived. The author's brothers side with her, saying she knows the baby is his because it's hers, but he can't be sure. The key issue here is trust and the reasons behind the request.\n\nIs the fianc\u00e9's request reasonable? Paternity tests can be a sensitive topic. If there's no evidence of infidelity, then the request might be based on insecurity rather than facts. The author has a right to feel hurt and distrust if her partner can't trust her without proof. The brothers' point about mutual trust is important; if she expects trust from him, he might need that from her as well. However, since she's certain about the paternity and he isn't, his request could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut wait, maybe the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is flawed. He's using hypothetical scenarios to justify his request without any real evidence. That could be a sign of lack of trust or overthinking. The author's anger is a valid reaction because trust is fundamental in a relationship. If he can't trust her without a test, it might indicate deeper issues. \n\nHowever, some might argue that wanting a paternity test is a personal decision. But in this case, there's no indication of betrayal. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on a test without cause could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling wronged. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on unfounded suspicions, so the author's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
