He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son.\n\nFirst, the context: She's 4 months pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. She's upset because it feels like he doesn't trust her. He responds that even men who trust their partners can end up in situations where the child isn't theirs. They argue, she goes to her parents, and her brothers give their opinions. Her brothers argue that she knows the baby is his because it's hers, but he doesn't. Her older brother says she's expecting trust that he can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, the main issue is about trust. The fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test, which the fianc\u00e9e sees as a lack of trust. He's trying to protect himself, maybe from a worst-case scenario. But she feels his request is unfair because she hasn't given him any reason to doubt her fidelity. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a two-way street. The fianc\u00e9e expects trust from her partner, which is reasonable. However, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't entirely irrational. There's a documented history of infidelity leading to paternity issues, so his fear isn't baseless. But does that justify wanting a test without evidence? It might be a way to manage his anxiety, but it could also be seen as not trusting her when there's no indication of cheating.\n\nHer brothers' points are interesting. They imply that she can be certain of the child's parentage because she's the one carrying it, but he can't. So he's asking for validation that she can't provide. But she's not the one who can confirm the paternity, so expecting her to be 100% certain without evidence is a bit of a logical inconsistency. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision to ask for a test might be based on his own insecurities or past experiences, not necessarily any real betrayal from her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's upset because she feels disrespected. Her reaction is valid if there's no reason for him to doubt her. If the fianc\u00e9 can't trust her without evidence, that's an issue in the relationship. On the other hand, his request might stem from a place of trying to protect himself, but it's possible that his approach is causing more harm by undermining trust.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, expecting trust is generally seen as a healthy part of a relationship. Wanting a paternity test without any suspicion could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the fianc\u00e9 has legitimate reasons (though not in this case), it's a different story. Here, he doesn't have any reason to suspect her, so his request might be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author's anger is justified because she hasn't done anything to warrant a paternity test. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on hypothetical scenarios rather than actual evidence. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
