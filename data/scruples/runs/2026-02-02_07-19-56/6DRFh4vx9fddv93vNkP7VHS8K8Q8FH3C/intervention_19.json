He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The author feels this is a lack of trust, especially since there's no reason to suspect infidelity. The fianc\u00e9 counters by saying that even trusted men have been surprised by infidelity. The author's brothers support her view, emphasizing her certainty about the baby's parentage and the expectation of trust.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to evaluate both sides. From the author's perspective, expecting trust is reasonable. If there's no suspicion, a paternity test might seem unnecessary and distrustful. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern might stem from past experiences or fears of being deceived, which he might not have control over. \n\nBut in a healthy relationship, trust is foundational. If there's no evidence of cheating, demanding a test can be seen as a breach of trust. The author's anger is a reaction to feeling disrespected. However, the fianc\u00e9 might be acting out of fear or past trauma, which he hasn't addressed. \n\nThe brothers' advice makes sense too. The author inherently knows the baby is theirs, but the husband doesn't. So he's dealing with uncertainty. However, in the absence of any indication of infidelity, the request for a test seems unreasonable. The author's expectation of trust is valid, and the fianc\u00e9's action could be seen as undermining the relationship's trust. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request is problematic if there's no reason to suspect cheating. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
