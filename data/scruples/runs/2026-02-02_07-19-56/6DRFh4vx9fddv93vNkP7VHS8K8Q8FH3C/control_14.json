He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully. The author is 4 months pregnant and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. She's angry because she feels he doesn't trust her. He argues that even though he has no reason to suspect her of cheating, other men have been deceived like that. She left to cool down, talked to her brothers, who said that since she knows the baby is his (because it's coming from her), he can't know unless tested. Her older brother says she expects a level of trust from him that she can't reciprocate.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is the asshole for expecting trust, or if the fianc\u00e9 is being reasonable in wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, let's consider the trust aspect. Trust in a relationship is crucial. The author is upset because she feels untrusting on his part. On the other hand, he's worried about a scenario where he might be raising someone else's child. That's a valid concern from his perspective, but how reasonable is it without any suspicion? He mentions that other men have been in similar situations without any indication, which is a common fear but might not be a rational basis for a test. \n\nThe brothers' point is interesting. The author physically knows the baby is his because she's carrying it, but the fianc\u00e9 can't know that unless tested. So from his point of view, until the test, there's a possibility of doubt. But the author argues that there's no reason to suspect her, so the test is unnecessary. \n\nIs it reasonable for him to want a test without any evidence? That's debatable. Some people might see it as a breach of trust, while others might see it as a precaution. However, requesting a paternity test without any indication of infidelity can be seen as distrustful. On the other hand, if he has anxiety or past experiences that make him fear being deceived, that might influence his decision. \n\nThe author's reaction is anger because she feels disrespected. She hasn't cheated, so she's hurt by the request. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is based on hypothetical scenarios rather than concrete evidence. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting trust. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from his own fears. But if there's no reason to suspect infidelity, then the request could be seen as unreasonable. The brothers' advice highlights the asymmetry in certainty\u2014she knows the baby is his, but he can't know until tested. However, that logic might not account for the emotional impact of his request. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't the asshole. Her fianc\u00e9's request is based on unfounded fears, and she's justified in feeling that it's a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
