He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son. The author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust, but the fianc\u00e9 is concerned about others who trusted their partners and ended up raising someone else's child. The author's brothers support the idea that the author knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't, so they should understand the need for a test.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, especially a marriage. If the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a paternity test without any evidence or suspicion, that could be seen as distrustful. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is based on stories of other men being deceived. The author might feel that their fianc\u00e9 is not trusting them, which is valid. But is the author in the wrong for expecting that trust?\n\nThe brothers' comments add another angle. They argue that the author is asking for trust they can't reciprocate. Maybe the author is in a position of certainty (knowing the baby is theirs) while the fianc\u00e9 feels uncertain. But does that justify the fianc\u00e9's demand for a test? It's about mutual trust and communication. If the author hasn't given any reason for suspicion, then the fianc\u00e9's request might be unreasonable. However, if there's a history of infidelity or other issues, that could change things. The scenario doesn't mention prior issues, so it's likely a new concern.\n\nIs the author's anger wrong? If the fianc\u00e9 is making the request without cause, the author's reaction is understandable. But if the fianc\u00e9 has legitimate concerns, even if unfounded, the author might need to address those fears respectfully. The key here is whether there's a valid reason for the paternity test. Since the author says there's no reason to suspect cheating, the fianc\u00e9's request is based on hypothetical scenarios, which might be an overreaction.\n\nIn relationships, trust is usually assumed unless there's a reason not to. The fianc\u00e9's approach could be damaging to the relationship's trust and emotional well-being. The author might have a right to be upset. However, the fianc\u00e9's anxiety could be due to personal fears or past experiences, which should be discussed. But without evidence, the demand for a test seems excessive. So, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B, No. But maybe I should check if there's a cultural or legal context. Paternity tests can have legal implications, but the main issue here is the lack of trust. The author is being asked to prove paternity, which is inherently a cisgender male's assumption, as the author is the one carrying the child. That could be a point where the fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable. So, the author isn't wrong to be angry. Answer B.\n"
