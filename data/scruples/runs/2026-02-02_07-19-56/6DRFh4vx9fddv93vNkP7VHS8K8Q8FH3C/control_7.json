He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for being angry about her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a test even though there's no suspicion of cheating, and she feels it's a trust issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author is pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 is requesting a paternity test. She's upset because she feels it shows a lack of trust. Her fianc\u00e9's argument is that many men don't suspect their partners but later find out the child isn't theirs. The brothers' opinions are that she can be certain the baby is hers (since she's giving birth), but he can't, so he's justified in wanting the test. The question is whether she's in the wrong for expecting trust.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is fundamental. If there's no indication of infidelity, the fianc\u00e9's request might be seen as a lack of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be dealing with personal insecurities or fears. The key here is that there's no evidence of cheating, so the request for a paternity test without any suspicion could be seen as unjustified. The author's anger seems reasonable because trust is a two-way street, and if one partner is asking for something that undermines trust without cause, it's valid to feel hurt.\n\nThe brothers' points about perspective are important. The author can be certain about the baby's origin, but the father can't. However, in a trusting relationship, this shouldn't be an issue unless there's a specific reason to doubt. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning about \"other men\" trusting and being wronged is a bit of a generalization. It's possible he's acting out of fear, but without specific reasons, his request might be seen as unfair. The author's expectation of trust is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling angry about this unnecessary request. The fianc\u00e9's action might stem from insecurity, but the lack of grounds for suspicion makes his request questionable. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
