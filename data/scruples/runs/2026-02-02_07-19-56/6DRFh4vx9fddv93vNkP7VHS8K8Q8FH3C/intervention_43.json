He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, and the author is angry about it. The key points to consider are trust in a relationship, the reasons behind the request, and the reactions of both partners.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test. The author feels this is a sign of mistrust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's heard of men who trusted their partners but ended up raising someone else's child. The author argues there's no reason to suspect her of cheating, and the fianc\u00e9 responds that other men didn't have reasons either. The author's brothers back her up, saying since she's the one carrying the child, she knows it's his, but he can't be sure. The author's brother also mentions she's asking for trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a healthy relationship, trust is fundamental. If there's no evidence of infidelity, demanding a paternity test might be seen as a breach of trust. The author is expecting her fianc\u00e9 to trust her without question. However, the fianc\u00e9 is voicing a fear based on stories he's heard. While his request might stem from fear or insecurity, it's important whether there's a legitimate reason for it. Since the author says there's no reason to suspect her, the fianc\u00e9's request without evidence could be seen as distrustful. On the other hand, the author might be expecting blind trust, which isn't always reasonable if there are underlying insecurities.\n\nThe brother's point is that the author can be certain (as she's carrying the child), but the fianc\u00e9 can't. That's a valid point; he can't have that same certainty. So maybe the author is expecting her fianc\u00e9 to trust her without accounting for his inability to verify the paternity himself. This might mean she's not being empathetic to his perspective. However, in the absence of any evidence or reason to doubt, the fianc\u00e9's request might be unreasonable. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author is justified in feeling hurt and seeing it as a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's fear is understandable but without basis here. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable given the circumstances, so the author's anger is a valid reaction. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
