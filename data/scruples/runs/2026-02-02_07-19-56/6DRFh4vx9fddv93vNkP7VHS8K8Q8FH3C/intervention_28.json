He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even if he doesn't have any specific reason to suspect the author of cheating, he's heard that many men end up raising kids that aren't theirs because their partners cheated. The author's brothers say it's reasonable to trust, given the biological certainty from the author's side.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the norms around trust in relationships. Generally, trust is a fundamental part of any partnership. If one person wants a test without any evidence of infidelity, that could be seen as not trusting their partner. The fianc\u00e9's argument is based on fear of a common scenario, but does that justify the request? \n\nOn the other hand, the author is right to feel hurt and mistrusted. Paternity tests are typically requested when there's a specific reason, like a history of infidelity or some medical concern. Without such a reason, it's usually considered unnecessary and damaging to trust. The brothers' point is that the author can be 100% sure of the child's parentage because they know it's theirs biologically, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be sure unless tested. However, in a committed relationship where both are in agreement that the child is theirs, testing might be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nWait, but the author is the one who is pregnant, so if they're both in the same relationship and the conception was consensual, the baby would be his. Unless there's IVF or some other factor, the biological father is the fianc\u00e9. But maybe there's a misunderstanding. The author might not have considered that the fianc\u00e9 could be worried about a different scenario, like a previous medical issue or maybe a fear of the child having health problems that might be genetic. But the story says the fianc\u00e9 didn't have any specific reason. \n\nSo the main issue here is the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test without any basis for suspicion. That's usually considered a breach of trust. The author's anger is a natural reaction to feeling untrusted. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning, while perhaps common, doesn't provide a valid justification for not trusting his partner. The author's brothers are right in saying that the author can't reciprocate the same level of trust in the fianc\u00e9 if he doesn't trust her. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for expecting trust from her fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9's request is unreasonable in the absence of any evidence or specific concerns. The answer should be B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
