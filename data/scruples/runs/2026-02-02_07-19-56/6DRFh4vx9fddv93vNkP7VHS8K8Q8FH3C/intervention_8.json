He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the situation) is in the wrong for being angry with their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. The fianc\u00e9 wants the test, and the author feels it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that other men have been tricked before.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust in a relationship and the reasons behind seeking a paternity test. The author is upset because their partner doesn't trust them. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's just being cautious, using examples of other men who were deceived. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author might feel that the request is a breach of trust, especially since there's no indication of infidelity. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's request could stem from past experiences, societal examples, or personal anxiety. \n\nBut in a healthy relationship, trust is fundamental. If there's no evidence of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's request might be seen as unnecessary suspicion. However, people have different thresholds for trust, and some might need more reassurance, even without concrete reasons. \n\nThe author's brothers suggest that the author knows the baby is theirs, which implies that the author is certain of their fidelity. If that's the case, then the fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as distrustful without cause. The question is whether expecting trust without proof is reasonable. \n\nI think the author's anger is justified if there's no reason to suspect infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's action might be seen as a lack of trust, making the author right to be upset. However, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has personal fears or past issues that aren't mentioned here. But based on the information given, the author isn't the one in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is the one initiating the request without grounds, so the author's reaction is valid. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
