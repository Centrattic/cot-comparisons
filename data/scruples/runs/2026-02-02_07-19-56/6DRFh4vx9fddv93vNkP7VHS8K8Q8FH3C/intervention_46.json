He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry at their fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: they're 4 months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the baby. The author is upset because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that many men trust their partners and end up not being the biological father. The author's brothers agree with the fianc\u00e9, saying that since the baby is coming from the author, they know it's theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't. The older brother says the author is asking for trust without being able to reciprocate it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear the assistant's opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nHmm. From an ethical standpoint, trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. The author is hurt because the request for a paternity test seems like a breach of trust. But the fianc\u00e9 is expressing a legitimate concern\u2014that even without suspicion, infidelity can happen. The author's brothers' points are that the author has certainty (since it's their body) but the fianc\u00e9 can't have that same certainty. So the author is asking for trust that the fianc\u00e9 can't fully give, perhaps.\n\nBut wait, in a healthy relationship, mutual trust is essential. If the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a paternity test without any concrete reason, that could indicate a lack of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is based on the idea that even without suspicion, people might end up in situations where the child isn't theirs. So maybe he's preemptively addressing his fears. On the other hand, the author feels disrespected and untrusted. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, then the request might be unnecessary and hurtful.\n\nLegally, the paternity test might be required if the father wants to establish legal paternity, but in this case, it's more about emotional trust. The author feels wronged because they're being trusted implicitly, while the author is expected to trust the fianc\u00e9 without the same assurance.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The author is reacting emotionally to a request that feels like a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 is trying to address his own insecurities. The author's brothers' arguments suggest that the author is not in the wrong because the request is based on the fianc\u00e9's inability to trust, not the author's actions. The author is not cheating, so expecting trust is reasonable. However, the author's anger might be seen as not understanding the fianc\u00e9's fear. But if there's no basis for the fear, the request seems unreasonable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
