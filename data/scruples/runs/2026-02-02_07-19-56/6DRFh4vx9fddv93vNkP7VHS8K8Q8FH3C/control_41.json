He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. So, the situation is that she's four months pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test when the baby is born. She's angry because she feels he's not trusting her. He argues that even though he has no reason to suspect her, some men have trusted their partners and ended up with kids not theirs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test seems based on fear of being cheated on, even though there's no evidence. He's justified in wanting to be sure the child is his, but the way he's approaching it might be an issue. The author is upset because she's being asked to trust him without question, even though she can be 100% certain about the child's parentage. Her brothers back her up, saying she's asking for trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nI think the key here is mutual trust in the relationship. If there's no indication of infidelity, his request could be seen as a lack of trust. The author isn't cheating, but his demand undermines the trust she expects. However, paternity tests can be a sensitive topic. Some people might see it as a reasonable precaution, especially if there's a history of betrayal in their family or if the fianc\u00e9 has anxiety about this. But in this case, there's no mentioned reason for suspicion, so his request might be unfounded.\n\nThe author's anger is a valid reaction to a perceived lack of trust. She's in a position where she can know the baby is hers biologically, but he can't without the test. Her brothers point out the imbalance in trust. So, expecting her fianc\u00e9 to trust her without the test isn't unreasonable if there's no basis for doubt. The fianc\u00e9's stance might be seen as unnecessary and causing unnecessary conflict. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling that her trust is being asked for without her being able to give the same assurance. The answer would be B, she's not the asshole.\n"
