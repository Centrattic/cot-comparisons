He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a pregnant fianc\u00e9e whose partner wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The author is angry because she feels this lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even though there's no reason to suspect cheating, he's heard of cases where men were deceived. The author's brothers support her, saying she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body, and that he can't have that certainty. The author is questioning whether she's the asshole for expecting trust, or if her partner is justified in wanting the test.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's accurate. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, being asked for a paternity test might feel like a breach of trust. Especially in a committed relationship, expecting trust is normal. The author might feel that her partner's request is based on fear or past stories, not current suspicions. She could argue that the test is unnecessary and undermines her fidelity.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's stance is that he can't know for sure unless tested. He might feel that even in the absence of evidence, the possibility exists, and he wants to avoid raising a child that isn't his. His reasoning is that trust is one-sided here\u2014he can't have the certainty she does. This is a common argument in such situations, where the person not directly involved in conception can't have the same level of certainty.\n\nNow, cultural and personal beliefs play a role. Some might say trust should be absolute in a committed relationship, while others believe that a paternity test is a reasonable precaution. The key here is that the author's expectation of trust is based on her own certainty, which her partner can't share. Her brothers' comments highlight this asymmetry in certainty.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, expecting trust is reasonable, but so is the partner wanting some form of assurance. However, the author's anger might stem from feeling untrusting. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the partner's request might be seen as unnecessary. But the partner isn't accusing her of cheating; he's just seeking reassurance. \n\nIn many cases, paternity tests are requested when there's a history of infidelity or other red flags. Here, there's no such history. The fianc\u00e9 is acting out of fear based on general stories, not specific suspicions. That could make his request seem overreaching. However, he's not wrong to have doubts if he can't have the same certainty as the author.\n\nBut the author's anger is also valid. Trust in a relationship is a two-way street. If one partner can't trust the other without evidence, it can cause significant strain. The author might feel that this request is a breach of trust and that she's being treated as untrustworthy without cause.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's not cheating and there's no reason to suspect it, her anger is justified. However, if she expects her partner to trust her without any evidence, that might be a bit one-sided. The partner can't have the same certainty she does, so his request isn't entirely unreasonable from his perspective. The conflict arises from differing expectations of trust and assurance.\n\nIn conclusion, while both have valid points, the author isn't in the wrong. Her expectation of trust is reasonable, and her partner's request, though based on his lack of certainty, might be seen as unnecessary without any specific reason to doubt. The author's reaction is about feeling disrespected and mistrusted, which is a legitimate concern. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
