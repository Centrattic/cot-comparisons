He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 counters by saying many men trust their partners and end up with kids that aren't theirs. The author's brothers support her, saying she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body, but he doesn't.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong for expecting trust, or is the fianc\u00e9 justified in wanting the paternity test? \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. Trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. If the author hasn't given any reason for the fianc\u00e9 to doubt her, then his request might seem unfounded. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't unreasonable in a general sense. He's worried about the possibility of someone else's child being raised as his. But the key here is that there's no indication the author has been unfaithful. The fianc\u00e9's fear seems to stem from hypothetical scenarios rather than concrete reasons.\n\nThe author left to cool down, which is a reasonable response to a heated argument. Her brothers support her, which adds weight to her perspective. The fianc\u00e9's argument that others have been betrayed without suspicion doesn't negate the fact that in this specific case, there's no evidence against her. Trust should be mutual, and if one person is asking for something that inherently breaks trust without cause, that's a problem.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have mutual trust. The fianc\u00e9's demand for a paternity test without any justification could be seen as a breach of trust, which is a significant issue. The author is right to feel hurt because trust is a two-way street. However, the fianc\u00e9's underlying fear might need to be addressed. Maybe he has past experiences or anxiety that's causing this. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she hasn't done anything to warrant the test, then expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on hypotheticals, not facts. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Her brothers' support also suggests that her perspective is valid. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that wanting a paternity test is reasonable as a precaution. But without any suspicion, it's more about the fianc\u00e9's personal anxiety. The author's right to feel disrespected is valid. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
