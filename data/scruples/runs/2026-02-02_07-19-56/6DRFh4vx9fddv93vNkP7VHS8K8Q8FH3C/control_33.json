He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA for being angry with fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test) is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child, which makes the author feel untrusting. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even though he has no reason to suspect cheating, others have been in similar situations. The author's brothers support her view, saying she knows the baby is his but he doesn't, and that she's asking for trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in relationships. The author is upset because the request for a paternity test implies a lack of trust. Trust is a fundamental part of any relationship, so feeling that trust is being broken can be valid. However, the fianc\u00e9's stance is that without the test, he can't be certain, which is a common concern for men in such situations. There's a conflict between the need for trust and the practical reality of biological certainty.\n\nThe brothers' perspective highlights that the author inherently knows the baby is the fianc\u00e9's, but he can't have the same certainty without the test. This creates an imbalance in mutual trust. The author expects him to trust her without evidence, while he wants assurance. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting that trust.\n\nLegally and socially, paternity is often established through marriage or other legal means, but personal doubts can still arise. The fianc\u00e9's request is about his personal peace of mind. However, the author feels disrespected and untrusted. Both sides have valid points, but the key is whether the author's expectation of trust is unreasonable given the context.\n\nIn many cases, trust requires both parties to have similar levels of assurance. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the request for a test might be seen as unnecessary and distrustful. However, the fianc\u00e9's argument that others have been deceived without prior suspicion adds another layer. It's a balance between personal anxiety and relational trust.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's justified in feeling hurt by the lack of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's request stems from his own need for certainty. The brothers' comments suggest that the author's expectation might not account for the asymmetry in knowledge (she knows, he doesn't). Therefore, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because expecting unilateral trust without addressing his legitimate concerns could be seen as not considering his perspective. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9's request is unwarranted, she's not in the wrong. But given the brothers' reasoning, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
