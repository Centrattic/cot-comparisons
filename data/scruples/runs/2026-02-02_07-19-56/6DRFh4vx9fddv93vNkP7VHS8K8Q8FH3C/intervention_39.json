He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 about wanting a paternity test. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's 4 months pregnant, and the fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test when the baby is born. She's upset because she feels it's a lack of trust. He argues that other men have been deceived even when they trusted their partners. They argued, she went to her parents, and her brothers said she's expecting trust from him that he can't give back. She's wondering if she's the asshole for expecting trust.\n\nSo, the key points here are about trust in a relationship. The author is upset because her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test, which she sees as distrust. He's concerned about the possibility of not being the biological father, even without any evidence of infidelity. \n\nTrust is a two-way street. If the author is certain of her fidelity and the baby's paternity, she might expect her fianc\u00e9 to trust her. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have his own reasons for wanting a test, possibly based on past experiences or fears. However, if there's no indication of cheating, then the request could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHer brothers' comments suggest that she can't expect him to trust her if he can't verify the baby's paternity. But in a healthy relationship, trust is foundational. If he's asking for a test without any reason, that might indicate he doesn't trust her, which would be an issue. The author's anger seems justified if there's no basis for suspicion. \n\nHowever, maybe the fianc\u00e9 has his own insecurities or past trauma that make him fear being deceived. But in that case, he might need to address his own insecurities rather than imposing a test. \n\nThe question is whether her expectation of trust is reasonable. If she's faithful and there's no reason to doubt, then she's not in the wrong for being upset. The fianc\u00e9's request might stem from his own issues, but that doesn't make her wrong for feeling disrespected. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She has a right to expect trust from her partner, especially without evidence of infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test without cause could be seen as a lack of trust, which is a problem in the relationship. The author's anger is a valid response to feeling untrusted."
