He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test. So, the situation is she's pregnant, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn child. She's upset because she feels he doesn't trust her. He argues that other people have been in the same situation, even without suspicion, and ended up with kids not theirs. Her brothers say she's being unreasonable, that she knows the baby is his because it's hers, but he can't know unless tested. She's asking if she's the asshole for expecting trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test might stem from insecurity or fear of being cheated on, even if there's no evidence. On the other hand, the author feels disrespected and untrusted, which is a valid emotional response. Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship, and demanding proof can erode that. However, the fianc\u00e9 might be acting out of caution based on his own fears or past experiences.\n\nThe author's anger is about feeling untrusted without cause. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the request could be seen as a breach of trust. The brothers' comments suggest that the author is expecting a level of trust that's not reciprocal, but maybe that's not fair. The fianc\u00e9 can't know the baby is his without a test, so from his perspective, it's a safeguard. But the author is hurt because the request implies distrust. \n\nIs her expectation of trust unreasonable? In relationships, mutual trust is essential. If there's no indication of cheating, the request for a paternity test might be unwarranted. However, the fianc\u00e9's fear is based on others' experiences, which he might relate to his own insecurities. The key here is whether the author's expectation of trust is valid when there's no evidence of infidelity. If the fianc\u00e9 is acting without any suspicion, it's possible he's overcompensating.\n\nBut the author's feelings are valid. If a partner can't trust her without evidence, that's a problem. Trust shouldn't require proof unless there's a legitimate reason. The fianc\u00e9's action might be self-serving; he gets to avoid potential doubt by testing, but it's a way to shift blame. The author is in a position where she can't be 100% sure about the paternity (even though she knows her own body), but he can't know unless tested. However, in most cases, unless there's a reason to doubt, such a request is seen as a lack of trust. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's anger is justified. She's being asked to undergo something that implies she's untrustworthy, and the fianc\u00e9's behavior is undermining the relationship's foundation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
