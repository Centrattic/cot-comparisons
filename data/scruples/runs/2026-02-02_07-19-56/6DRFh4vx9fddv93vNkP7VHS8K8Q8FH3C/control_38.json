He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is upset because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that even though there's no reason to suspect infidelity, many men have been tricked before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test, which might be driven by fear of being cheated on. On the other hand, the author feels disrespected and untrusted. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's heard stories of men raising kids who aren't theirs. But the author points out that there's no basis for suspicion here. The brothers' comments back that up, saying the author knows the baby is theirs, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't. The brother also mentions the trust issue is one-sided.\n\nTrust in a relationship is crucial. If there's no evidence of cheating, expecting a paternity test could be seen as distrustful. The author might feel that the request undermines the trust they should have in each other. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel anxious due to past experiences or fears.\n\nBut the key here is that the author is pregnant, and the baby is the result of their relationship. There's no indication of infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's request seems based on fear rather than evidence. The author expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's demand for a paternity test without cause might be seen as a breach of trust, making the author right to feel hurt.\n\nSo, considering that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The fianc\u00e9's actions are based on unfounded suspicion, which isn't justified. The author has a right to expect trust in the relationship, especially without any evidence of wrongdoing.\n"
