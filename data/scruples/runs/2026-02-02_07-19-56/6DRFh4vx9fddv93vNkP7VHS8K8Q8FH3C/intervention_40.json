He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn son, and the author is angry because it feels like a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have been deceived, and he doesn't have a way to know for sure unless tested. The author's brothers argue that since the baby is coming from her body, she knows it's his, but he can't be sure. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider trust in a relationship. Trust is fundamental, and asking for a paternity test might come off as distrustful. However, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't entirely baseless. If there's no prior indication of infidelity, it's unusual for someone to request a test. But if there's any history of cheating or if the pregnancy wasn't planned, that could be a factor. The author's argument is about mutual trust\u2014expecting her partner to trust her as she trusts him. The brothers' points suggest that the man can't have the same certainty she does, which is a valid perspective. \n\nHowever, the key here is the absence of any reason to suspect infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that \"lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs,\" which is a generalization. While it's true that some people have been deceived, it's not a common enough occurrence to justify a paternity test without specific reasons. The author's anger is a reaction to the implied distrust, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's request might be stemming from fear or past experiences, but without any concrete reasons, it's reasonable for the author to feel hurt and see it as a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that his request is a protective measure for the child's future, ensuring legal and emotional ties. But in a healthy relationship, trust is the foundation, and such a request could indicate underlying issues in the relationship. The author's brothers make a good point about the asymmetry in certainty, but the author's expectation of trust is also valid. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's request is based on a lack of trust without justification, which is unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
