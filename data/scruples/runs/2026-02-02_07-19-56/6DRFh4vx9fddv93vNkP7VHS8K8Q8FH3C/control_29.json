He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9e) is in the wrong for being angry with her fianc\u00e9 over wanting a paternity test for their unborn child.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test is based on his desire to know for sure that the child is his. He mentions that even though there's no suspicion of infidelity, he's heard of cases where men didn't realize they were raising another man's child. From his perspective, it's about ensuring certainty and not falling into a similar situation.\n\nThe author feels that this request is a lack of trust. She argues that she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her body, implying that his need for a test is unfounded. Her brothers support this view, pointing out that the author has absolute knowledge, while the fianc\u00e9 doesn't. The older brother's comment about reciprocated trust is also a key point here.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a two-way street. If there's no evidence of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's request might stem from insecurity rather than a justified suspicion. The author's anger is a reaction to feeling untrusted without cause. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be acting out of fear or past experiences, but his approach could be seen as undermining the trust that should be foundational in a committed relationship, especially in a situation like pregnancy where such a test isn't typically necessary unless there's a clear reason.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether expecting trust without reciprocal trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective is that she has no reason to be unfaithful, so expecting him to trust her is fair. The fianc\u00e9's stance is about his own peace of mind, but without any concrete issues, his demand for a test could be seen as eroding trust. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner can't trust the other without needing proof, that could indicate deeper issues. The author's anger is justified if there's no evidence of wrongdoing. Her brothers' advice highlights the asymmetry in their knowledge\u2014she knows the baby is his, he doesn't. His request is based on his uncertainty, which isn't something she can provide. \n\nSo, the fianc\u00e9's decision to request a paternity test without any basis might be the issue here. The author isn't wrong for expecting trust, especially in the absence of any reason to doubt her fidelity. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
