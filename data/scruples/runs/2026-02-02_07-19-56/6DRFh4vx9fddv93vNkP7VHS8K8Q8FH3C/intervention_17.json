He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which made the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust. The fianc\u00e9 argues that many men have been deceived and don't have reasons to suspect their partners. The author's brothers support her, saying she knows the baby is his because it's coming from her, but he doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and emotional aspects here. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and the fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test might stem from fear or past experiences. However, the author feels disrespected, which is valid. The fianc\u00e9's action could be seen as a breach of trust if there's no evidence of infidelity. \n\nBut wait, the fianc\u00e9 isn't accusing the author of cheating; he's just requesting a test out of precaution. Some might argue that it's his right to be certain, especially if he's worried about raising someone else's child. Others might say that such a request undermines the mutual trust needed in a marriage. \n\nThe author's brothers' perspective is that the author can be certain of the child's parentage because it's her body, but the fianc\u00e9 can't be unless tested. That's a logical point, but it's also a bit of a double standard. In relationships, both partners are expected to trust each other. If the fianc\u00e9 can't trust her without proof, it might indicate deeper issues.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable because the request feels like an accusation. However, the fianc\u00e9's fear isn't entirely irrational. It's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points. But in the context of a committed relationship, expecting trust is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's request could be a sign of insecurity or past trauma, but the author might feel it's unjustified without any suspicion of cheating.\n\nConsidering all angles, while the author isn't entirely wrong to feel hurt, expecting trust is standard in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's decision to demand a paternity test without any evidence might be overstepping, as it's placing an unrealistic burden on the author. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
