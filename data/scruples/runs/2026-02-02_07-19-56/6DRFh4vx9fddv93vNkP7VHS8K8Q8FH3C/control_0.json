He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about a fianc\u00e9 wanting a paternity test for their unborn child, which makes the author angry because they feel it's a lack of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test is driven by fear of being cheated on, even though there's no suspicion. He mentions others who trusted and ended up with kids not theirs. The author feels this is unjustified and a breach of trust. Her brothers' responses support her, emphasizing that the baby is hers biologically, but the fianc\u00e9 doesn't know for sure. The older brother's point about expecting trust from him that he can't reciprocate is interesting.\n\nNow, societal norms usually place the burden of proof on the man because the woman's pregnancy is a physical certainty for her, while he can't be sure without a test. So the fianc\u00e9's request, while hurtful, might stem from a place of wanting to avoid a potential scam. However, the author's feelings of being mistrusted are valid. Trust is a cornerstone of relationships. If there's no reason to suspect infidelity, the request could be seen as undermining that trust.\n\nBut in many cases, men do ask for paternity tests, especially in new relationships, as a precaution. It's a personal choice, but it's important to consider the emotional impact on the partner. The author's anger is a reaction to perceived betrayal of trust, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's justification is based on others' experiences, but that doesn't necessarily make it right in their specific situation. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9 has a legitimate reason. Since there's no indication of cheating, his request might be irrational, making the author's reaction justified. So the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B). However, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is also understandable from a societal standpoint. This is a tricky balance between trust and self-preservation. The answer hinges on whether the fianc\u00e9's request is without basis. If there's no suspicion, then his need for the test might be unreasonably damaging to the trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about the lack of trust.\n"
