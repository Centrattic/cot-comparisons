He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a pregnant fianc\u00e9e who's upset because her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn child. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that he's heard of other men being tricked into raising kids that aren't theirs. The author feels this is a lack of trust, while her brothers argue that the fianc\u00e9 is justified because he can't be sure without a test. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if I agree.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is trust in the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's request for a paternity test is based on his uncertainty and the fear of being deceived. The author is angry because she feels this is an accusation of infidelity without any evidence. The brothers' perspectives add another layer, suggesting that the fianc\u00e9 is being reasonable since he can't \"see\" the baby's paternity like the author can.\n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner is requesting a paternity test without any indication of infidelity, it can be seen as a breach of trust. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even without suspicion, the risk exists. The author might feel that her fianc\u00e9 isn't giving her the benefit of the doubt, which is a valid feeling in a committed relationship. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's concern isn't entirely baseless if he's heard stories where men were deceived, but that doesn't necessarily apply to their specific situation.\n\nThe ethical question here is whether the fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable given the lack of evidence, and whether the author is wrong for being upset. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship. If there's no history of infidelity or other red flags, the request for a paternity test could be seen as unnecessary and distrustful. However, if the fianc\u00e9 has genuine fears based on past experiences, his stance might be more understandable.\n\nThe brothers' argument that the author can \"see\" the baby is theirs, while the fianc\u00e9 can't, is an interesting point. It highlights the asymmetry in certainty. But in a healthy relationship, partners are supposed to trust each other without such concrete proof unless there's a compelling reason. The author's anger stems from feeling untrusted, which is a common reaction. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on a test might be seen as undermining the foundation of their relationship, which is built on mutual trust.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's response is a normal reaction to feeling untrusted. The fianc\u00e9's request, while motivated by fear, is not based on evidence and could be seen as a breach of trust. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here. The answer would lean towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
