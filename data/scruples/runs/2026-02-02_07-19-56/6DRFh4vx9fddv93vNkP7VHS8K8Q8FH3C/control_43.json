He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me? Is it reasonable for him to want this? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a pregnant woman, four months along, and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for their unborn son. She's angry because she feels he doesn't trust her, and her brothers back her up, saying she knows the baby is his since it came from her body. The fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that even though he doesn't have any reason to suspect her of cheating, others in similar situations have ended up raising kids that aren't theirs. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a two-way street, right? If the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a paternity test without any concrete reason, that does imply a lack of trust. The author is feeling wronged because she's being asked to prove something that, from her perspective, is obvious. Her brothers' comments add to the idea that she's the one who can know for sure, while he can't. \n\nBut then again, the fianc\u00e9's stance is that even if there's no suspicion, he wants to ensure the child is his. Maybe he's had past experiences or knows others who were cheated on. But is that a valid reason to distrust his partner without evidence? The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting trust. \n\nIn most relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner is asking for a paternity test without any reason, it can be seen as a breach of trust. The author isn't cheating, as per the situation, so his request is based on fear or past examples, not actual evidence. The author's anger is a natural reaction to being doubted. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's being cautious. But in a healthy relationship, partners are supposed to trust each other. If he can't trust her, that's a problem. The author isn't doing anything wrong by expecting that trust. Her brothers' point is valid\u2014she's the one who can know the child's parentage, so his request seems unfair. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 is the one lacking trust without cause. The answer should be B (No), meaning the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
