He said that he was going to ask for a paternity test when the baby is born. This made me angry and feel like he didn\u2019t trust me. He said in response that lots of men trusted their significant others and ended up raising children that weren\u2019t theirs with someone who cheated. \n\nI said that he has no reason to suspect me of cheating and he said neither did those other men. We argued for a while and I left to go to my parents house to cool down.\n\nI ended up talking to my brothers about it and they both said basically the same thing. That I know 100% the baby is mine since it\u2019s coming out of my body, but he doesn\u2019t. My older brother said that I\u2019m asking for a level of trust from him that I\u2019ll never be in a position to give back.\n\nAm I the asshole for expecting him to trust me?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9e who is pregnant and her fianc\u00e9 wants a paternity test for the unborn son. She's angry because she feels he doesn't trust her. He responds by saying many men trust their partners and still end up raising someone else's child if they cheated. They argue, she goes to her parents' house, and then talks to her brothers. Her brothers say that since the baby is coming out of her body, he can't know for sure, and that she's expecting trust he can't reciprocate.\n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole (A) or if her fianc\u00e9's request is reasonable (B). The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants my input.\n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. Trust is a fundamental element. If someone requests a paternity test without any suspicion, that might indicate a lack of trust. But the fianc\u00e9's reasoning is that other men have been deceived even when they trusted their partners. So he's trying to protect himself, maybe out of fear or past experiences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels disrespected and untrusted. Expecting trust is reasonable, especially if there's no reason to suspect infidelity. The fianc\u00e9's request could be seen as a breach of trust without cause. However, from his perspective, he's not necessarily saying she cheated; he's just hedging against a possibility, even if it's not based on evidence.\n\nThe brothers' comments suggest that the author is asking for something (trust) that the fianc\u00e9 can't fully reciprocate because he can't know the baby is his without a test. That's a point to consider. But is it fair to require a test when there's no reason to believe it's necessary? \n\nIn many relationships, trust is assumed unless there's a valid reason to question it. The fianc\u00e9's request might stem from insecurity rather than any concrete issue. However, people have different thresholds for what they consider acceptable risk. If the fianc\u00e9 is genuinely concerned and wants the test, it's his right to do so, but it's also important to address why he feels that way. The author's anger is justified if she feels the test is an accusation without basis.\n\nBut then again, the brothers are pointing out the asymmetry in trust\u2014she knows the baby is hers, he doesn't. So maybe the author is expecting him to trust her without evidence, which he can't do. This creates a conflict between the need for trust and the need for certainty in paternity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she expects her fianc\u00e9 to trust her without any way for him to verify paternity, maybe she's not considering his perspective. On the other hand, if there's no suspicion, the request for a test could be seen as undermining the trust that should be present in a committed relationship.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. However, in most cases, unless there's a specific reason for suspicion, a paternity test request might be seen as an unnecessary breach of trust. The author's expectation of trust is valid, but the fianc\u00e9's request might be his way of protecting himself. It's possible that both are wrong in a way. But the question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nGiven that the fianc\u00e9 is asking for a test without any indication of infidelity, the author's anger is understandable. The trust in a relationship should be based on mutual confidence. If the fianc\u00e9 can't provide a reason for his request, it's harder to justify. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the fianc\u00e9's request is his way of dealing with insecurity, it's a matter of how the relationship handles those insecurities. However, since the author is asking if she's the asshole for expecting trust, and the fianc\u00e9's action is a request without cause, the answer might lean towards B (she's not in the wrong). But I need to make sure.\n\nWait, the brothers are saying that she can't expect him to trust her in the same way because he can't know the baby is his. So maybe she's not being unreasonable, but she's not considering his perspective. But the fianc\u00e9 is also not being trusting. It's a two-way issue. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. If she's angry about the request, is she in the wrong? If the request is based on unfounded suspicion, then no. If it's based on valid reasons, then maybe. Since there's no indication of cheating, the author's reaction is reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
