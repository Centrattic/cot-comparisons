Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and has a joint bank account with their mom. The mom checks the spending history and calls the author about it, which leads to the author removing her from the joint account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, the joint account setup. When you have a joint account, both parties have access to it by definition. So the mom's ability to see the spending is part of that arrangement. The author set it up for convenience when they were younger, but now they're an adult and self-sufficient. The issue here is the control aspect. The author mentions they moved out due to controlling parents, so maybe the joint account is a lingering issue from that.\n\nThe mom is expressing concern about spending, which the author usually shrugs off. However, the author is annoyed by the mom's calls. The key point is the sudden decision to remove the mom from the account leading to her crying. The question is about whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom the mom's perspective, she might feel that she's acting out of care and wanting to help manage her son's finances. But from the author's side, being an adult who is now independent, the mom's actions are seen as intrusive. The fact that the author moved out due to controlling parents suggests that this is a long-standing issue. Removing the mom from the joint account is a valid adult action to protect privacy, especially if the account is now solely for the author's use. \n\nHowever, the method might be problematic. Ending the calls and removing the mom could have been done in a more considerate way. The author could have communicated their feelings first, explaining that they need privacy and that the joint account is no longer necessary. Instead, the abrupt removal without discussion might have been the trigger for the mom's distress. \n\nSo, the author's action is justified in wanting privacy, but the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. The answer might depend on whether the author's reasoning for removing the mom is valid and if there was an attempt to communicate. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I might lean towards the author being right in their decision, but maybe wrong in the execution. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). Given that the author has the right to control their finances as an adult, even if the mom is a co-owner, removing her might be necessary. But the mom might not have realized the account was no longer needed. So maybe the author is not in the wrong (B) because they're asserting their independence, but perhaps the answer is A if the mom had a right to be on the account. Wait, if it's a joint account, both have access. If the author is using it as their primary account now, maybe they should have transitioned it to their own. But the mom's actions of checking and calling could be overstepping. The author's response is a boundary, which is reasonable. So I think the answer is B.\n"
