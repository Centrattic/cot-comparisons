Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account.\n\nFirst, the joint account was set up when the author was younger, which made sense for convenience. Now the author is 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, which the author finds intrusive. The tipping point was when the mom called repeatedly about a car insurance payment, leading the author to remove her from the account, which upset the mom.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mom might see her actions as helpful, trying to look out for her adult child. But the author feels their privacy is invaded, especially since they're independent. The key here is that the author is an adult and has the right to manage their own finances. The mom's constant monitoring and calls could be overstepping, even if well-intentioned. The author's reaction, while causing emotional distress, is about asserting their autonomy. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're setting boundaries as an adult. However, the situation shows a lack of communication. The mom might not realize that the joint account isn't needed anymore. The author could have discussed removing her from the account first instead of doing it suddenly. But the main issue is the mom's behavior being intrusive. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
