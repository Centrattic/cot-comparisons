Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for making their mom cry after taking her off a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the user and their mom. The user is now 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and calls the user about it, which the user finds intrusive.\n\nSo, the user set up a joint account with their mom for convenience, maybe when they were younger. Now that they're adults and living independently, the mom's checking the spending history makes them upset. The user feels their privacy is invaded, especially when the mom calls repeatedly about things the user already knows about. The user decides to remove the mom from the account, leading to the mom crying.\n\nI need to determine if the user is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Joint accounts typically mean both parties have access to the funds and transactions. However, the user might feel that their financial privacy is being respected once they're an adult. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the user is no longer a minor and is handling their own finances. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have legitimate concerns, especially if the account was set up with the understanding that she would help monitor or manage it. If the user didn't communicate their discomfort with the joint account earlier, maybe the mom thought it was still necessary. The user's anger and sudden removal might have been abrupt, causing emotional distress.\n\nBut considering the user is 25 and self-sufficient, they might have the right to financial independence. The mom's snooping could be seen as a lack of trust, which the user is justified in addressing. The user's action to remove the mom from the account is about reclaiming control, which isn't inherently wrong. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing the issue before cutting off access to avoid hurt feelings.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the user's actions led to their mom crying, but if the underlying issue was the mom's overstepping, the user isn't necessarily wrong for setting a boundary. It's a matter of balancing parental concern with adult independence. The user might have handled it more diplomatically, but the core issue is about privacy and autonomy. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
