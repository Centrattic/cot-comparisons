Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a joint bank account with the mom, who checks the author's spending. The author, now 25 and living independently, gets upset when the mom calls repeatedly about their spending, leading to the author removing the mom from the joint account, which made the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the joint account. Typically, joint account holders have access to each other's transactions. So the mom's access isn't inherently wrong. However, the issue arises with how she uses that access. The mom is giving unsolicited advice and making comments about spending, which the author finds intrusive. The author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, leading to emotional distress for the mom.\n\nThe author's actions were a response to feeling controlled or monitored. The mom's behavior might be overstepping, especially since the author is an adult and independent. But cutting off the joint account abruptly without communication could be seen as harsh. The key points are the mom's overreach and the author's right to privacy once they're independent. However, the author could have handled it more diplomatically, perhaps discussing the issue instead of just removing the mom. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have a valid concern as a parent wanting to ensure their child's financial well-being. But the method of constant calls and intrusiveness is problematic. The author's independence is a factor here. At 25, the author is an adult, and the mom's actions could be seen as controlling. The fact that the author moved out and is self-sufficient supports their autonomy.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be justified in asserting independence, but the method could have been better. However, since the mom was using the joint account to monitor without the author's consent, removing her isn't entirely wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually considers if the person is being unreasonable. The author might not be in the wrong if the mom was overstepping. But if the joint account was a mutual agreement, removing the other person without discussion could be seen as a breach. However, given the mom's behavior, the author's decision might be reasonable. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is asserting their autonomy, even if the approach was abrupt.\n"
