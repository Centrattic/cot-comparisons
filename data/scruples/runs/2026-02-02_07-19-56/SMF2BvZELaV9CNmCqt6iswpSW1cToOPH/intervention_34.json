Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a joint bank account with the mother, and the person is ending the joint account because their mom checks their spending, which led to an argument and the mom crying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person was in a joint account with their mom for a long time, which was helpful when they were younger. Now they're 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending and comments on it, which the person finds intrusive. When the mom called multiple times about a duplicate car insurance charge, the person got angry, ended the joint account, and the mom cried.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mom might be overstepping by monitoring the adult child's spending without consent. The person is now independent, so privacy could be a right. On the other hand, the mom might be genuinely concerned, and the abrupt action of removing her from the account might be seen as hurtful. Also, the person had time to address the issue calmly but reacted angrily, leading to emotional distress. \n\nLegally, joint accounts mean both have access, so removing the mom might be their right. Emotionally, the mom's concern might be valid if she's worried about her child's financial health. However, the line between concern and overstepping can be blurry. The person's reaction (anger and sudden removal) might be seen as harsh, especially considering the mom's emotional state. But if the mom's behavior was consistently intrusive, the person has a right to set boundaries. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The person is now independent and has a right to privacy. 2) The mom's actions might be overstepping, especially if it's frequent and without consent. 3) The way the person ended the account was abrupt and caused emotional harm. \n\nSo, the person is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting privacy, but their method of handling it might have been harsh. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong at all. If the mom has a right to be on the account, the person might be in the wrong for removing her. But if the mom's monitoring is invasive and the person is an adult, maybe they are justified. It's a bit of a toss-up. I might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the person is asserting their independence and the mom's actions were intruding. However, the emotional impact could argue for A. Hmm.\n"
