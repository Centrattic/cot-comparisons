Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a joint bank account between a 25-year-old and their mom. The person is living independently now, which is a big step, and they've been self-sufficient since moving out. The mom checks their spending history and comments on it, sometimes calling multiple times to question expenses. The author then decides to remove the mom from the joint account because they're upset about the intrusion, which made the mom cry. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. Typically, joint account holders have access to each other's transactions. So the mom has a right to see the spending, but that doesn't necessarily mean the communication is appropriate. The author feels that the mom is overstepping, especially since they've been independent for a while. The mom's actions might be coming from a place of concern, but the way she's enforcing it\u2014multiple calls and prying into expenses\u2014could be seen as intrusive.\n\nThe author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which is understandable if they feel their privacy is being invaded. At 25, being self-sufficient usually means managing one's own finances. If the original joint account was set up when the person was younger, maybe it's time to transition to an individual account. However, the sudden removal and the resulting emotional reaction from the mom might indicate that the author didn't communicate this transition properly. Ending a joint account can have financial implications, like splitting balances or debts, so maybe there's a need for a more considerate approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions might be overbearing. If she's constantly monitoring and questioning the spending, it could be a form of control, especially if the author already has the capacity to manage their own money. The author's frustration is valid, and taking the mom off the account could be a necessary step for setting boundaries. However, the method of doing so (without prior discussion) might have contributed to the mom's emotional distress.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries, communication, and the appropriateness of the joint account given the person's independence. The author might not be in the wrong if the joint account was no longer needed, but the abrupt action could have been handled better. Alternatively, the mom's behavior might be overstepping, making the author justified in their decision. It's a bit of a gray area, but considering the adult child's independence and the mom's intrusiveness, the author's actions might be reasonable. However, the emotional response from the mom could have been mitigated with better communication.\n"
