Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a joint bank account between the person (25, moved out) and their mom. The mom checks the spending history, comments on it, and the person gets angry, removes the mom from the account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, joint accounts usually mean both parties have access and rights to the funds. So, by having a joint account, the person might have implicitly agreed that their mom can see the transactions. The mom's actions might be overstepping if they're intrusive, but the account's nature allows that.\n\nThe person moved out at 21 and is now self-sufficient, which suggests they want independence. However, the issue here is the mom's constant checking and commenting. The person reacted angrily and removed the mom from the account. That action could be seen as cutting off something they both shared without discussion. \n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, the mom's behavior might be controlling, but the joint account setup gives her that access. The person could have addressed the issue calmly instead of abruptly removing the mom, which caused emotional harm. So, maybe the person is partly at fault for not handling the situation better. Alternatively, the mom's snooping is overbearing, so the person has a right to stop it. \n\nBut since the account is joint, removing the mom might have been a hasty move without communication. The person might have valid reasons for wanting privacy, but the method used could be seen as harsh. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) for not handling the conflict maturely, even if the mom's actions were problematic.\n"
