Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a joint bank account with the mother, and the author is upset that the mother checks their spending and calls them about it. The author ended the joint account, making the mom cry. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mother's perspective: she's in a joint account, which typically allows both parties access. She might feel she's being responsible by monitoring the account, especially since they were in a joint account since the author was young. Her concern could stem from wanting to protect or help manage finances, maybe out of habit or worry.\n\nThe author's side: they're 25, moved out, and established independence. The mother's constant checking and calling about expenses might feel intrusive and controlling, especially if the author is managing their own money now. The anger leading to ending the joint account and making the mom cry is the crux here.\n\nNow, joint accounts usually mean both have access. If the author didn't want the mom to see transactions, maybe they should have had that conversation earlier. However, the mom might not realize the intrusion, especially if it's a habit from when the author was younger. The author's reaction (getting angry and removing the mom) could be seen as a valid stand for personal boundaries, especially if they've been self-sufficient for years.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The mom's actions might be overstepping if the author is an adult and independent. The author has the right to manage their finances without interference. However, the abrupt action without communication might have contributed to the mom's emotional reaction.\n\nI think the key points are the nature of joint accounts and the author's right to privacy as an adult. If the mom was part of a joint account without the author's consent or without mutual agreement on boundaries, then the author's decision to end it isn't wrong. However, if the joint account was mutual understanding, then removing the mom suddenly could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the context that the author has been self-sufficient and the mom's behavior felt controlling, the author might be justified in setting boundaries. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong).\n"
