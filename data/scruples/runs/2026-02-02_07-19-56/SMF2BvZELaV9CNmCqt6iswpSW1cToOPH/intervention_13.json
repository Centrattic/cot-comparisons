Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom. Since the author moved out and is now 25, they've become self-sufficient but have a joint account with their mom. The mom frequently checks their spending and calls to comment on it, which the author finds intrusive. The climax was the mom calling multiple times about a car insurance issue, leading the author to cut her off from the account, causing the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The joint account was set up when the author was younger, which might have been for convenience. Now that the author is an adult and living independently, the joint account could be a source of tension. The mom's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author is capable of managing their own finances. However, the mom's intention might be to help or protect, even if it's not appreciated.\n\nThe key points are: the author is 25, self-sufficient, and living on their own. The mom's interference in their financial decisions, including frequent calls and questioning, could be perceived as controlling. The author's decision to remove the mom from the account is their way of asserting independence. But the mom's emotional reaction (crying) suggests that ending the joint account was a significant blow to her, possibly because she felt it was a rejection of her care or a loss of connection.\n\nLegally, in a joint account, both parties have equal access, so the author can legally remove the mother. Ethically, it's about whether the author's actions were justified. If the mom's behavior was overbearing, the author has a right to set boundaries. However, the method of cutting off the account suddenly might have been harsh, leading to emotional distress. The author could have communicated better, maybe having a conversation about the need for independence without causing immediate emotional harm.\n\nThe author's anger at the mom's calls is understandable if the mom is being intrusive. But the decision to remove the mom from the account without prior discussion led to hurt feelings. So, the author's action was a boundary-setting one, but the manner in which it was done might have been abrupt. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on intent and communication. If the mom's actions were indeed overstepping, the author's decision is justified. However, if the author could have handled it more diplomatically, maybe the outcome would have been different. The mom's emotional reaction indicates that the author's action had a significant impact, which might make the author partially responsible for not considering the mom's feelings before acting.\n"
