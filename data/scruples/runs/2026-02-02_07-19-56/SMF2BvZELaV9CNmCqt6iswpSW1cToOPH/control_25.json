Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong (AITA) for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a joint account with their mom since they were younger. Now that they're 25 and living independently, they find it annoying that their mom checks their spending and calls them about it. The mom's actions seem to be out of concern, but the author feels it's intrusive. The breaking point was when the mom called multiple times about a car insurance payment, leading the author to remove her from the account, which made the mom cry.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, they have a right to their financial privacy, especially since they're an adult. The joint account was set up when they were younger, maybe for convenience, but now that they're independent, the mom's continued access and monitoring without consent might be crossing a boundary. The author's decision to remove the mom from the account could be seen as asserting their independence. However, the mom might feel hurt because she's acting out of concern. \n\nBut the key here is consent and mutual agreement. If the joint account was originally set up with the understanding that it would be a shared responsibility, the author might have a point in wanting to change it now. The mom's actions, while well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping. The author's anger and the resulting hurt feelings are on both sides. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to manage their finances without constant oversight. However, the way they handled it (removing the mom suddenly without discussion) might have contributed to the emotional response. But overall, the situation is more about the mom's lack of respecting the author's independence than the author being wrong.\n"
