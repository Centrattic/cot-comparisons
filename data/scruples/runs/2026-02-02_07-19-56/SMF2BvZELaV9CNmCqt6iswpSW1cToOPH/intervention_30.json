Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the person is 25, moved out at 21, and has a joint bank account with their mom. The mom checks their spending history and comments on it. The person gets annoyed because their mom calls them about it, like with the car insurance payments. They got angry, told the mom to be removed from the account, and she cried. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, joint accounts usually mean both parties have access. The mom has a right to see the account activity since it's joint. But the person is an adult and moved out, so they might feel their privacy is being invaded. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's controlling. However, removing the mom from the joint account might be a valid decision for the person to regain control over their finances.\n\nBut the key points are the mom's behavior. If she's using the joint account to monitor and criticize the person's spending, that's an issue. The person might feel that their independence is being undermined. However, the author's reaction was to cut off the mom, leading to her crying. Is that fair? Well, the person has the right to manage the account as they see fit. But maybe there was a better way to handle it without causing emotional harm. Still, the mom's actions might be the root cause here. The author might not be in the wrong because they're asserting their autonomy, even if it hurt their mom's feelings. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, considering the context of controlling parents, the author's actions could be justified. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
