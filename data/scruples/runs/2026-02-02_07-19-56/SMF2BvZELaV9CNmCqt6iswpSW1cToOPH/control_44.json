Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom, which started when the author was younger. Now that the author is 25, living independently, and the mom is checking their spending history, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint bank account. Typically, both parties have access to the account, so the mom seeing the transactions isn't inherently wrong. However, the issue here is the mom's behavior\u2014calling multiple times based on what she sees, which the author finds intrusive.\n\nThe author moved out at 21, indicating they want independence. The mom's actions, like commenting on spending and calling about specific charges, might be seen as overstepping. The author's response was to remove the mom from the account, which caused the mom to cry. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the context.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they feel their autonomy is being invaded. At 25, they're an adult and might view their mom's monitoring as controlling. The mom's behavior could be well-meaning but crosses into being overbearing. The author's frustration leading to removing the mom might be seen as a reasonable step to regain control over their finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel concerned and involved because she's used to managing her child's account. Removing her access suddenly without discussion could hurt her feelings. However, the author's decision to set a boundary here is about asserting independence. The mom's crying could stem from feeling rejected or worried about her child's financial habits.\n\nI need to balance the intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the intrusion, which is a valid need for autonomy. The method might have been abrupt, but given the history of controlling behavior from parents, it's understandable. The mom's actions were overstepping, so the author's response isn't unjustified. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
