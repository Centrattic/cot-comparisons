Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and calls the author about expenses, leading to the author ending the joint account and the mom crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. A joint account typically means both parties have access and control. If the mom is a joint account holder, she has the right to view the transactions. So legally, she's not doing anything wrong by checking the spending. The author might feel it's an invasion of privacy, but legally, it's allowed.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The author feels that the mom is overstepping, especially since they are independent now. The mom's actions might be coming from a place of concern, but it's affecting the author's autonomy. The author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which ends the joint access. Was that a reasonable step? If the account was meant to be a support system when the author was younger, but now it's causing conflict, maybe the author has a valid point in wanting to end the joint arrangement.\n\nHowever, the mom's emotional response (crying) and the author's anger suggest that communication could have been handled better. The author might have considered discussing the issue calmly instead of abruptly cutting off the joint account. But considering the mom's repeated calls during work, which the author found intrusive, the frustration is understandable.\n\nThe key factors are the legality of the joint account access, the author's right to financial privacy, and the mother's concern. The author is self-sufficient and moving out was a step towards independence. The joint account might have been a tool for support in the past, but now it's causing conflict. The author's decision to end the joint account could be seen as necessary for maintaining their independence, even though the method was abrupt.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to control their finances now that they're independent. The mom's actions, while well-meaning, might have been overstepping, and the author taking action to set boundaries is justified. However, the way it was handled (anger and abruptness) could be questioned. But in terms of being in the wrong, the answer is likely B.\n"
