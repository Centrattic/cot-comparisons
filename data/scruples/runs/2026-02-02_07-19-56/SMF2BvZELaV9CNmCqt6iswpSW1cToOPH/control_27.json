Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history, which the author finds intrusive. The mom calls repeatedly about a car insurance charge, leading the author to remove her from the account, making the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider joint accounts. Typically, in a joint account, both parties have access to the funds and can see the transactions. So the mom's ability to check the spending isn't inherently wrong because that's how joint accounts work. But the author feels it's an invasion of privacy now that they're independent.\n\nThe author mentions they were in a joint account since they had a bank account, which was helpful when they were younger. Now, as an adult, they might feel this arrangement is no longer necessary. The mom's comments about spending could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is managing their own finances. The fact that the author had to move out due to controlling parents adds context\u2014maybe the mom hasn't adjusted to the author's independence.\n\nThe main issue is the privacy aspect. The author is upset about the mom snooping and calling during work. Ending the joint account is a way to set a boundary. However, the mom's actions might come from a place of concern, even if it's overbearing. The emotional response (crying) suggests the mom felt rejected or hurt.\n\nLegally, joint account holders can see each other's transactions, so the mom isn't doing anything wrong there. The conflict is more about the relationship and boundaries. The author might be justified in wanting to end the joint account to have financial privacy, especially after establishing independence. However, ending it abruptly might have been hurtful. Maybe a more open conversation could have been better, but the author's actions are a response to ongoing stress.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to financial privacy as an adult, and setting this boundary is reasonable. The mom's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, were intrusive. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
