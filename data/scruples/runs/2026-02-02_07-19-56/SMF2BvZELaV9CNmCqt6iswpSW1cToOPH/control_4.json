Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a joint bank account between the author and their mother. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and now feels that their mom is overstepping by checking their spending history and calling them multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. In a joint account, both parties typically have access to the account and can see transactions. So the mom's ability to check the spending history might not be inherently wrong from a legal standpoint. However, the emotional aspect is key here. The author feels that the mom is being controlling, especially given the context of moving out due to controlling parents. The mom's actions might be well-intentioned (looking out for the child), but the way she's doing it is causing conflict.\n\nThe author got angry and decided to remove the mom from the account, leading the mom to cry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were a response to what they perceive as intrusion and control. However, removing someone from a joint account can be a significant decision, and the mom might feel hurt or rejected, especially if she's used to being involved in the child's finances.\n\nFactors to consider: The mom's intentions (she's trying to help but might not be respecting the child's autonomy), the author's right to privacy and independence after moving out, and whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The author is now 25 and self-sufficient, so they might have a valid need for privacy. However, the sudden removal without addressing the issue calmly could be seen as harsh, especially if the mom didn't understand the reasoning. The crying suggests emotional harm.\n\nOn one hand, the author has the right to manage their finances without being monitored. On the other, the mom might have been acting out of concern. The author's anger and abrupt action might be justified in seeking independence, but the method could have been handled better. However, the core issue is whether the author was in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations and family dynamics, but legally, a joint account allows access. The author's action to remove the mom is their right, but the emotional response from the mom is a consequence. The author might not be in the wrong for asserting their independence, but their approach could have been more considerate. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), as the author is standing up for their autonomy, though the handling could be improved.\n"
