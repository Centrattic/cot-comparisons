Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mother. The author, now 25 and living independently since 21, has been self-sufficient. The mother checks the spending history and criticizes the author's spending, leading to the author ending the joint account and causing the mother to cry.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically allow both parties to access and monitor each other's transactions. The mother's actions are within her rights since it's a shared account. However, the author feels that the mother's constant monitoring and criticism are intrusive. The author's decision to remove the mother from the account was a reaction to this perceived intrusion.\n\nNow, considering the mother's perspective, she might view the joint account as a way to support and protect her child, especially if they were used to managing finances together. Her checking the account is a right as a joint account holder. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a violation of privacy and autonomy, which is understandable as an adult becoming self-sufficient.\n\nThe key points here are the rights and expectations associated with joint accounts. If the author wanted more privacy, they should have moved the account to their name alone earlier. Ending the joint account abruptly might have been a valid choice for the author's independence, but it led to emotional distress for the mother. However, the author's actions were to reclaim their financial independence, which is a legitimate need as they transition into adulthood.\n\nIn terms of fault, the mother's behavior could be seen as overstepping if she's making unsolicited criticisms, but she's acting within her rights as a joint holder. The author, while justified in seeking independence, might have handled the situation differently to avoid hurting their mother's feelings. However, the decision to end the account isn't inherently wrong if it's necessary for the author's autonomy.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to their own financial privacy and autonomy. The mother's actions, while well-intentioned, might not respect the author's adulthood. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
