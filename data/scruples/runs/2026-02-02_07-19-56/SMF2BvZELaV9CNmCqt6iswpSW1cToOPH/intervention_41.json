Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for making their mom cry by removing her from the joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between a 25-year-old adult and their mother. The mom checks the spending history and calls the author about their expenses, leading to the author cutting her off and causing distress.\n\nFirst, the age and independence of the author are key factors. At 25, the author is an adult and has been living separately for several years. The joint account was initially set up for convenience when the author was younger, but now it's causing conflict. The mom's actions, while possibly coming from a place of concern, involve checking the spending history and making unilateral judgments, which can feel invasive to the author.\n\nThe author's reaction is to remove the mom from the account, which leads to the mom crying. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mom might have thought she was helping by monitoring finances, but the author sees it as prying. Since the author is an adult and self-sufficient, they have the right to manage their own finances. The mom's continued interference, even after the author has moved out and is independent, might not be appropriate. The author's decision to end the joint account could be seen as a necessary step to establish financial independence, even if it hurt the mom's feelings. However, the author could have handled it more compassionately instead of abruptly removing the mom, which caused emotional harm. But considering the context, the author is within their rights to take control of their finances. So, the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
