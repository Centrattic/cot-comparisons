Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out, and is self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, sometimes pointing out possible extra charges. The author got angry when the mom called multiple times about two car insurance payments, leading to the author ending the joint account, which made the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, in a joint account, both parties typically have access to the account details. So the mom isn't doing anything wrong by checking the transactions. The author might feel their privacy is invaded, but technically, the mom has the right to see the transactions as a joint account holder. However, the emotional side is about how the mom's actions made the author feel. The author was controlling their finances independently but felt the mom was overstepping. The mom's concern could be seen as well-intentioned, but the frequency and manner of her calls might be overbearing. The author ended the account, which is their right, but it hurt the mom emotionally. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author acted within their legal rights (closing the account) but caused emotional harm, it's a gray area. The author might feel justified in protecting their privacy, but the mom's actions were within legal bounds too. However, the author's response (angrily ending the account leading to tears) could be seen as a harsh reaction. But considering the author's previous issues with controlling parents, maybe the mom's actions were part of that control. However, the mom is now acting as a concerned parent, not necessarily controlling. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether the author's actions were justified despite the emotional impact. If the mom was overstepping, the author is right. If the mom was just being a concerned parent, the author's reaction was too harsh. The key is whether the mom had a right to access the account and if the author's response was proportionate. Since joint account access is standard, the author's anger might be the issue here. So, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they overreacted, but the mom's behavior was also problematic. But the question is if the author is at fault. Given the options, the answer is A or B. I'm leaning towards B because the author is protecting their autonomy, and the mom's actions, while well-meaning, might have been intrusive. But the mom has the right to check the account. Hmm, conflicting views. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their privacy, so B. But if the mom had a right to check, maybe the author is in the wrong for cutting her off abruptly. It's a tough call. I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because they were asserting their independence, especially after moving out and being self-sufficient. The mom's concern was valid, but the author's privacy and autonomy are important.\n"
