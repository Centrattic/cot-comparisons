Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person has a joint bank account with their mom. They moved out at 21, are now 25, and have been self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending history and calls them about it, which leads to the author getting angry and removing their mom from the account, making the mom cry. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, joint bank accounts typically mean both parties have access to the account. So the mom having access isn't unreasonable on a technical level. However, the author feels that the mom is overstepping by monitoring their spending and calling them about it. The author moved out because of controlling parents, so this might be part of a larger issue of wanting independence.\n\nThe mom's actions could be seen as well-meaning but intrusive. She's concerned about her child's financial habits, which might stem from wanting to help. But the author is an adult and self-sufficient, so the mom's constant monitoring and calls might be crossing into invasion of privacy territory. The author's frustration is understandable if they value their independence and privacy.\n\nWhen the author decided to remove the mom from the joint account, it was a direct response to feeling snoopied. The mom being upset makes sense because she might feel rejected or worried about losing her role in helping. But from the author's perspective, the action was necessary to set boundaries.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the mom had the legal right to be on the joint account, the author removing her could be seen as a valid boundary-setting, especially if the mom's actions were causing stress. However, the author could have handled it more gently, perhaps by explaining their need for privacy without cutting off the mom abruptly. But the core issue is about autonomy versus parental concern. Since the author is an adult, they have the right to manage their own finances as they see fit. The mom's actions, while well-intentioned, may not respect the author's independence. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting that boundary, even if it caused emotional distress.\n"
