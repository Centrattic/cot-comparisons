Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account that the author had with their mom since they were younger. The author is now 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, which the author finds intrusive. The mom called multiple times about a car insurance payment, leading the author to remove the mom from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, a joint account allows both parties to access and monitor the account. So the mom's right to check the spending history is valid. However, the author feels that this is an invasion of privacy, especially since they are now independent. The mom's actions might be\u51fa\u4e8e concern, but the way she handles it\u2014calling repeatedly during work\u2014could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe author's reaction is to remove the mom from the account, which is their right since they can manage the account as they wish. However, the mom's emotional response suggests that this action hurt her feelings, possibly because she felt she was trying to help. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified given the context of their independence versus the mom's over-involvement.\n\nThe mom's behavior of constant monitoring and unsolicited advice might have contributed to the author's frustration. The author moving out and being self-sufficient indicates a desire for autonomy. The mom's calls during work hours about minor financial issues could be seen as controlling, which the author has previously fled from due to controlling parents.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might have some role. The mom's actions were within her rights but perhaps not considerate of the author's need for independence. The author's decision to remove the mom from the account is a valid step to regain control, but the way they communicated it might have been abrupt, leading to hurt feelings. However, the main issue is the mom's ongoing intrusion into the author's personal finances after they've become independent. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for asserting their independence, even if it upset the mom.\n"
