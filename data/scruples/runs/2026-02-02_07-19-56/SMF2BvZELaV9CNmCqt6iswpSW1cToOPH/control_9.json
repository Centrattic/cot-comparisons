Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry by removing her from the joint bank account. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The person is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. The joint account with their mom has been a source of tension. The mom checks their spending, gives unsolicited advice, and calls about minor expenses. The author felt annoyed and decided to cut off the mom from the account, leading to the mom crying.\n\nNow, the key points. The joint account means both have access, so the mom's actions aren't illegal. However, the author might feel their privacy is invaded. The mom is overstepping by constantly checking and calling about expenses. The author's response was to remove the mom from the account, which is their right since it's joint. But the mom cried, which adds emotional weight.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mom's actions were intrusive and controlling. The author had the right to protect their privacy and financial independence. Removing a joint account holder is a legal right, so the author isn't at fault. The mom's emotional reaction is unfortunate but doesn't make the author wrong. The author was justified in setting boundaries after years of self-sufficiency. So the answer is B.\n"
