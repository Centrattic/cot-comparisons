Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom. The user is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, which the author finds intrusive. The mom calls multiple times about an expense, leading the author to remove her from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of joint bank accounts. Typically, joint account holders have access to each other's transactions. So, the mom's ability to see the spending might be a legitimate right. However, the author feels it's an invasion of privacy. The key points here are the transition from a dependent child to an independent adult and the boundaries of the joint account.\n\nThe author moved out and is self-sufficient, which suggests they should have financial independence. However, the joint account setup might be the root cause. If the account was set up when the author was a minor or dependent, it's understandable for the mom to monitor spending. But now that the author is an adult, continuing this arrangement without mutual agreement might be problematic.\n\nThe mom's actions, while well-intentioned, could be seen as overstepping if the author no longer wants her involvement. The author's frustration is valid because their financial decisions are their own. Removing the mom from the account is a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The mom's emotional reaction indicates that the situation might have been a source of stress for her, possibly fearing the loss of control or concern for her child's financial stability.\n\nHowever, the author's approach was abrupt and caused emotional distress. Instead of removing her from the account, communicating the need for independence and explaining the decision might have been a better approach. But given the repeated intrusions and the author's clear need for autonomy, the action taken might be justified. The question is whether the author was wrong in removing the mom, considering the context of the joint account and the mom's behavior.\n\nIn similar situations, legal and financial advisors often suggest that joint accounts require mutual consent and understanding. If the account was initially set up for the author's benefit while underage, it's reasonable for the author to adjust the arrangement as they become independent. The mom's continued monitoring without the author's consent crosses a boundary. The author's decision to end the joint account is a way to reclaim financial privacy, which is a valid right as an adult. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking to end the joint account, though the method could have been handled more sensitively.\n"
