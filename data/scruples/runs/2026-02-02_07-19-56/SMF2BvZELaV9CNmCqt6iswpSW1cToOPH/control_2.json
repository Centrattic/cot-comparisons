Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. They've had a joint bank account with their mom since they had a bank account, which was helpful when they were younger. Now, the mom checks their spending and comments on it, like if they're spending too much or not saving enough. The author usually shrugs it off but sometimes gets annoyed when the mom points out specific charges. Today, the mom called five times while the author was working about two car insurance payments. The author got angry, told their mom they were removing her from the joint account, and the mom cried and hung up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The joint account was initially set up when the author was younger, for convenience. Now the author is an adult and independent. The mom is still part of the account, which gives her access to the spending history. The author feels that this invasion of privacy is too much, especially since they are in a different state and have been self-sufficient for a while. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is an adult. However, the mom might feel she's looking out for her child's financial well-being.\n\nThe key points here are privacy and autonomy. The author is an adult, and having a parent monitor their spending without their consent might be considered a breach of privacy. The fact that the author was called multiple times at work about this suggests the mom's concern is persistent and perhaps not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's decision to remove the mom from the account is a way to set a boundary, which is a reasonable step if they feel their autonomy is being violated.\n\nHowever, the mom crying indicates that the author's actions hurt her feelings. The question is whether the author had the right to remove the mom from the account. Since the account is joint, both parties can remove the other, so legally, the author is within their rights. The emotional impact is significant, but the author's actions are a response to ongoing privacy concerns.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are asserting their independence and right to privacy. The mom's behavior was overbearing, and the author took a step to correct that. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
