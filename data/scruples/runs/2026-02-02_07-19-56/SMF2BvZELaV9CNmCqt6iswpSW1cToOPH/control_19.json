Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a joint bank account between the author and their mother.\n\nFirst, the author is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. The joint account was set up when they were younger, but now the mother is checking the spending history and calling about expenses. The author feels it's intrusive and ends up removing their mom from the account, which makes the mom cry.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The joint account might be a point of conflict. When you have a joint account, both parties can access and monitor the funds. However, the author is now an adult and self-sufficient, so the mother's continued monitoring might be seen as overstepping, especially since the author has moved out and is managing their own life. \n\nThe mother's actions could stem from concern, but the author clearly feels it's a privacy issue. The fact that the mother called five times during work adds to the frustration. The author's response of removing the mother from the account might seem harsh, but if the account was set up when the author was younger and now they're independent, it's reasonable for the author to want control over their finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel that as a parent, she has a right to check in, especially if she's contributing to the account. However, if the author is no longer dependent, that right might not hold. The key here is the transition from dependent to independent adult. The author has been self-sufficient for four years, so the mother's continued oversight is likely unwarranted. \n\nThe emotional reaction (mother crying) might make it seem like the author is at fault, but the underlying issue is about boundaries. The author had the right to set boundaries, even if it hurt the mother's feelings. The mother should have respected the author's independence. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is asserting their autonomy after years of independence.\n"
