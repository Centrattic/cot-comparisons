Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a joint bank account with their mom, and the author decided to remove her from the account after getting upset over her checking their spending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. In a joint account, both parties typically have access to the funds and transaction history. So, the mom's ability to see the spending is normal. However, the author feels that the mom's constant checking and calling is intrusive, especially since they're now adults and independent.\n\nThe author moved out at 21, which suggests they wanted independence. The mom's comments about spending might be well-intentioned, but if they're coming across as controlling or overbearing, that's a problem. The author's frustration led them to take action by removing the mom from the account, which caused the mom to cry.\n\nNow, the key points are: 1) Is the author wrong to remove the mom from the joint account? 2) Did they overreact by getting angry and taking that action?\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, both parties have rights in a joint account. The author was within their rights to remove the mom, but the way they handled it (angrily) and the resulting emotional response might be seen as harsh. However, the mom's actions could be seen as invasive, especially if the author didn't want that level of oversight anymore.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they value their independence and privacy, which is understandable. The mom's concern might be genuine, but her methods of checking and calling repeatedly could be crossing a boundary. The author's decision to take action might be justified if they felt the mom was being intrusive, but the emotional impact on the mom is a consideration.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the joint account was set up with mutual consent and the mom's involvement was agreed upon, the author might be in the wrong for unilaterally removing her without discussing it first. However, if the mom was overstepping and the author communicated their discomfort without success, then the action could be justified.\n\nThe user's answer needs to weigh these factors. The final answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong, because the mom's actions, while possibly from a place of concern, were intrusive, and the author had the right to set boundaries. The emotional response of the mom is unfortunate, but the author's decision to remove her from the account was a personal boundary, which they have the right to enforce.\n"
