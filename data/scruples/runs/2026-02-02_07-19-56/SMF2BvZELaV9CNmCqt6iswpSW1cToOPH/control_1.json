Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account. The situation is that the author, now 25, has a joint account with their mom. They moved out at 21 due to controlling parents and have been self-sufficient since then.\n\nSo, the mom checks their spending history and comments on it, sometimes noticing discrepancies like extra charges. The author usually ignores her, but then she called multiple times about two car insurance payments in 15 days. The author got angry, felt it was snooping, and removed her from the account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nHmm. First, joint accounts typically mean both parties can view and access the funds. The mom might think she's helping, but the author feels it's an invasion of privacy. The author is 25 and independent, so it's reasonable they'd want financial autonomy. However, removing a parent from a joint account can be seen as cutting off a financial lifeline they might expect. \n\nBut the key points here are the age and independence. At 25, the author is an adult, and the mom's behavior could be overstepping. The fact that the author moved out and is self-sufficient suggests they should manage their own finances. The mom's persistent calls about spending might be overbearing. \n\nYet, the mom might have good intentions, thinking she's protecting or advising. The author's reaction\u2014removing her from the account\u2014could be harsh, but maybe justified if the mom's actions were causing stress. The author is in the right to set boundaries, especially if the joint account was a past arrangement for convenience. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting privacy, but maybe they could have handled it more gently. Still, the main issue is the mom's overreach, so the answer is likely B: No.\n"
