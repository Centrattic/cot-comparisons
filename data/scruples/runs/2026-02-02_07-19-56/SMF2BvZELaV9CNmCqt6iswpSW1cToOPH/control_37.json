Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 25-year-old who moved out and is self-sufficient. They had a joint bank account with their mom, which was useful when they were younger but now causes tension. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, leading to the author ending the joint account, making the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an adult, living independently, and managing their own finances. The joint account was originally set up to help them when they were younger, but now it's causing conflict. The mom's actions of checking the spending history and calling multiple times might be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is in their late 20s and should have financial autonomy.\n\nThe author's decision to remove the mom from the joint account could be seen as a necessary step to regain control over their finances. However, doing it in a way that makes the mom cry might indicate that there wasn't enough communication. The author got angry and cut things off abruptly, which might have been hurtful. But the mom's constant intrusion into the author's financial matters without consent is a privacy issue. \n\nIt's important to note that joint account holders do have access to each other's transactions, but the mom's behavior of contacting the author multiple times in a row during work could be seen as controlling or intrusive. The author's frustration is understandable, especially after moving out and wanting independence. Removing the mom from the account is a reasonable action to protect their privacy and autonomy. However, the abruptness and the emotional reaction might have been handled better with a more calm discussion first. But overall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to privacy and autonomy as an adult. The mom's actions contributed to the conflict. So the answer is likely B.\n"
