Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) did something wrong by making their mom cry after removing her from the joint bank account. The main issue is about privacy versus parental concern.\n\nFirst, the background: The person is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The joint account was set up when they were younger, so the mom could help with money. Now, the mom is checking the spending history and calling about expenses. The author felt it's an invasion of privacy and ended the joint account, leading to the mom crying.\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. The joint account was originally for convenience when the person was younger. But now that they're independent, continuing the joint account might not be necessary. \n2. The mother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's calling to question every expense. The author has the right to financial privacy once they're an adult.\n3. The author's decision to remove the mom from the account is a reasonable step to regain control over their finances. The mom's emotional reaction is unfortunate, but the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries.\n4. The mom's concern might be genuine, but her method is intrusive. The author's frustration is valid because they're managing their own money now.\n\nPossible angles: Some might argue that the mom is just looking out for her child, but others would see it as controlling. Since the author is an adult and independent, they have the right to manage their finances without parental interference. The mom might need to adjust to their independence.\n\nConclusion: The author isn't in the wrong. They set boundaries to protect their privacy after becoming self-sufficient, which is a reasonable action. The mom's reaction is a result of her own behavior, not the author's wrongdoing.\n"
