Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a joint bank account between the author (25 years old) and their mother. The author has been living independently since 21, moved across the country, and is self-sufficient. However, the mother frequently checks the spending history and comments on it. The author got angry when the mother called repeatedly about two car insurance payments and decided to remove the mother from the joint account, causing the mother to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. At 25, the author is an adult and has been living independently for four years. The joint account was originally for convenience when the author was younger, but that's no longer the case. The mother's actions, while well-intentioned, might be intrusive now that the author is an adult. The author has the right to financial privacy and autonomy.\n\nHowever, the mother might feel she's just looking out for her child, especially if there's a history of controlling behavior. The author's decision to remove the mother from the account was abrupt and without discussion, which could explain the mother's emotional reaction. But given the author's independence and the previous issues with controlling parents, the author's frustration is understandable.\n\nThe key points are the age and independence of the author, the mother's overstepping, and the method of resolving the issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting privacy, but the way they handled the situation might have been harsh. However, considering the context of past controlling behavior, the author's action is justified. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
