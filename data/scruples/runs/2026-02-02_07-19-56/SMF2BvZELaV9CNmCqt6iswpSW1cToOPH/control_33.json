Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from the joint account. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. They've had a joint account with their mom since they had a bank account. Now, the mom checks their spending and calls them about it, which the author finds intrusive. The author got angry when the mom called multiple times about two car insurance payments and decided to remove her from the joint account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the joint account and the boundaries between parent and adult child. The mom's actions might be seen as overstepping, especially since the child is an adult and independent. However, the mom might feel she's just looking out for them, given their history. The author's response was to cut off the joint access, which upset the mom.\n\nLegally, a joint account gives both parties access. If the author wants their privacy, removing the mom is a valid step. Emotionally, the mom is hurt, but the author has a right to control their own finances now. The author's frustration is understandable given the control issues mentioned when moving out. The mom's continuous calls about spending, especially when the author is managing their money, could be seen as controlling.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They removed the mom from the account, which was their right, but the mom was upset. The question is about whether the author's actions were justified. Since the author is an adult and the mom's intrusion was causing distress, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom should respect the adult child's autonomy. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
