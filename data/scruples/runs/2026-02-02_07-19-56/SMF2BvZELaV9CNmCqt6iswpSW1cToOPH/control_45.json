Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a joint bank account with their mom. The key points here are the joint account setup, the mother checking the spending history, the person moving out and becoming self-sufficient, and the recent conflict over car insurance payments leading to the mom crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of a joint account. When two people have a joint account, they typically have shared access and responsibility. However, the user moved out and is now 25, which is an adult age in many places. The mother's actions of monitoring the spending might be seen as overstepping, especially if the user is independent. \n\nThe user mentions that they used to accept the mother's comments about spending but got upset when she called multiple times about a specific issue. The user then decided to remove the mother from the account, which led to the mother crying. The question is whether the user is at fault here.\n\nFrom a financial perspective, having a joint account means both parties have access. However, if the user wants privacy, a joint account isn't appropriate. The user has the right to manage their own finances once they're independent. The mother's behavior of checking and commenting on expenses might be intrusive, and the user's reaction of removing the mother from the account could be a reasonable step to establish boundaries. \n\nEmotionally, the mother might feel hurt because she's used to being involved in the user's financial matters. But the user's decision to take control of their finances is a grown-up's move. The mother's crying might indicate that she wasn't expecting this action, but the user's primary issue was the invasion of privacy and lack of respect for their independence. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to manage their own money without surveillance, especially after moving out. The mother's actions could be seen as over-controlling, even if she means well. The user's decision to end the joint account is a way to set boundaries, which is a healthy action for their autonomy. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
