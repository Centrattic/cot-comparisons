Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a joint bank account with their mom, which the author started when they were younger. Now that they're 25 and living independently, the mom is checking the spending history and calling them about it. The author gets angry and removes the mom from the account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom might see the joint account as a way to help and monitor, especially if they had a history of needing her input when they were younger. But the author is now an adult and wants independence. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is self-sufficient now. However, the mom's intentions might be to care, even if the method is intrusive.\n\nThe key points are the age of the account, the transition to independence, and the conflict over privacy. The author might feel that their privacy is violated, especially after moving out and managing on their own. On the other hand, removing someone from a joint account without discussion could be seen as abrupt. But if the mom wasn't contributing to the account anymore, the joint status might not make sense. \n\nI should also think about legal and social norms. A joint account typically allows both parties access, so the mom's actions are technically allowed. However, the author's frustration is valid if they feel their autonomy is being ignored. The mom's crying suggests emotional distress, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be in the wrong because they're asserting their independence. However, the way they handled it (removing the mom without discussion) could be improved. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author's actions were a response to ongoing privacy issues, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). The mom might need to respect the author's independence, even if her intentions are caring.\n"
