Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from their joint account. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has a joint bank account with their mom since they were young. That setup made sense when they were living at home, but now they're 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending history and comments on it, sometimes pointing out things like extra charges. The author usually ignores it but got angry when the mom called five times about car insurance payments and then took her off the account, making her cry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age and independence of the author. At 25, they're an adult, which is a significant factor. The joint account was originally for convenience when they were a child, but now it's causing conflict. The mom's actions of checking the spending could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is living independently. \n\nHowever, the mom's intentions might be to help, but the way she's doing it is intrusive. The author's reaction of getting angry and removing the mom from the account is a response to feeling snooped on. It's a boundary issue. The mom might feel hurt because she's used to managing the account together, but the author is asserting their independence. \n\nIs the author wrong? If the account was meant for the author's benefit when they were younger, then at 25, they have the right to manage their finances independently. The mom's continued involvement without the author's consent could be the real issue here. The author's action might be justified as setting a boundary. The mom crying is a result of the situation, but the root cause is the conflict between parental control and adult independence. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are establishing their autonomy as an adult. The mom's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are intrusive, and the author has the right to control their own bank account now.\n"
