Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has a joint account with their mom since they were younger. Now that they're 25 and living independently, the mom checks their spending, calls them about expenses, and it led to conflict. The author got angry and removed the mom from the account, making the mom cry.\n\nSo, the key points here. The joint account was set up when the author was younger, likely for convenience. The mom's interference might be out of concern but is coming off as overbearing. The author feels their privacy is invaded, which is a valid concern as an adult. The mom's actions\u2014calling multiple times about expenses\u2014could be seen as controlling, especially since the author is now self-sufficient. \n\nThe author's response was to end the joint account, which is their right. They have autonomy over their finances. The mom crying is a reaction, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. The problem is whether the author's action was justified. Removing someone from a joint account is a significant step, but given the context of control issues and adult independence, it might be reasonable.\n\nThe question is about accountability. The author isn't wrong for wanting privacy and financial independence. The mom's behavior crosses into overstepping, especially after the author has moved out and is managing their own life. The author's decision to stop the joint account is a boundary-setting action, which is healthy. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
