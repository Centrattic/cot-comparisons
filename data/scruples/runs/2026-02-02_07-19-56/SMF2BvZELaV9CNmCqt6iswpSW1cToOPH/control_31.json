Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between a 25-year-old and their mom. The mom checks the spending history, comments on spending, and calls multiple times about an expense. The author gets angry, removes the mom from the account, and the mom cries.\n\nFirst, the age and independence factors. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is self-sufficient. That's an adult, so they might feel their financial privacy is important. The joint account was originally for convenience when they were younger, but now it's causing conflict.\n\nThe mom's actions: checking spending and commenting. While she's trying to help, it might come off as intrusive. The author feels their privacy is invaded, leading to frustration. The mom's calls during work might be seen as overreaching.\n\nThe author's response: removing the mom from the account. That's a valid action if they want control over their finances. But it led to the mom crying, which is emotional. The question is whether the author overstepped by doing this without discussing it first.\n\nPossible angles: The mom might feel she's just being protective, but the author has the right to manage their own money. However, the abrupt action without communication could be seen as harsh. But considering the author's history of controlling parents, they might have valid reasons for wanting independence.\n\nIs the author wrong? They have a right to their privacy and autonomy. The mom's behavior was overstepping, so removing her might be justified. However, the way it was handled could be improved. But the core issue is about boundaries. So the answer might be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their independence.\n"
