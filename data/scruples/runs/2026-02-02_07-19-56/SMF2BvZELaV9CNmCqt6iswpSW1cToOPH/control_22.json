Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a joint bank account between the person and their mom, and the person is upset because the mom checks their spending and calls them about it. The person then removes the mom from the account, causing the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. The joint account was set up when they were younger, so the mom could help with money. Now, the mom is checking the spending and making comments. The person feels it's an invasion of privacy, especially when the mom calls multiple times about specific expenses. The person got angry and removed the mom from the account, leading to emotional response from the mom.\n\nSo, the key points here are about privacy, control, and boundaries. When you're an adult and self-sufficient, having a joint account with a parent can be a gray area. The mom might believe she's helping by monitoring expenses, but the adult child might see it as overstepping. The problem is that the joint account inherently allows both parties to access the funds, so maybe the mom didn't realize her snooping was an issue until it was brought up.\n\nThe person's reaction was to remove the mom from the account. Was that the right move? Well, if the account is supposed to be joint, then both have access. If the person wanted privacy, maybe they should have separated the accounts earlier. However, the mom's constant calls and checking spending could be seen as controlling, even if done with good intentions. The person might have felt they needed to set a boundary, hence removing the mom.\n\nBut then, the mom cried. So there's an emotional impact. However, the person was the one who had moved out and was self-sufficient, so maybe they were within their rights to want privacy. The mom might have overstepped, even if she thought she was helping. The person's anger and the action of removing the mom might be justified as a way to enforce personal boundaries, especially given the history of controlling parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have felt that she was still responsible for the child's financial well-being, given the joint account. But once an adult is independent, others might not have the right to interfere in their financial decisions unless there's a mutual agreement. The fact that the person had to take action suggests that the previous arrangement wasn't working for them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect. The mom might not have realized that the person wanted privacy, and the person might not have communicated that clearly. However, the person's action of removing the mom could be seen as a necessary step to set boundaries. The mom's crying could be a result of feeling hurt, but the person's frustration is valid if they felt their privacy was invaded.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the person isn't in the wrong. They were asserting their independence and privacy, which is important for an adult. The mom's behavior crossed a line, even if she had good intentions. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
