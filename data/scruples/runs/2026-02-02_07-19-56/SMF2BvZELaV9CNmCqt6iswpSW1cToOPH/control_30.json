Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account where the mother has access to the author's spending history. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and now handles their own finances.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics of a joint account. When you share an account with someone, both parties typically have access to the funds and transactions. The mother's actions of checking the spending might be seen as part of her role in managing the joint account, even if it's intrusive to the author. However, the author feels that the mother's snooping and constant calls are overstepping, especially since they are now independent and living separately.\n\nThe author's decision to remove the mother from the account is their way of asserting financial independence. While the mother's intentions might be to help or monitor, the author perceives it as controlling. The emotional response from the mother is significant, but the author's actions were a direct response to years of feeling monitored. \n\nLegally, in a joint account, both parties do have access, so the mother's checks aren't inherently wrong. However, the mother's approach\u2014calling multiple times and prying into expenses\u2014might not respect the author's autonomy. The author's frustration is valid given their independence. Ending the joint account to set boundaries isn't necessarily wrong, especially when it affects their work and personal space. \n\nSo considering the balance between the mother's intentions and the author's need for independence, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect their privacy and autonomy, even if it caused emotional distress.\n"
