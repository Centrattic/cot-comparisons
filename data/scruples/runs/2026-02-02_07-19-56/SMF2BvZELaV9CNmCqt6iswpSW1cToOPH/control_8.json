Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for making their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the user and their mother. When the user was younger, this setup was helpful because the mom could add money as needed. Now the user is 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom often comments on their spending, which the user usually ignores. But now, the mom called multiple times about seeing two car insurance payments in 15 days, which upset the user. They got angry and removed the mom from the account, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the joint account dynamics. When you have a joint account, both parties typically have access to the information. The user might feel their privacy is invaded because the mom is checking their spending and calling them about it. The mom, on the other hand, might be concerned about their financial habits, especially if she's been involved in managing finances before. The user is now independent, so expecting privacy makes sense. But the mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, given that the user is an adult and self-sufficient.\n\nThe user's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which is their right since it's a joint account. However, the mom crying suggests emotional impact. The user might be in the right because they have the right to privacy and control over their finances now that they're independent. But maybe there's a middle ground, like discussing the account setup without cutting the mom off abruptly. However, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. If the mom was sifting through the account without consent, that's an issue. But since it's a joint account, both have access. The user's frustration is valid because the mom's interference continued even after the user moved out and became self-sufficient. The action of removing the mom might be justified as asserting independence, even if it upset her. So, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They have a right to control their finances now, and the mom's snooping was disrespectful of their independence. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
