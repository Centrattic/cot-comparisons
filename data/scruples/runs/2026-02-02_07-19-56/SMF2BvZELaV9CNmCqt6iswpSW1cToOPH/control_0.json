Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 25-year-old who moved out and became self-sufficient. The mom has been checking their joint bank account spending, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The person had a joint account with their mom since having a bank account, which was helpful when they were younger. Now that they're older and independent, the mom's continued access might be an issue. The person feels that their mom is overstepping by checking their spending and calling them about it, even leading to a confrontation where they removed the mom from the account, causing the mom to cry.\n\nThe key points to consider: age and independence, joint account implications, boundaries, and the mom's intentions. At 25, the person is an adult and has moved out, so expecting privacy in their finances might be reasonable. However, a joint account typically means both parties have access and the right to monitor. The person decided to remove the mom from the account, which could be seen as a boundary-setting action, but it also might leave the mom feeling hurt because she was used to being involved in the child's financial well-being.\n\nThe mom's actions might stem from concern, but the person feels it's intrusive. The person's frustration is understandable, especially if the calls are frequent and unwelcome. However, the method of removing the mom from the account without discussing it first could be seen as abrupt, leading to emotional distress.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? If the joint account was mutual, both had the right to access. The person's decision to remove the mom might be justified in seeking privacy, but the way it was handled (without prior discussion) could have been more considerate. On the other hand, the mom's persistent checking might be overstepping, especially if the person is an adult and self-sufficient. The person's reaction is about setting boundaries, which is reasonable, but the consequence made the mom cry, which is a negative outcome.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the person had the right to remove the mom from the account. If the account was joint, both had the right, so maybe the person isn't in the wrong. However, the emotional impact on the mom could be seen as a result of not communicating better. But the core issue is about boundaries and privacy versus concern. I think the person isn't in the wrong because they are asserting their independence, but maybe could have handled it with more communication. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
