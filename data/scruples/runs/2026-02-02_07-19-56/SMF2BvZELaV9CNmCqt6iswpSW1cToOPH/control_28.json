Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is at fault for making their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person has a joint account with their mom since childhood. Now that they're 25, living independently, and self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending and comments on it, which the person finds intrusive. The mom called multiple times about a car insurance charge, leading the person to remove her from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nSo, the main points: joint account with a parent, adult child now independent, parent's monitoring is seen as overstepping, leading to conflict. The person's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which upset the mom.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, a joint account allows both parties access. Removing someone might be a breach unless there's a legal right to do so. But the question is more about moral or social wrong, not legal.\n\nMentally, the mom's actions could be seen as overbearing, especially since the person is an adult and independent. The parent's concern might stem from worry, but the intrusion is problematic. The person's frustration is understandable. However, the author's action of removing the mom without discussing it first might be abrupt and hurtful. \n\nBut considering the mom was calling during work and the person felt snoopied, the response could be justified. However, removing someone from a joint account is a significant step and could be seen as cutting off a parent, which might be harsh. But the person has the right to control their finances as an adult. The mom's behavior was invasive, so the person's action is a way to set boundaries.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe discussing the issue instead of removing access immediately. But the author did feel it was necessary. The mom's crying could be due to feeling rejected or worried about the financial arrangement. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is an adult with the right to manage their own finances. The mom's behavior was overstepping, so the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their privacy and autonomy. The answer would be B, No.\n"
