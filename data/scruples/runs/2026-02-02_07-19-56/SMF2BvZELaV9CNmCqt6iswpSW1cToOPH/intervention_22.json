Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account with her. The situation is that they've been in a joint account since having a bank account, which their mom used to manage when they were younger. Now they're 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending and comments on it, which the person usually ignores. But when the mom called multiple times about a car insurance payment, the person got angry and removed the mom from the account, leading to the mom crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are the joint account and the mom's involvement in their finances. The person feels their privacy is invaded because the mom is checking their spending and calling them about it. The mom, on the other hand, might see it as her role to help or monitor, especially if she's been doing it since they were younger. The person ends the joint account, which causes emotional distress to the mom.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the person's perspective, they're adults, independent, and likely want their financial privacy. The mom's constant checking might be overstepping, especially if they're capable of managing their money. But the mom might believe she's helping, especially if she's been involved in their finances for a long time. The fact that they ended the account in anger might have been abrupt, causing the mom to cry. However, the person's right to control their own finances is important. \n\nThere's a balance between parental concern and adult autonomy. If the mom is not providing financial support anymore and the person is self-sufficient, the mom's monitoring could be intrusive. The person might be justified in ending the joint account to protect their privacy. But the way it was handled\u2014removing the mom without discussion and in anger\u2014could be seen as harsh. However, the underlying issue is about control and privacy. \n\nI think the person isn't entirely in the wrong because they have the right to financial independence. However, handling it without a conversation might have been a mistake. But the core issue is the mom's continued involvement when the person is grown. So the person's action, while maybe tactless, is about asserting their independence. Therefore, the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
