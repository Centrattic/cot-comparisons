Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a joint bank account with their mom. They've been out of the house since 21, are now 25, and self-sufficient. The mom is checking their spending and calling them about it, which the author finds intrusive. The author got angry and removed the mom from the joint account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom probably set up the joint account for support when the author was younger. Now that the author is independent, the mom might still feel protective, leading her to monitor the account. But the author feels that this is an invasion of privacy, especially since they are adults and managing their own finances. \n\nThe key points here are the joint account's purpose and boundaries. When you have a joint account, both parties typically have access to the funds and transactions. So, the mom isn't necessarily \"snooping\" but has the right to see the transactions. However, the author might feel that this access is no longer appropriate as they are now independent. \n\nThe author's decision to remove the mom from the account is a reaction to feeling controlled, which they had a previous issue with. The mom's actions might be well-intentioned but could be overstepping, especially if the author is capable of managing their finances. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if they had a joint account, the mom's access to the transactions is legitimate. The author's anger at being monitored, even if it's part of the account's nature, might be justified if the mom's actions are intrusive. However, the author didn't communicate this before removing the mom from the account, which caused emotional distress. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for removing the mom, as they have the right to manage the account. But maybe they could have handled it better by discussing it first. However, the question is about whether they are in the wrong. The mom's actions might be well-meaning but overstepping, so the author's response could be seen as justified. Alternatively, since the account is joint, the mom's checking it isn't wrong, so the author removing her could be wrong. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. If the author wanted privacy, maybe they should have opened a separate account. But the mom's constant calls and accusations might make the author feel that the joint account isn't necessary anymore. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to control their account. The mom's actions might be overstepping, so the author's response is a way to set boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
