Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a joint bank account with their mom. The user is 25, moved out at 21, and now self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history, comments on their spending, and the user got upset and removed her from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically mean both parties have access to the account. That includes viewing transactions. So from a legal standpoint, the mom has every right to look at the account. But the problem here is more about the dynamics between them. The user feels the mom is overstepping, even though she's within her rights. The user got angry and removed the mom, which upset her.\n\nNow, considering their past: the user moved out because of controlling parents. Maybe the mom's checking the account is a continuation of that control. The user is trying to establish independence. But removing the mom from the joint account is a significant action. If the account is joint, removing someone without discussion might be abrupt. However, the mom was using the joint account to monitor spending, which the user found intrusive.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the mom had a right to check the account. The user's reaction was anger and taking action without perhaps discussing boundaries first. But the user has a right to privacy and autonomy now, especially after moving out and being self-sufficient. The mom's behavior might be overbearing, given the history. The emotional response (crying) shows the mom was hurt, but the user's action was a response to feeling controlled. \n\nSo, the question is whether the user was wrong to remove the mom from the account. On one hand, the mom's actions were within her rights as a co-owner. On the other, the user has a right to privacy. However, the user could have addressed the issue more calmly, maybe set boundaries first before removing the mom. But if the mom continued to invade privacy despite the user's discomfort, the user might have a valid reason to end the joint account. \n\nIn terms of accountability, maybe the user isn't entirely wrong because they needed to assert their independence. But they could have handled it differently to avoid making the mom cry. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to privacy and self-determination, especially given their history. The mom's actions, while legal, were emotionally damaging, so the user's reaction, though harsh, is understandable.\n"
