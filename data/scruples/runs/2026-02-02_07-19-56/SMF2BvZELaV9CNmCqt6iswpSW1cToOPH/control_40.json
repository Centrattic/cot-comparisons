Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. So the scenario is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, leading to the author blocking her from the account after getting angry. The mom cried, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. Typically, a joint account means both parties have access, but that can lead to privacy issues. The mom's actions of checking the spending and calling about it might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author feels it's an invasion of privacy. However, the mom might believe she's helping or being responsible since it's a joint account.\n\nThe author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account because they were upset. The mom cried, which the author might feel guilty about. But the author's frustration is about the mom's constant monitoring and intrusion, which they find controlling. The author is trying to establish independence after leaving home, so this conflict is about personal boundaries.\n\nI should also consider cultural factors. In some cultures, parents are more involved in their adult children's finances, but in others, independence is expected. The author's situation suggests they wanted to move out due to controlling parents, so the mom's continued interference might be part of that control.\n\nThe key points are: the mom's snooping, the author's need for privacy, and the method of conflict resolution (removing the mom from the account). Was the author justified in taking that step? The author was within their rights to remove someone from a joint account, but the emotional impact on the mom might be seen as harsh. However, the mom's actions were also intrusive.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the mom has a right to access the account, but the author felt it necessary to stop that to maintain their independence, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. But removing someone from an account without prior discussion could be seen as abrupt, potentially causing hurt. However, given the history of controlling behavior, the author might have valid reasons.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author is asserting their independence and privacy, which is important for an adult. The mom's actions were overstepping, and the author's response, while causing emotional distress, was a reasonable way to set boundaries after prior issues. The AITA depends on whether the mom's actions were justified in monitoring a joint account. Since the author is self-sufficient, maybe the mom shouldn't be involved. So the author isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
