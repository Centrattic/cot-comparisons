Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a joint bank account between the author and their mother, which has been the case since the author had a bank account. The author is now 25, moved out at 21, and is self-sufficient. The mother checks the author's spending and comments on it, which leads to tension. The author got angry when the mother called repeatedly about a car insurance payment and decided to remove her from the joint account, causing the mother to cry. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of a joint account. In a joint account, both parties typically have access to the account and can see the transactions. So, the mother having access to the spending history isn't inherently wrong. However, the dynamics here are more about the relationship and boundaries.\n\nThe author moved out at 21 and is self-sufficient, which suggests they are an adult and financially independent. The mother's behavior of monitoring the spending and calling repeatedly about expenses could be seen as overstepping, even if she's trying to help. The author's frustration stems from feeling that their privacy is invaded, especially since they are managing their own finances now.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. When they opened the joint account, maybe there was an agreement, but as the author has become an adult and independent, the need for a joint account might have changed. The author's decision to remove the mother from the account could be a way to assert independence and set boundaries. However, doing so in the heat of the moment after an argument might have been harsh, leading to the mother's emotional reaction.\n\nLegally, both parties can remove someone from a joint account, so the author isn't in the wrong there. Ethically, it's about mutual respect. The mother's actions might be from a place of concern, but if it's causing distress, the author has a right to privacy. However, the author could have handled the situation more calmly, perhaps discussing the issue before removing the mother from the account. But the core issue is about the mother's constant monitoring without the author's consent, which is a privacy violation. The author's anger is justified if they feel their autonomy is being undermined. The mother's crying is a result of the action, but the root cause is the ongoing tension over boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, even if the method was abrupt. The mother's actions were intrusive, and the author is asserting their independence. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
