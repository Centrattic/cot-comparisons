Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is at fault for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the person is 25, moved out at 21 to escape controlling parents, and has been self-sufficient since. The joint account was set up when they were younger, and the mom has been checking their spending. The person got annoyed because their mom called them multiple times at work about a car insurance payment, leading to the person removing the mom from the account. The mom cried after that.\n\nSo, the key points here: The joint account might have been necessary when the person was younger, but now that they're independent, it's causing conflict. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the person is clearly managing their own finances. The person's reaction (removing the mom from the account) is a way to set a boundary. However, the mom's emotional reaction is a result of that action.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, they were in a controlling environment before, which might justify their need for independence. However, cutting off the joint account abruptly might have been harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss the situation first. But given the mom's history of intrusive behavior, the person might feel justified in taking action to protect their autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel hurt because she was trying to help. But the person is now an adult and should have the right to manage their own finances without constant oversight. The fact that the person had to remove the mom after multiple calls at work shows a lack of respect for their boundaries by the mom. So, the author's actions are a response to that ongoing issue.\n\nTherefore, considering the context of parental control and the person's need for independence, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their autonomy after being in a controlling environment. The mom's reaction is unfortunate, but the author's actions are a justified boundary.\n"
