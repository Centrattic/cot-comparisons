Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from the joint account.\n\nFirst, the setup: The person has a joint account with their mom since they were young. Now they're 25, independent, and moved out. The mom checks their spending, gives unsolicited advice, and calls multiple times about something minor (two car insurance payments). The author got angry, ended the joint account, and mom cried. The question is if the author is wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let's break down the factors. \n\nOn one hand, the mom might be overstepping. The person is an adult, living independently, and managing their own finances. The mom's constant monitoring and calls could be seen as intrusive, even if her intentions are to help. The author's reaction\u2014removing the mom from the account\u2014might be a form of setting a boundary to stop the harassment.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have good intentions, trying to look out for her child's financial well-being. She might feel concerned and reach out when she notices something. The author's anger and abrupt action caused emotional distress, which is a valid point against them.\n\nBut considering the author is an adult and the joint account is a shared responsibility, perhaps the mom should respect the adult child's independence. The author's right to privacy in their financial matters after moving out and being self-sufficient is a key point. The mom's repeated calls during work time could be seen as disrespectful, prompting the author's justified anger.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They acted to stop the mom's overstepping, which is reasonable. However, the way they handled it caused emotional harm. Maybe a middle ground could have been found, like discussing boundaries. But the mom's behavior might have been the root issue. Given that the author is now independent, removing the joint account could be a necessary step for their autonomy. The mom's crying is unfortunate, but the author's action was a response to ongoing issues. So, perhaps the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
