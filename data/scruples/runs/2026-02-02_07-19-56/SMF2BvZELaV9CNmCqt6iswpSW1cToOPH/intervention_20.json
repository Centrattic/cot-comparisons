Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a 25-year-old who's been in a joint bank account with their mom. The mom checks the spending history and calls the author about it, leading to the author removing her from the account and making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The joint account was initially set up for convenience when the author was younger. Now that the author is 25, independent, and living on their own, the setup might be causing issues. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author is now responsible for their own finances. On the other hand, the mom might feel she's looking out for her child's financial well-being.\n\nThe author got angry and removed their mom from the account without much discussion, which led to her crying. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that their privacy is being invaded. Being in a joint account gives the mom access to their spending, which can be frustrating if they're trying to manage their own money. The constant calls about expenses could be seen as controlling, which the author has previously struggled with (moving away due to controlling parents). Removing the mom from the account could be a step towards asserting independence and setting boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author might not have addressed the issue with their mom first. Instead of just removing her, discussing the concerns and setting boundaries might have been a better approach. The sudden action without communication could have caused hurt feelings, which is where the \"AITA\" part comes in. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions could be seen as overbearing. Even if her intentions are good, the method of checking the account and calling repeatedly might be too intrusive. The author's reaction is a response to a long-standing issue, not just a single incident. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author's action was a reaction to ongoing issues and a desire for autonomy. However, the way they handled it (removing the mom without discussion) might have been abrupt. But considering the context of controlling parents and the author's need for independence, it's more about setting boundaries rather than being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
