Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account due to her checking their spending. \n\nThe situation involves a joint account between the user and their mother. From childhood, this setup was convenient for the user to get money from their mom. Now, at 25, the user is independent but still has the joint account. The mom frequently checks the spending, offers unsolicited advice, and calls about specific expenses, like duplicate car insurance payments. The user, frustrated, removes the mom from the account, leading to her crying.\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics of a joint account. Both parties have access, so transparency is inherent. The mother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially if the user feels their financial autonomy is being invaded. But joint accounts do come with shared responsibility, so the mom might believe she's helping or monitoring to prevent overspending. \n\nThe user's reaction\u2014removing the mom from the account in anger\u2014might be seen as cutting off a support line. However, the user has been self-sufficient for years, so the need for a joint account might have outlived its purpose. The mother's repeated calls during work could be intrusive, adding to the user's frustration. \n\nThe user's argument is about autonomy and privacy. The mom's actions, while well-intentioned, may not consider the user's adult independence. Ending the joint account is a boundary-setting action, which is reasonable if the user wants privacy. However, doing it in anger without discussion could be seen as harsh, especially if it caused emotional distress. \n\nThe key points are: joint account implies shared access, both sides have access to each other's transactions. The user's decision to remove the mom ends that access, which could be seen as cutting off a parental support system. But the mother's behavior might be overbearing. \n\nThe user's actions could be justified if they needed more privacy, but the method (anger) and the resulting emotional harm might tip the balance. However, if the mother's behavior was indeed controlling, then the user's action is a response to that control. \n\nIn conclusion, the user wants autonomy, the mother oversteps. Ending the account is a boundary, but the emotional impact is a factor. So, depending on perspective, the answer might be either way. But the user's right to privacy and independence is important, so maybe they are not in the wrong.\n"
