Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account after she snoopers their spending. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom. The author moved out at 21, became self-sufficient, and now the mom is checking their spending, which is bothering them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects of a joint account. In a joint account, both parties usually have equal access, so the mom's actions might be within her rights. However, the emotional aspect is important too. The author feels that the mom is being overbearing and invading their privacy, even after becoming independent. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. The key points are the control the parents had before, the author's current independence, and the mom's persistent checking. The author's reaction was removing the mom from the account, leading to the mom crying. \n\nI should balance the rights of the joint account holder against the author's need for privacy. If the mom has a right to check the account, but the author feels it's intrusive, maybe the issue is about boundaries. The author's decision to remove the mom might be legally valid, but is it emotionally the right thing? \n\nThe mom might feel hurt because she's trying to care, even if it's overstepping. The author's anger and abrupt action caused emotional distress. However, the mom's actions could also be seen as unnecessary interference once the author is independent. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the mom's actions were justified. Since the account is joint, she has access. The author might have a right to end the joint account if they don't want to share access anymore. However, the way they handled it\u2014removing the mom without discussing it\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the account was meant for support when they were younger and now the mom is still monitoring, maybe the author is justified in ending it. The mom's crying is a result of the action, but the author's right to privacy as an adult might outweigh that. \n\nHmm, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to manage their finances independently now. The mom's behavior is overstepping, and the author's action is a way to set boundaries. Even though it made the mom cry, it's about the author's autonomy. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
