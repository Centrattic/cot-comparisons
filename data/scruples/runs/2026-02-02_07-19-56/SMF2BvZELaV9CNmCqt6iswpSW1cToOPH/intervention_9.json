Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending and calls them about it, which the author finds intrusive. The author got angry and took the mom off the joint account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. When two people have a joint account, they typically share access and responsibility. So, the mom having access to the spending history isn't inherently wrong. But the issue arises from how she's using that access. The author feels that the mom is snooping and overstepping by calling them about their spending, which is leading to conflict.\n\nThe author is in their 20s, established as an adult, living independently. The mom's behavior might be coming from a place of concern but it's crossing into being controlling. The author's reaction\u2014removing the mom from the account\u2014might be a way to set a boundary, but it's done in a way that caused emotional harm (the mom cried). \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to privacy and autonomy over their finances once they're an adult. If the joint account was initially for convenience (like the mom adding money when needed), the author might feel it's no longer necessary now that they're independent. Removing the mom could be seen as a necessary step to regain control.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions might stem from genuine concern. Even if the author finds it intrusive, the mom might not realize she's overstepping. The author's reaction of anger and removing the mom abruptly could be seen as harsh, especially without addressing the issue calmly first. The mom's crying suggests that the action hurt her feelings, possibly because she saw it as being cut off or not trusted.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the mom's monitoring was part of an agreement when setting up the joint account, then the author might have breached that trust by removing her without discussion. However, if the arrangement was never formalized and the author felt the need for more privacy, their action could be justified. The key points are intent and communication. If the author had a conversation with the mom about their desire for privacy instead of cutting her off, that might have been a better approach. The fact that the author got angry and acted impulsively (calling her 5 times in a row) might indicate immaturity in handling the situation, which could place some blame on the author.\n\nAlternatively, the mom's constant intrusion into the author's financial life, especially after they've established independence, is problematic. The author's decision to end the joint account could be a healthy boundary-setting, but the method caused unnecessary emotional distress. The author's responsibility is to communicate boundaries respectfully rather than through anger. The mom's role is to respect the adult child's autonomy. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for wanting privacy, but the way they handled it (getting angry, removing the mom without prior discussion) might be where the fault lies. Conversely, the mom's overstepping is also an issue. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. Since the parent is the one initiating the intrusion, the author's response to set a boundary could be seen as necessary, but executed poorly. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the joint account was necessary and if the author gave the mom a chance to adjust. If the situation was ongoing and the author felt it was causing stress without resolution, then removing the mom might be justified. However, the emotional response (getting angry, causing the mom to cry) could indicate that the author handled it poorly, making them partially at fault. But if the mom's actions were consistently invasive, the author's decision to end the joint account is a valid self-protective measure.\n"
