Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a joint bank account with the mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and now the mom checks their spending, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically allow both parties to access the funds. So the mom might feel entitled to check the account because she's a joint owner. But the author feels it's an invasion of privacy. The mom is a controlling parent, which is mentioned, so maybe that's part of the issue.\n\nThe author got angry and ended the relationship over the account, making the mom cry. Is this justified? The mom might have a right to check the account, but maybe she's overstepping by calling repeatedly and criticizing spending. The author's reaction could be seen as cutting off a parent, but they might feel their autonomy is important.\n\nI need to balance the rights of joint account holders versus personal privacy. The mom's actions might be overbearing, but the author's reaction was to remove her from the account, which could be cutting ties. Depending on cultural context, family dynamics matter. The author could be justified in wanting control now that they're independent. Alternatively, the mom's concern might be genuine but poorly handled.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the mom has a right to the account, removing her could be wrong. But if the mom is being controlling, the author might be right to set boundaries. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they're asserting independence. But some might argue A because joint accounts mean shared access.\n"
