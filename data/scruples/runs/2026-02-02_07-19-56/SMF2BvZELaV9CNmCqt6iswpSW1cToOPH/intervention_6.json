Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The mom checks the author's spending history and calls them about it, leading to the author cutting her off and making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The account is joint, so both have access. The mom's actions are based on concern, even if it's overstepping. The author is now 25, living independently, and feels that the mom's intrusion into their financial decisions is controlling. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. After moving out and being self-sufficient, having a parent constantly monitor and question their spending could feel invasive. However, the mom is part of the joint account, so she has legal access to the information. Her intentions might be to help, but the method is problematic. \n\nThe author's response was to remove the mom from the account, which caused emotional distress. While setting boundaries is important, doing so in a way that makes the mom cry might be seen as harsh. The author could have had a conversation to address the issue instead of abruptly cutting off access. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's repeated calls during work might have been inconsiderate, especially if the author was already stressed or busy. The author's right to privacy and autonomy in their finances, especially as an adult, is a valid point. The mom might need to respect the author's independence, even if it's with good intentions.\n\nBalancing both sides, the key is whether the author's actions were justified. The mom's behavior was intrusive, but the author's reaction might have been too abrupt. There's a middle ground where they could communicate better. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but the way they handled it could be improved. But the question is if they are in the wrong. Since they caused their mom to cry, maybe there's some fault there. However, the mom was also overstepping. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because they were asserting their independence, even if the method could be better.\n"
