Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from the joint bank account.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their mom have a joint account. When the author was younger, this was helpful for financial management. Now the author is 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and offers comments, which the author usually ignores. But when the mom called multiple times about a car insurance payment, the author got angry and removed her from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nSo, the key points here. A joint account typically means both parties have access to the funds and can see the transactions. The mom's actions are framed as concern, but the author feels it's intrusive. The author's reaction was cutting off the mom from the account, leading to emotional distress.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the opinion. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, a joint account usually allows both parties equal access. So removing the other person could be within the author's rights. However, the emotional impact is a big factor here. The mom was crying, which suggests that the action hurt her feelings. But was the action justified? The author might feel that their financial autonomy is important, especially after moving out and being independent. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's monitoring could be seen as well-meaning but overstepping, especially since the author is an adult. The author's decision to stop the mom from accessing the account might be a way to set boundaries. However, the method (removing access without prior discussion) could be seen as abrupt and hurtful. \n\nIf the author had communicated their need for privacy first, perhaps the outcome would have been different. But the author's action, while perhaps legally or logically justified, caused emotional harm. The mom might have felt rejected or untrusted. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a choice that led to the mom's distress. Even if the author felt wronged, the action that caused the crying is the focus here. So, the author might share some responsibility. However, the mom's initial behavior (monitoring and calling repeatedly) is also questionable. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong for making the mom cry. The author's action directly led to that. While the mom's behavior was perhaps intrusive, the author's response could be seen as a necessary boundary, but the way it was executed caused emotional harm. \n\nIn many cases, setting boundaries is important, but doing so in a way that causes emotional distress might be considered inconsiderate. So, the author might be partially at fault for not handling it more sensitively. Alternatively, if the mom was overstepping, the author's action is justified even if it caused upset. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author's autonomy is important, but so is respecting the mother's feelings, especially if the joint account was part of a long-standing financial arrangement. The author could have transitioned to a separate account gradually. Removing the mom abruptly might not be the kindest approach. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a case for both sides. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the author made a decision that directly caused emotional harm, even if motivated by a need for privacy, it's possible the author is partially at fault. But if the mom was indeed overstepping, the author's action is a form of self-advocacy.\n"
