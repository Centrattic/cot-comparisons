Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from the joint account. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their mom have a joint bank account. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and calls the author about it, leading to the author cutting her off. The mom cried, and the author feels justified but is unsure.\n\nThe author's perspective is that the mom was being controlling and snooping, which led to frustration. The mom's perspective is that she's looking out for her child's financial well-being. \n\nNow, considering joint accounts: When you have a joint account, both parties typically have access to the funds and transactions. The mom's actions of checking the spending might not be illegal, but the issue is more about privacy and boundaries. The author might feel that their autonomy is being invaded, especially since they are an adult and self-sufficient. \n\nThe mom's concern could stem from genuine care, but the way she's approaching it\u2014calling multiple times and pointing out expenses\u2014might come across as overbearing. However, the author's reaction of removing the mom from the account and doing so in a way that made her cry could be seen as harsh. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the joint account was a mutual agreement, removing someone without discussion could be abrupt. However, if the mom's behavior was consistently intrusive, the author has a right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the actions were proportional. The author was upset and took action without perhaps having a discussion, leading to emotional harm.\n\nOn one hand, the author is asserting their independence. On the other, the method might have been too harsh. But since the mom was already making the author uncomfortable, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's a balance between autonomy and parental concern.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're asserting their independence, but it's a close call. However, considering the context of the mom's behavior being intrusive and the author's efforts to be self-sufficient, the answer is B (No).\n"
