Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who made their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account is at fault.\n\nFirst, the background: The person has a joint account with their mom since they were young. Now that they're 25 and independent, living across the country, their mom still checks their spending. The user feels it's an invasion of privacy, especially when their mom calls repeatedly about expenses. They got angry and removed her from the account, leading to the mom crying.\n\nSo, the main points here are privacy, independence, and control. The joint account was useful when the person was younger, but now they're an adult. The mom's actions might stem from concern, but it could also be overstepping. \n\nIn many cases, once someone is an adult and independent, they should have the right to manage their finances without parental oversight, even if the account is joint. The mom's repeated calls during work could be seen as intrusive. The user's reaction\u2014removing the mom from the account\u2014might be a way to set a boundary. \n\nBut there's a nuance. The mom might have a legitimate interest if the account is truly joint, but the user's frustration is understandable. The key is whether the mom's actions were justified. If the account was meant for support when the user was younger, it might be time to adjust that as the user becomes more independent. \n\nLegally, joint account holders can have access to each other's transactions, but emotionally, the user is asserting their autonomy. The mom crying might be from feeling rejected or unappreciated, but the user's right to privacy in their adult life is valid. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the mom's actions were appropriate. Since the user is an adult and the mom's behavior seems controlling despite the distance, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
