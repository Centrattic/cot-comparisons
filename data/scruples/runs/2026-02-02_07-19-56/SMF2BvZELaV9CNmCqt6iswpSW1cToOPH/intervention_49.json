Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom frequently checks their spending and calls them about it, which leads to the author removing her from the joint account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The account is joint, so both have access. The mom's actions might be seen as overstepping if she's prying into the adult child's finances. However, the mom's intentions might be to help or monitor, but the method is intrusive. \n\nThe author's reaction is cutting off the mom from the account, which could be a valid step if the mom's monitoring is causing undue stress. But removing someone from a joint account can be seen as abrupt and might hurt the mom's feelings, especially if she was unaware the child resented this. \n\nLegal perspective: A joint account allows both parties access. The author can legally remove the mom, as they are the account owner. However, the emotional impact is significant. The mom might feel neglected or worried, which the author didn't consider. \n\nMoral perspective: The author has the right to privacy and autonomy. The mom's actions, while intended to help, might be controlling. The author's frustration is understandable, but handling it by removing the mom suddenly without discussing could be seen as not considering her feelings.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong in removing the mom from the account. If the mom was prying inappropriately, the author is justified. But if the mom's actions were within reasonable concern, the author might be wrong to cut her off without communication. However, the author did express frustration and took action, which might be justified given the context. \n\nOverall, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they have the right to privacy, but they could have handled it better. However, some might argue they should have discussed it instead of removing her abruptly. But given the mom was already overstepping, the author's action is defensible.\n"
