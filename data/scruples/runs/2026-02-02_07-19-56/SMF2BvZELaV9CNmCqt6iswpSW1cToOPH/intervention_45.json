Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a joint bank account with the mother and the author being upset that the mother checks their spending. The author got angry, told the mom to be removed from the account, and the mom cried. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The account is joint, so both parties have access. The mother's actions of checking the spending could be seen as overstepping, but maybe she's just concerned. The author is an adult, 25, living independently. The mother's behavior might stem from a place of caring, but it's interfering in the author's autonomy.\n\nThe author's reaction was to cut off the joint account, which caused the mom to cry. That's a strong reaction. But the author was also being called multiple times while working, which is stressful. The key points here are the nature of the joint account and the boundaries of privacy.\n\nJoint accounts typically allow both parties to access funds, but does that include monitoring each other's spending? It's common for joint account holders to have some oversight, but constant monitoring and criticism can infringe on personal boundaries. The author might feel that their financial independence is being undermined, especially since they're living on their own now.\n\nThe mother's actions could be seen as controlling, especially given the history of the author moving out due to controlling parents. The author's frustration is understandable. However, ending the joint account abruptly caused emotional harm to the mother. The question is whether the author's actions were justified despite the emotional impact.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author has the right to manage their own finances, but the method of resolving the issue might have been harsh. Perhaps a more constructive approach, like discussing boundaries without removing the mother from the account, could have been better. But given the mother's repeated intrusive behavior and the author's previous need to move out, the author's actions might be seen as necessary for their independence.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a balance between respecting the mother's intentions and the author's need for autonomy. The answer hinges on whether the author's reaction was proportionate. If the mother was indeed overstepping, then the author might not be in the wrong. However, the emotional impact on the mother is a factor. But considering the context of control and the author's need for independence, the answer might lean towards the author being justified. But I need to check if my understanding is correct.\n"
