Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a joint account with their mom since they were young. The mom checks the spending history and comments on the author's spending. The author is now 25, independent, and moved out. The mom's calls about expenses led to the author cutting her off, causing her to cry.\n\nSo, the main points are: joint account history, mom's over-involvement in finances, author's frustration, and the resulting argument. \n\nJoint accounts usually mean both parties have access. The mom might feel she has a right to see the transactions, thinking she's helping. But the author feels their privacy is invaded and wants independence. \n\nIs the author wrong? At 25, they're an adult and have the right to manage their finances without parental interference. The mom's actions might be overstepping, especially if the author is self-sufficient. However, removing someone from a joint account abruptly could be seen as harsh. But given the context of controlling parents and the author trying to become independent, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe mom's crying might stem from feeling rejected or her role as a parent being challenged. But the author has the right to set boundaries. The key is whether the author acted unreasonably. Since the mom was snooping and the author felt it was intrusive, taking her off the account is a reasonable step for autonomy. So the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
