Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a joint bank account between the person and their mom. The mom checks their spending history and calls them about it, which leads to the person ending the joint account and making the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age and independence of the person. They're 25, moved out at 21, and are self-sufficient. At that age, financial independence is usually expected. However, the joint account setup might be part of the issue. If it's a joint account, the mom has access, but the dynamic here seems to be more about control and boundaries.\n\nThe mom's actions: she's checking spending, commenting on their habits, and calling about specific charges. The person feels it's intrusive. The mom might be trying to help, but the approach is causing friction. The person's response was to remove the mom from the account, which led to the mom crying. \n\nIs the person wrong? Well, they have a right to financial privacy, especially as an adult. If the mom is part of a joint account, she might feel entitled to monitor, but the person's reaction to remove her might be justified if they wanted to maintain independence. The mom's repeated calls during work might be overstepping, so the person's anger isn't unfounded. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel she's just looking out for them. But given the person's self-sufficiency and the control issues mentioned earlier (moving out due to controlling parents), ending the joint account makes sense. The answer might lean towards the person not being in the wrong. \n\nSo, probably answer B (No, not in the wrong). They're asserting their independence, which is reasonable. The mom should have respected their boundaries instead of snoop.\n"
