Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, which the author finds intrusive. The mom calls repeatedly about a car insurance charge, leading the author to remove the mom from the account and make her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social norms around joint accounts. Typically, in a joint account, both parties have access to the funds and can see the transactions. So from a legal standpoint, the mom's access isn't necessarily wrong. However, the emotional aspect is important here. The author feels that the mom is overstepping, especially after moving out and being independent. The mom's actions might be\u51fa\u4e8e concern, but it's coming across as intrusive. \n\nThe author's response was to remove the mom from the account, which is a legal right they have as the account holder. But the mom was upset, which makes the user question if the author was in the wrong. \n\nFrom a social perspective, the mom might feel she's just looking out for her child, but the author has established independence. The author's frustration is understandable given the control issues mentioned (moving out due to controlling parents). The mom's repeated calls during work could be seen as overbearing. \n\nThe key points are: joint account access vs. privacy, the author's right to control their finances now that they're independent, and the mom's intentions versus the author's feelings. The author's action was a way to set a boundary, which is reasonable. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), as they are asserting their independence, even if it caused emotional upset. The mom's actions, while well-meaning, encroached on the author's autonomy, which the author is now rejecting.\n"
