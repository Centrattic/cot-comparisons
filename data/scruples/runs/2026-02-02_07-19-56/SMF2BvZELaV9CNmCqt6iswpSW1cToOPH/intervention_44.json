Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account. The author explains that they've had a joint account with their mom since they were younger, which made things easier when they needed money. Now they're 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending history and comments on it, which the author usually ignores. But when the mom called about two car insurance payments, the author got angry, told her to remove herself from the account, and the mom cried.\n\nHmm, the author's side of things is that they feel their mom is invading their privacy by checking their spending. They're an adult now, so they might see this as controlling. The mom's side is that she's only looking out for them, maybe trying to help with financial management. But the author feels it's intrusive and decides to end the joint account, leading to the mom crying. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they did confront the mom angrily and ended the joint account, which caused her emotional distress. But the mom was sifting through their finances, which could be seen as overstepping. The author's anger might be justified if they felt their autonomy was being violated. However, the way they handled it\u2014yelling and cutting off the mom\u2014could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe key points are the mom's intention to help but perhaps being overbearing, and the author's need for financial independence. Ending a joint account is their right, but the method could be more considerate. Maybe the author should have had a calm conversation instead of getting angry. On the other hand, the mom should respect the author's independence now that they're an adult. \n\nI think it's a mix, but since the user is asking for AITA, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author has a right to their privacy and autonomy. However, the way they handled it could be improved. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The mom was being intrusive, so the author's actions, while perhaps not the best method, are not wrong. So answer B.\n"
