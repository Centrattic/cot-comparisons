Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a joint bank account with their mom. They're 25, moved out at 21, and now the mom checks their spending history. The author got upset because the mom called them multiple times about something they saw in the account and then decided to remove the mom from the joint account, causing the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically mean both parties have access. So, the mom can see the transactions, and the author can too. The mom's actions might be coming from a place of concern, especially since they established the joint account when the author was younger. Now that the author is an adult, the mom's continued involvement might feel intrusive. But is that the author's fault?\n\nThe author is self-sufficient now, which is good. But the mom's behavior\u2014calling repeatedly, pointing out expenses\u2014could be seen as overstepping. However, the author's response was to cut off the joint account, leading to emotional distress. The question is whether the author's action was justified or if they overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, the mom's behavior was invasive and possibly controlling, given the author's history of moving out due to controlling parents. The author might feel that their independence is being undermined. On the other hand, removing someone from a joint account without prior discussion could be abrupt. The mom might have expected some communication rather than an immediate cut-off.\n\nThe author did mention they usually shrug off the mom's comments, but this time it escalated. The author's anger and decision to remove the mom might be seen as a reaction to feeling spied on. However, the mom's crying suggests she felt rejected or hurt, which is a natural reaction to being removed from a shared account.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might have a point in feeling that their privacy was invaded, but the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. The right approach might have been to discuss the issue and perhaps transition to a separate account gradually. Removing the mom abruptly might have been the trigger for her emotional response. Therefore, the author's action might be justified as a stand for independence, but the method could be questioned. However, given the context of the mom's controlling behavior in the past, the author's decision to set boundaries is understandable. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were asserting their autonomy.\n"
