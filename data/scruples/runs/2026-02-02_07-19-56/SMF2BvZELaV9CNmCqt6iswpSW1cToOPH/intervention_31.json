Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and now is self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending and calls about it, leading to the author removing her from the account, making the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. When two people are on a joint account, they usually have access to each other's transactions. So the mom seeing the spending history isn't necessarily a violation, but the way she's using it to nag the adult child might be an issue. The author is an adult, so they might feel their autonomy is being invaded. \n\nThe mom's actions\u2014calling multiple times, commenting on spending habits\u2014could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is living independently. The author's frustration is understandable. However, removing the mom from the joint account could be a drastic reaction. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries or having a conversation.\n\nBut the author is now cutting off access, which might be justified if the mom's behavior is controlling. However, causing the mom to cry might indicate that the author didn't consider her feelings, even if they were upset. So there's a balance between personal autonomy and respecting family relationships.\n\nI think the author has a valid reason to want privacy, but the method might have been harsh. Maybe the answer is that the author isn't entirely wrong, but could have handled it better. But according to the options, it's either A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But considering the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their independence. So the answer might be B.\n"
