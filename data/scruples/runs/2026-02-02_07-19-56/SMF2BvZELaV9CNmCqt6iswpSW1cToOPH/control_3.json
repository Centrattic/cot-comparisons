Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation involves a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The mom has been checking the spending history, which the author finds intrusive. Now, the author is cutting her off from the account because they're upset about the calls.\n\nFirst, the joint account aspect. When you have a joint account, both parties typically have access to the funds and the transaction history. So from a legal standpoint, the mom has a right to see the transactions. But the issue here is more about the relationship and boundaries. The author is an adult, 25, living independently, and the mom's constant monitoring is causing tension.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems overbearing. Even if she's trying to help, calling multiple times about minor issues can be seen as controlling. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy. The key point is that the author is self-sufficient now, so the joint account might not be necessary anymore. \n\nThe author's reaction is to remove the mom from the account, which could be seen as a reasonable step to set boundaries. However, the mom cried, indicating emotional harm. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. \n\nThe author isn't necessarily wrong because they're establishing boundaries in a situation where the mom's actions are intrusive. The mom's actions might be well-meaning, but the way she's enforcing it is problematic. The author has the right to control their finances now that they're independent. So the answer is more on the side of the author not being in the wrong. The mom's behavior is the root issue here.\n"
