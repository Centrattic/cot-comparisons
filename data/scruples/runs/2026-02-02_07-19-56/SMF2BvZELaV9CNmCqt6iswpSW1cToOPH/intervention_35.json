Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The mom checks the spending history, calls the author about it, and the author gets angry and removes the mom from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and financial aspects. A joint account usually means both parties have access and can see the transactions. So the mom isn't really invading privacy here; it's part of having a joint account. But the author is an adult, 25, living independently, and might feel that their privacy is being invaded. However, the mom's actions are within her rights as a joint account holder.\n\nEmotionally, the mom might be overstepping if she's being controlling. The author moved out because of controlling parents, so this situation might be triggering that. The author's reaction of getting angry and removing the mom could be seen as cutting off a legitimate access they had. But the mom's constant calls about spending might be too intrusive, even if it's her right.\n\nThe key points are: joint account rights, the mom's concern vs. the author's need for privacy, and the emotional impact. Legally, the mom has the right to access the account. But the author might feel that the mom is being overbearing. The author's decision to remove the mom could be seen as a necessary step to set boundaries, but it caused emotional distress.\n\nI think the answer is a balance. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the method (removing the mom suddenly) might have been harsh. However, since the joint account was part of their agreement from the start, the author might have been in the wrong for not addressing the issue earlier or finding a compromise. Alternatively, the mom's behavior might be overstepping, so the author is justified in ending the joint account. It's a bit of a toss-up between A and B. But considering that joint accounts allow both parties to access, the author's action might be seen as breaking that agreement without prior discussion, so maybe A. But if the mom was being too intrusive, B could be the answer. Hmm.\n"
