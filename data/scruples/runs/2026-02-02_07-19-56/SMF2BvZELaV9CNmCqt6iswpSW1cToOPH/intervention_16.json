Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out when they were 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, which the author usually ignores but got annoyed today when the mom called multiple times about car insurance payments. The author then removes the mom from the joint account, making the mom cry.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically mean both parties have access and control. The mom might feel she has the right to check the spending since it's a joint account. However, the author might feel that their privacy is being invaded, especially since they're adults and self-sufficient. \n\nThe mom's actions could stem from concern, wanting to help or guide her adult child. But the author might see this as overstepping, especially if they've left home and want independence. The conflict here is between parental concern and adult autonomy.\n\nThe author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which might be seen as cutting off a relationship or a financial connection. The mom crying suggests emotional harm. But the author's frustration is understandable if the mom is constantly monitoring and calling about finances without consent.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on the context of the joint account. If the mom was co-signing or the account is for shared expenses, maybe there's a reason for access. But if it's just the author's money and the mom is only there for past convenience, the author might have a right to privacy. However, removing someone from a joint account without discussing could be abrupt. Maybe a better approach would be to talk about boundaries. But the author's right to control their own money is also valid.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They might have the right to their privacy, especially as an adult. The mom's actions might be overbearing. But the way the author handled it could have been smoother. Still, the core issue is about control and privacy in a joint account. The answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
