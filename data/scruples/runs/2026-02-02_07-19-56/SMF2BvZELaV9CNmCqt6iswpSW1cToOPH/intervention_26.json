Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a joint bank account between a 25-year-old and their mother. The mother has been checking the spending history, which the author finds intrusive. The author then decides to remove the mother from the account, leading to the mother crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. Typically, in a joint account, both parties have access and can see transactions. So, the mother's ability to check the spending isn't inherently wrong. However, the author is an adult, living independently, and might see this as an invasion of privacy. But the initial setup of the joint account might have been for convenience when the author was younger. Now that the author is independent, continuing a joint account could be a point of contention.\n\nThe mother's actions\u2014calling multiple times, commenting on spending habits\u2014might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author feels they are being monitored without consent. The key issue is whether the mother's actions are acceptable in a joint account. The author's reaction is to remove the mother from the account, which the mother found upsetting. \n\nThe question is about fault. The author's anger and decision to remove the mother could be seen as a justified response to feeling invaded. However, the mother might not have realized the intrusion, thinking it was her right as a co-owner. The author's right to privacy versus the mother's right as a joint account holder. \n\nIn legal terms, joint account holders can access all information. But emotionally, the author might feel that the mother's actions are controlling. The author's decision to cut off access is their right, but it caused emotional harm. The mother might be in the wrong by not respecting the author's autonomy, but the author's abrupt action without communication also contributes. \n\nThe answer likely depends on cultural expectations and the specific relationship. If the joint account was always intended for the author to have autonomy, the mother's monitoring is the issue. If the account was meant for shared management, the author removing the mother is wrong. Without clear prior agreement, it's ambiguous. However, since the author is an adult and independent, the mother's persistent monitoring is likely overbearing. The author's action is a response to that, so they might not be in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
