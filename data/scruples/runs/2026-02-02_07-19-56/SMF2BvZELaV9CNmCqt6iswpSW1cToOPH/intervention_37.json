Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a joint bank account with their mom. Since they were young, this was set up so the mom could help out when needed. Now the author is 25, moved out, and they're self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, which the author usually ignores. But when the mom called multiple times about a car insurance payment, the author got angry and decided to remove the mom from the account, causing her to cry. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider joint account terms. In a joint account, both parties typically have access to all information, including transaction histories. So, the mom's ability to check the spending isn't inherently wrong from a legal standpoint. But the emotional aspect is different. The mom is overstepping if she's being intrusive or controlling. The author is an adult and independent now, so the mom's constant monitoring might be seen as overbearing.\n\nThe author's reaction was to cut off the joint access, which is a valid step to regain privacy. However, the way they did it\u2014angering and causing the mom to cry\u2014might be seen as harsh. The mom had a right to be concerned, but maybe her approach was too controlling. The author had to set a boundary, which is understandable. But was there a better way to handle it without making the mom cry? Maybe a calm conversation would have been better, but the core issue is the mom's snooping. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mom was being overbearing and the author needed to protect their privacy, then the author isn't wrong. The mom's actions were likely the root of the problem. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
