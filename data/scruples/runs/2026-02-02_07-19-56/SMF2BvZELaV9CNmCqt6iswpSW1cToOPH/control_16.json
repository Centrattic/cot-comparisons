Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks the author's spending, gives comments, and called multiple times about a car insurance charge. The author got angry, removed the mom from the account, and the mom cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of a joint account. In a joint account, both parties typically have access and can see the transactions. The mom might have been involved in managing the account from the start, so when the author becomes an adult and wants more privacy, there's a conflict.\n\nThe author's actions: removing the mom from the account. This is a significant step because it's about control and privacy. The mom's behavior of checking spending and calling repeatedly could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is now independent. However, the mom's intentions are to look out for the author's financial well-being, even if the approach is intrusive.\n\nThe emotional response: the mom cried. This might indicate that she felt hurt or rejected. The author's anger stems from feeling monitored and possibly controlled, which is a common issue in parent-child relationships when the child is trying to establish independence.\n\nLegal and practical aspects: The author has the right to manage their own finances. If it's a joint account, both can access it, but removing a co-owner might require notice or consent depending on the bank's policies, but that's not the focus here. The question is more about moral responsibility.\n\nMoral perspective: The author has a right to privacy, especially after becoming independent. However, the sudden action without perhaps a discussion might have been abrupt. The mom's concern could be genuine, but the method of checking and calling multiple times during work is intrusive. The author's frustration is valid, but handling it by cutting off the mom suddenly might be seen as harsh, leading to emotional harm.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the action of removing the mom was justified given the circumstances. If the mom was being overbearing, the author's decision to take control of their finances is understandable. However, the way it was done (anger) and the resulting emotional distress might make the author partially at fault. Alternatively, the mom's actions were overstepping, so the author is justified.\n\nPossible answer: B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to control their own finances once independent. The mom's behavior was intrusive, and removing her from the account is a reasonable step to maintain privacy. However, handling it calmly and discussing it first might have been better to avoid hurt feelings. But given the context, the author's actions are justified.\n"
