Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for making their mom cry by removing her from their joint bank account. They've been in a joint account since they had a bank account, which was set up when they were a kid. Now they're 25, moved out, and self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending history and comments on it, which they usually ignore. But when she called multiple times about a car insurance payment issue, they got angry and removed her from the account, leading her to cry.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. The joint account was originally for convenience when the person was younger. Now that they're an adult and independent, the mom is still monitoring their spending. The person feels that this is an invasion of privacy, especially since they're responsible for their own finances now. The mom's actions might come from a place of concern, but the person is frustrated because they don't want her to snoop. When the mom called repeatedly during work, the person snapped and removed her from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nIs the person in the wrong? Well, they are an adult and have the right to manage their own finances. The joint account was set up when they were a minor or dependent, but now they're living independently. It's reasonable for them to want privacy in their financial matters. The mom's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, might be overstepping. The person had the right to change the account terms since it's their account now. However, the way they handled it, by removing the mom suddenly and causing her to cry, might have been harsh. But considering the context of being called multiple times about something they already knew about, the person's frustration is understandable. So, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to their financial privacy. The answer is B.\n"
