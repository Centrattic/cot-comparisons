Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 25, moved out at 21 because their parents were controlling. They've been self-sufficient since then. The joint account with their mom was useful when they were younger, but now the mom checks their spending history and comments on it. The mom calls them at work because she noticed two car insurance payments close together. The author gets angry, ends the joint account, and the mom cries.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they might feel that their privacy is being invaded. They are an adult, so they might expect some autonomy. The mom, on the other hand, is concerned and maybe overstepping by checking their spending. The author ending the joint account is a way to set a boundary, which could be seen as necessary for their independence.\n\nHowever, the mom's actions might stem from genuine concern, even if it's intrusive. The author's response was to cut her off, which led to the mom crying. The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. If the joint account was part of a family tradition or if the mom was helping with finances, then maybe ending it suddenly is harsh. But the author mentions they're self-sufficient now, so maybe they don't need the joint account anymore. Also, being called multiple times at work for something the author already knew about (duplicate payments) might have been frustrating. The mom's snooping could feel disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't give the mom a chance to explain her concern or address it calmly. Ending the joint account was a drastic step without prior communication. The mom's crying indicates she felt hurt, which the author might have caused unintentionally.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They have a right to privacy and financial independence, but cutting off the mom abruptly without discussion might have been harsh. The mom might have been trying to help, even if in an intrusive way. The author could have communicated their desire for privacy without removing the mom from the account immediately. Therefore, maybe the author is partially at fault for not handling it more sensitively, but also the mom's actions were overstepping. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the context of moving out and self-sufficiency, the author's decision to set a boundary is understandable. The answer might lean towards B, not the author's fault. But there's nuance here. The key is that the author had valid reasons for privacy and the mom's actions were intrusive, so the author's action of removing the mom might be justified. So, answer B.\n"
