Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a joint bank account with their mom. They've been living on their own since 25, moved out at 21 because of controlling parents. Now they're handling their own finances, but their mom keeps checking their spending and calling them about it. The author got angry and removed their mom from the joint account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The mom might feel she's looking out for her child's financial well-being, especially since they had a controlling upbringing. Maybe she's worried about their financial habits and wants to ensure they're making smart decisions. However, the author is an adult, 25 years old, and has been self-sufficient since moving out. Being in a joint account means both have access to each other's financial info, but the author might feel their privacy is being invaded. \n\nThe mom's actions of checking spending and calling multiple times could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author is managing their own money now. The fact that the author had to take her off the account suggests that the mom's involvement was causing stress and conflict. However, the mom crying indicates she felt hurt, possibly thinking her concern was unwelcome.\n\nThe author's anger at being called about their spending might be justified if they feel their autonomy is being violated. But ending the joint account without discussing it first could be seen as abrupt. Maybe a better approach would have been to have a conversation about boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong because they're asserting their independence, but the way they handled it could have been more considerate.\n\nOn the flip side, the mom might have overstepped by sifting through the finances too much, not respecting the adult child's independence. The author's decision to remove her from the account is a way to set a boundary, which is their right as an adult. However, the emotional impact of making her cry could be seen as a consequence of not handling the situation more carefully.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom's behavior might have been intrusive, and the author's response, while causing hurt feelings, was about asserting control over their own finances. The key point is whether the mom had a right to access the account and comment on the spending given that it's a joint account. If the account was meant for mutual access, maybe the author should have discussed removing her rather than doing it abruptly. But since the author is self-sufficient, they might not need the joint account anymore, making the removal a reasonable action.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they are setting boundaries after years of controlling behavior from their parents. The mom's actions were overstepping, and the author's response was to take control of their financial privacy. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
