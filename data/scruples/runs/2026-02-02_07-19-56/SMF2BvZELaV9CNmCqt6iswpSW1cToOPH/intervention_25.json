Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account. The scenario involves a joint account between the author and their mom. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, leading to the author cutting her off, which made the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the joint account. Joint accounts typically mean both parties have access and control. The mom's actions of checking the spending could be seen as part of her role in managing the account. However, the author is now 25, independent, and moved out. The mom's interference might be overstepping, especially if the author feels their privacy is invaded.\n\nThe mom's intentions might be to help, but her methods\u2014like calling multiple times during work\u2014could be seen as controlling. The author's reaction is anger and cutting off the mom, which led to emotional distress. The key here is whether the author's actions were justified. Ending a joint account is a significant step and can have financial implications. If the mom didn't agree to this, it could be a breach of trust or agreement, making the author at fault. However, if the mom was continuously overstepping and the author felt it necessary to protect their autonomy, the author might not be wrong. \n\nBut since joint account decisions usually require mutual agreement, the author acting unilaterally without discussing might be in the wrong. The mom's actions, while intrusive, might stem from concern, but the author's method of stopping the joint access without prior communication could be harsh. So, the author's actions might have been impulsive, leading to the mom's emotional reaction. Therefore, the author is at fault for not addressing the issue calmly and possibly breaking the joint account without considering the mom's perspective.\n"
