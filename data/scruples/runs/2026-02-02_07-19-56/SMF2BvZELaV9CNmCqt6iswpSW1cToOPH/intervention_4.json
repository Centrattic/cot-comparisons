Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from the joint account. \n\nFirst, the situation involves a joint bank account between the author and their mom. When the author was younger, this setup was helpful because the mom could add money as needed. Now that the author is 25, moved out, and self-sufficient, the mom checks the spending history and comments on it. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy because they're adults and want independence. The conflict escalated when the mom called repeatedly about a car insurance charge, leading the author to remove her from the account, which made her cry.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n- The joint account was originally for convenience when the author was younger.\n- Now, the author is independent but the mom still checks spending, possibly out of concern.\n- The author feels it's intrusive and removes the mom, causing her to cry.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The mom might see the joint account as a way to help and monitor, thinking she's looking out for her child. However, the author is an adult and might feel that their privacy is being invaded. Removing the mom from the account could be seen as a justified action to regain control over their finances, especially if the mom's actions were causing stress.\n\nBut why did the author think they were in the wrong? Maybe because cutting off the mom abruptly without discussing it first might be seen as harsh. However, if the author tried to handle it calmly and the mom didn't respect their boundaries, then the author might not be wrong. \n\nThe mom crying might indicate that her actions were causing emotional distress, but the author's actions also caused her distress. It's a bit of a tough call. Legally, both can access a joint account, so the author has the right to remove someone. Emotionally, though, the mom might feel hurt because she was trying to help. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author felt the need to set boundaries for their mental health and independence, then it's understandable. However, perhaps a better approach would have been to communicate the need for privacy first rather than removing the mom suddenly. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the best approach.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were a reasonable way to assert independence or if they overreacted. Since the author was self-sufficient and the mom's actions were intrusive, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the method of removing the mom without discussion could be seen as harsh. But given the context of controlling parents and the author's need for autonomy, it's a valid boundary. So probably answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
