Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about their mom having access to their joint bank account and checking their spending, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The person is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. The joint account was set up when they were younger for convenience, but now the mom is frequently checking their spending and calling them about it. The person got angry and removed their mom from the account, which made her cry. The question is whether the person is at fault.\n\nHmm. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong. Let's break it down. When you have a joint account, both parties have access to the information, right? But the issue here is the mom's behavior\u2014calling repeatedly about the spending. The person feels it's an invasion of privacy, especially since they are adults and self-sufficient. \n\nThe mom's actions could be seen as overstepping. Even if her intention is to look out for her child, constant checking and calling might not be appropriate once the child is independent. The person had the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel their privacy is being violated. Removing the mom from the joint account seems like a reasonable step to regain control over their finances. \n\nBut then there's the emotional reaction\u2014the mom cried. That might make some people think the person was too harsh. However, the mom initiated the situation by snooping and intruding into her adult child's financial matters. The person had a right to be upset and take action to protect their privacy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, joint accounts usually mean both parties can access the funds, but the dynamics here were set up when the person was younger. Now that they're an adult, continuing the joint account might not be necessary. The person's decision to remove the mom could be seen as a necessary step for their autonomy. \n\nSo, considering the control aspect and the mom's overstepping, the person isn't in the wrong. They were asserting their independence and right to privacy. The answer would be B (No).\n"
