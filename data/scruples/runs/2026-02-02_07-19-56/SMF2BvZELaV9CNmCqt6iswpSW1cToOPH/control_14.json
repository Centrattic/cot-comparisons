Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a joint bank account with their mom, who checks their spending. The author got angry and cut off the mom, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider joint account dynamics. When an account is joint, both parties usually have access to the account details. So maybe the mom's checking the spending isn't inherently wrong. But the author moved out and became independent, so maybe they wanted more privacy.\n\nThe mom's actions: she's giving feedback on spending, which could be seen as concern, but maybe it's overstepping. The author felt it was intrusive, especially when the mom called repeatedly while they were working. The author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which led to emotional distress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, joint accounts mean both have access. Removing the other person without discussing might be abrupt. But the mom's actions might have crossed a boundary. However, the author's response of cutting off the mom suddenly could be seen as harsh, especially causing her to cry. There's a balance between privacy and family dynamics here. The author's independence is understandable, but the way they handled it might have been too harsh. So maybe they're partially at fault. But the mom's snooping could also be an issue. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mom had a right to access as a joint account holder, then removing her without discussion might be wrong. But if the author felt their privacy was violated, maybe they have a point. I think the answer leans towards the author not being entirely wrong because they had the right to set boundaries, but perhaps they could have handled it more sensitively. So maybe answer B, not in the wrong.\n"
