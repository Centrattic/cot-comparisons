Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from the joint account.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has a joint bank account with their mom. They moved out and became self-sufficient at 25. The mom checks their spending and comments on it, which the author finds intrusive. The author got angry when the mom called about a car insurance payment and decided to remove her from the account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the joint account and the dynamics between the author and their mom. Joint accounts typically mean both parties have access and control. The mom's actions of checking the spending and commenting on it might be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is an adult and self-sufficient now. However, the mom might believe she's just looking out for her child's financial well-being.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. Being called multiple times while at work about something that might be a mistake (like duplicate insurance payments) could be stressful. The author's decision to remove the mom from the account is a way to set a boundary. But did that action make them wrong?\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, removing someone from a joint account can be abrupt and might not allow for open communication. However, if the author felt that their privacy was being invaded, especially after moving out and establishing independence, it's a valid concern. The mom's behavior might be overbearing, especially if it's constant and critical.\n\nThe emotional impact on the mom is significant since she cried. But the author might feel that their autonomy is being respected by ending the joint account. It's a delicate balance between respecting parental concern and adult independence. \n\nIn many cases, open communication is key. The author might have handled it differently by discussing the issue first, but the action of removing the mom could be seen as necessary to set a boundary. Whether it's right or wrong depends on the context of their relationship and the mom's intentions. However, the author is an adult, so the decision to manage their own finances independently is a reasonable step. The mom's intrusion might have crossed a line, making the author justified in their action. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
