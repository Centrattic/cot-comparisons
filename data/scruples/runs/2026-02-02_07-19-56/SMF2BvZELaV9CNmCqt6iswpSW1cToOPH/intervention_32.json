Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is about a joint bank account between the author (25 years old) and their mom. They moved out at 21 and are now self-sufficient. The mom checks their spending and calls them about it, leading to the author removing her from the joint account, making the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The account was originally set up for the author's benefit when they were younger, but now they're an adult. Keeping a joint account might not be necessary once the child is independent. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is self-sufficient. However, the mom might feel she's looking out for them, which is a common parent concern.\n\nThe author got angry when the mom called repeatedly about a car insurance issue. Removing the mom from the account caused emotional distress. The question is whether the author overreacted. On one hand, the mom had access to the account without consent, which is a privacy issue. On the other, the author could have handled the situation more calmly, maybe by discussing the account setup instead of abruptly removing her, leading to emotional harm.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key points are respect and communication. The author might be justified in wanting privacy, but the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. The mom's actions are intrusive, but the author's response was abrupt. The answer depends on whether the removal was a reasonable boundary or an overreaction. Given that the author is an adult and the mom was snooping, the author might not be in the wrong, but the method could be questioned. However, the AITA context often emphasizes minimizing harm. The mom was crying, so maybe the author could have approached it more sensitively. But the core issue is the mom's invasion of privacy. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but with nuance.\n"
