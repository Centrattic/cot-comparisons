Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a joint bank account with their mom. The user is 25, moved out at 21, and became self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history, comments on the spending, and calls about discrepancies. The user got angry and removed the mom from the account, leading the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically allow both parties access and control, so the mom's actions might be within her rights. However, the user feels this is intrusive. The mom is acting out of concern, but her snooping and constant calls could be overstepping. The user's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which might be a valid step if they wanted financial independence. But the mom's emotional response suggests that her actions were a form of care, even if it was intrusive.\n\nThe user's anger might be justified if they felt their autonomy was being violated, especially after moving out and becoming independent. However, the way they handled it (angrily removing the mom) might have been abrupt and contributed to the mom's distress. The key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The mom's concern is understandable, but she might need to respect the user's independence. The user's decision to end the joint account could be necessary for their autonomy, but the method might have been harsh. It's a bit of a gray area, but the user's actions were likely a response to ongoing issues, so maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. However, their approach could have been more considerate. I'm leaning towards the user not being in the wrong because they took a stand for their independence, even if the execution could be smoother. So answer B.\n"
