Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong (AITA) for making their mom cry because she checks their spending history. The situation involves a joint bank account with the mom, who's been monitoring their finances since they had a bank account. The person is 25, moved out, and is now self-sufficient but the mom still checks their spending, which has led to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The account is joint, so both parties have access to each other's finances. The mom's actions might be coming from a place of concern, wanting to ensure her adult child isn't overspending. However, the person feels that this monitoring is intrusive, especially since they are now independent. The key points here are autonomy versus parental concern.\n\nThe person moved out at 21 because of controlling parents. That suggests that the mom's behavior might be overstepping boundaries even before. Now that they're 25 and living independently, the expectation of financial privacy might be higher. The mom still continues to check and comment on their spending, which the person finds annoying and controlling. The incident that triggered the conflict was the mom calling multiple times about a car insurance payment, leading the person to remove the mom from the joint account.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, joint account holders can indeed monitor each other's transactions, but emotionally, it's different. The person might be justified in feeling that their mom is overstepping, especially if they've established independence. However, the mom might genuinely care and not realize that her actions are causing distress. The person's response was to remove the mom from the account, which ended in the mom crying. \n\nIs the person in the wrong for removing the mom from the account? It's a joint account, so both have the right to manage it. The person might be within their rights to remove the mom, but the emotional impact is significant. The question is whether their actions were justified. \n\nOn one hand, the mom's actions could be seen as overbearing and not respecting the adult child's autonomy. On the other hand, the mom might see it as her duty to care for her child financially. The person's frustration is valid if they feel their privacy is violated. However, reacting angrily and removing the mom without a discussion could be seen as abrupt. \n\nBut considering the context of the parents being controlling in the past, the person might have a legitimate reason to want to set boundaries. The mom's actions could be seen as not respecting the adult child's independence. So the person is not in the wrong for asserting their privacy and removing the mom from the account, even if it caused emotional distress. The mom might need to adjust her behavior to respect the adult child's autonomy.\n"
