Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 25-year-old who moved out at 21 and is now dealing with their mother having access to their joint bank account. The mother checks the spending history and calls the author about expenses, leading to the author cutting her off and making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is an adult, living independently, and might feel their financial privacy is being invaded. The mother, on the other hand, might see her checking as a way to help or protect her child. But the author is self-sufficient now, so maybe the joint account isn't necessary anymore.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. When they were younger, a joint account made sense for convenience. But at 25, the author might need their own financial independence. The mother's actions of constantly monitoring and calling about expenses could be seen as overstepping, especially since the author is capable of managing their finances. The author's frustration leading to removing the mother from the account is a reaction to this invasion of privacy. \n\nHowever, the mother's intention might be to help, but her methods are intrusive. The author has the right to their privacy once they're adults. Ending the joint account is a reasonable step to set boundaries. But did they handle it in a considerate way? The author was angry and cut things off abruptly, which caused the mother to cry. Maybe a more respectful conversation could have been better, but the core issue is about the joint account's necessity. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting their independence. The mother might be overstepping by continuing to monitor an adult child's finances without consent. The joint account was a past arrangement that might not fit the current situation. So the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
