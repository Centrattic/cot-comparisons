Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a joint account with their mom since they were younger. Now that they're 25 and living independently, the mom checks their spending, which the author finds intrusive. The mom calls multiple times to question a car insurance payment, leading the author to remove her from the account, making her cry.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. A joint account typically means both parties have access and control. However, when the author moved out and became self-sufficient, the dynamic might have changed. The mom's actions, while intended to help, might be seen as overstepping, especially if she's accessing the account without consent. \n\nBut removing someone from a joint account is a significant action. If the account was originally joint with mutual agreement, the author might have the right to change that, but it's possible the mom expected continued joint access. The author's anger and the way they handled it could have been insensitive, but the mom's repeated calls during work might have been stressful. \n\nThe author's justification is about needing control over their finances now that they're independent. However, cutting off the mom abruptly without a discussion could be seen as harsh. The mom's emotional reaction suggests she felt hurt or betrayed. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they have a right to their financial independence. On the other, the way they handled it might have caused unnecessary hurt. The mom's actions might be overbearing, but the author's response was abrupt. It's a balance between respecting boundaries and communication. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because they have the right to manage their own finances. But maybe they could have handled it better by discussing the issue instead of removing her suddenly. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they took action without prior communication, maybe they are partially at fault. But the situation is complex. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe A if the removal was without discussion. Hmm.\n"
