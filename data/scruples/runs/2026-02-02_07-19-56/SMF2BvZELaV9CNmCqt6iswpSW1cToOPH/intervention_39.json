Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a situation where the person is upset because their mom is checking their spending through a joint bank account. The mom calls them multiple times about expenses, which the author finds intrusive and decides to remove her from the account, making the mom cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider joint account dynamics. In a joint account, both parties have access, so technically the mom isn't doing anything wrong by checking the transactions. The author might feel their privacy is invaded, but legally, the mom has the right to see the account details. \n\nThe author is 25, living independently, and self-sufficient. They might feel that their mom overstepping by monitoring their spending, especially since they\u2019re no longer a child. However, the mom's intentions could be protective, thinking she's helping her adult child manage money. \n\nEmotionally, the author's reaction is understandable. Being called multiple times while working could be stressful. Removing the mom from the account was a way to set boundaries, but it led to the mom crying. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on their mom, especially if the mom was genuinely concerned and used to managing the account together.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a valid reason to remove the mom from the account. If the mom's actions were causing stress and the author needed personal space, then maybe the action was justified. However, the way it was handled\u2014without perhaps discussing the issue first\u2014could be seen as abrupt and hurtful. The mom might have felt rejected or worried about being excluded from something she was used to handling.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The author's autonomy is important, and setting boundaries is reasonable. However, the execution without communication might have been harsh. The mom's actions, while overbearing, might stem from concern. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit nuanced. If the author had a history of issues with controlling parents, their reaction makes sense. But the sudden removal without addressing the mom's concerns could have been handled better. \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the mom was acting within her rights as a joint account holder, but the author had a right to their privacy, the answer might be B (No). But if the author didn't handle it respectfully, maybe A. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B because the author has the right to control their financial privacy now, especially after moving out and being self-sufficient. The mom's actions were intrusive, so removing her from the account was a way to set boundaries. The crying is a result of emotional impact but not necessarily making the author wrong. So, answer B.\n"
