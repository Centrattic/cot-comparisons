Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a joint bank account between the person and their mom. The person is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. Their mom checks their spending, which they find intrusive. The mom called them multiple times about a car insurance payment, leading the person to remove the mom from the joint account, causing the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup of a joint account. Typically, in a joint account, both parties have access to the funds and can monitor transactions. So the mom's access is not inherently wrong. However, the person feels it's an invasion of privacy. The key points here are the mom's intent and the person's right to privacy once they are independent.\n\nThe person is self-sufficient, which suggests they should have financial independence. The mom's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, might be overstepping now that the person is an adult and living independently. The repeated calls about spending could be seen as controlling or intrusive. The person removing the mom from the account is a response to this perceived intrusion.\n\nHowever, the mom's perspective might be that she's still looking out for her child's financial well-being. There's a cultural context to consider\u2014some families maintain joint accounts for support, but boundaries can blur. The person's reaction (getting angry and removing the mom) might be seen as justified if they feel their privacy is being violated. \n\nBut is the person in the wrong? If the account was joint by agreement, both parties have the right to see the transactions. The problem arises from how the mom uses that information to intrude on the person's autonomy. The person's action of removing the mom could be seen as protecting their privacy, especially since they are adults. However, it might have been better to address the issue calmly first. The mom's crying suggests the action hurt her feelings, which could imply that the person didn't consider her perspective, even if the mom's behavior was overstepping.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mom might need to adjust her behavior, but the person's abrupt action without prior discussion might have been harsh. However, given the context of controlling parents and the person's need for independence, the person's action might be justified. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the person is asserting their independence, but there's a nuance. The key is whether the joint account was still necessary. If the person wanted privacy, removing the mom is a valid step, even if it hurt the mom's feelings. The mom's actions were overbearing, so the person isn't wrong for setting boundaries.\n"
