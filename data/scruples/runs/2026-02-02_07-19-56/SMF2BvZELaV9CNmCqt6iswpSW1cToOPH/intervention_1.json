Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a joint bank account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history and comments on it, leading to the author getting upset and removing the mom from the joint account, causing the mom to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial setup. The account was joint since the author was a child, which was practical for the parents to manage money when the author was younger. Now that the author is an adult and independent, the mom's continued access might be an issue of privacy.\n\nThe mom's actions could be seen as overstepping. Even if she's trying to help, repeatedly checking and commenting on the spending might be invasive. The author feels it's an invasion of privacy, especially when the mom calls multiple times about minor issues. The author's reaction\u2014removing the mom from the account\u2014might be seen as a way to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel entitled to be in the account, especially if they had a long-standing arrangement. However, the author is now independent and has the right to privacy. The mom's calls during work time could be considered disrespectful, adding to the author's frustration.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The joint account was set up when the author was a minor, but now the author is an adult. The author has the right to manage their own finances without unwanted interference. The mom's actions might be well-intentioned, but they infringe on the author's autonomy. Therefore, the author acting to remove the mom to establish boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. The mom's emotional reaction is unfortunate, but the author's right to privacy and independence is a valid reason for the action taken.\n"
