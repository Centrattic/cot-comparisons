Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having a joint bank account with their mom since they were young. Now that the author is 25 and independent, their mom is checking their spending, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the elements of a joint account. When two people have a joint account, both have the right to access and monitor the account's transactions. That's a legal fact. So the mom isn't necessarily violating any rules by checking the spending history. However, the emotional aspect is important here. The author feels their privacy is being invaded, especially since they've moved out and are self-sufficient.\n\nThe mom's actions might stem from concern, given that they've shared the account for a long time. She might see it as her role to look out for her son. But the author is now an adult and might feel that their financial independence is being undermined. The key conflict is between the mom's right to access the account and the author's need for privacy as an adult.\n\nThe author did take the mom off the joint account, which resolved the immediate issue but caused emotional distress. Taking someone off a joint account without prior discussion could be seen as abrupt. The author didn't try to negotiate or set boundaries first, leading to the mom crying. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, both have valid points. The mom isn't wrong for checking the account, and the author isn't wrong for wanting privacy. However, the author's reaction\u2014removing the mom without discussing it first\u2014might be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether the author handled the situation correctly. \n\nConsidering that the author was upset and took a drastic action without communication, it might have been better to talk things out before ending the joint account. The mom's emotional response suggests she felt hurt or surprised by the decision. So, while the author's intent was to protect their privacy, the method could be faulted for being abrupt and causing emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has every right to manage their finances independently now. The joint account setup might not be suitable anymore given their life changes. The mom's constant monitoring could be overstepping, even if her intentions are good. \n\nIn summary, the author isn't inherently wrong for wanting privacy, but the way they addressed the issue could be seen as hasty. The mom isn't wrong for checking the account either. The conflict arises from differing expectations around joint accounts as the dynamics between parent and adult child evolve. So, the answer might hinge on whether the author handled the situation with enough communication and sensitivity.\n"
