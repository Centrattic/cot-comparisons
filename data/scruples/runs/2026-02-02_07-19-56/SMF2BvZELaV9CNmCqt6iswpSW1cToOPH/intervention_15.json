Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after telling her to be removed from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom. The author, now 25 and independent, feels that their mom is overstepping by checking their spending and calling them about it. The mom's actions included calling multiple times to question expenses, leading to the author cutting her off and causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the joint account aspect. When an account is joint, both parties have access to the funds and transaction histories. This is a legal and financial arrangement where both people have equal rights and responsibilities. So, the mom's ability to check the spending is technically within her rights as a joint account holder. However, the emotional aspect here is important. The author feels that their privacy is being invaded, while the mom is trying to look out for them, albeit in a controlling way.\n\nThe author's decision to remove the mom from the account was a way to set a boundary. The mom's reaction (crying) shows that the action hurt her feelings. But is the author in the wrong? Well, the author has the right to manage their own finances and may feel that the joint account was no longer necessary since they are independent. However, the mom might have had the account for a genuine reason, like being able to support her son if needed. \n\nThe key points here are the rights and responsibilities of joint account holders. The author might have a valid point in wanting privacy, but removing the mom without discussing it could have been handled more sensitively. The question of whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of the joint account. Since both parties have rights, but the author acted unilaterally, causing emotional distress, there might be some fault there. However, if the mom was indeed overstepping and the author needed to set boundaries, then the action could be justified. It's a balance between financial rights and familial relationships.\n"
