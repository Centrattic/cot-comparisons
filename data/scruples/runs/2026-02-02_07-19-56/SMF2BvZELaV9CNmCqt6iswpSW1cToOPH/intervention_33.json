Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for making their mom cry by removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mother. The author is 25, moved out independently, and has been self-sufficient. The mother frequently checks the author's spending and comments on it, which the author usually ignores but sometimes gets annoyed by. The conflict peaks when the mother calls multiple times about two car insurance payments, leading the author to remove the mother from the joint account, causing the mother to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects of joint accounts. In a joint account, both parties typically have equal access and the right to monitor transactions. However, the author might feel that their privacy is being invaded, especially since they are an adult living independently. The mother, on the other hand, might believe she's acting out of concern, given the joint account setup.\n\nLegally, removing someone from a joint account without notice could be problematic. If the account is jointly owned, both parties have the right to manage it. However, in practice, one person can change the account to their sole name, but this might depend on the bank's policies and any agreements between the parties. Ethically, the situation is more nuanced. The author might feel their autonomy is being respected, but the mother might feel betrayed or neglected.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014removing the mother from the account without discussion\u2014could be seen as abrupt. Ending a relationship with a parent over financial privacy might be harsh, especially if the mother's actions are driven by concern rather than control. However, the author's right to privacy and financial independence is also important. The mother's constant monitoring and unsolicited advice could be overstepping, especially since the author is an adult and self-sufficient.\n\nThe key points are the mother's controlling behavior versus the author's right to autonomy. The author's decision to cut off the joint account might be a necessary step for their independence, but the method (removing the mother without explanation) could be seen as causing emotional harm. The mother's crying suggests she felt hurt or rejected, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nIn terms of blame, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might have a valid reason to want privacy, but the way they handled it could have been more considerate. The mother's behavior, while possibly well-intentioned, might have crossed into overstepping. However, the author's decision to end the joint account abruptly without addressing the underlying issues might have been too harsh. So, is the author at fault? They might not be entirely wrong, but their approach could have been better. The mother's actions also have issues. The answer hinges on whether the author's right to privacy outweighs the mother's concern, and whether the author's method was appropriate.\n"
