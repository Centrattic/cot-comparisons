Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by removing their mom from a joint bank account, which led to the mom crying. The situation involves a joint account between a 25-year-old and their mother. The key points here are the joint account setup, the mother checking the spending history, and the conflict that arose when the author decided to remove the mom from the account.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically allow both parties to have access to and control over the account. That means either party can make transactions, check balances, and so on. The author mentions that they've been self-sufficient since moving out, but the joint account might be a remnant from when they were younger. The mother's checking the spending history isn't illegal or unethical since it's a joint account. However, the author feels that the mother's actions are intrusive and controlling, leading to the decision to remove the mother from the account, which upset the mother.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014removing their mom from the account\u2014could be seen as a way to set boundaries, especially if the mother's monitoring was causing stress. However, joint accounts are meant for shared access, so removing someone without prior discussion might come across as abrupt. The mother's emotional reaction (crying) suggests that this action had a significant impact on her. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to manage their account as they see fit. If the joint account was no longer serving its original purpose (support for a minor), changing it might be necessary. But the method\u2014removing the mother without discussion\u2014could be problematic. The author could have tried to communicate their need for privacy first instead of immediately removing access. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting privacy, but the way they handled it (without discussing with their mom first) might be where the fault lies. The question is whether the act of removing someone from a joint account without discussion is wrong. If the joint account was agreed upon, both parties have rights. So, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their intentions earlier. Alternatively, if the joint account was causing issues and the author needed to take control of their finances, removing the mother could be justified. \n\nBut given that the mother was a co-owner, the author had the legal right to make that change. However, emotionally, it's hurtful to the mother. The key is intent. If the author's intent was to stop the mother from monitoring, which was causing them stress, then it's a personal decision. But the mother's reaction indicates that she might not have been aware of the change until it happened. So, the author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to manage their account, but they could have handled it more sensitively by discussing it first. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether removing a co-owner from a joint account without prior discussion is considered wrong. Legally, they can do that, but ethically, it's a gray area. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
