Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for making their mom cry by removing her from the joint bank account after she snoops on their spending. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and their mom have a joint account. The author moved out at 21, is now 25, and has been self-sufficient. The mom frequently comments on their spending, calls about specific expenses, and the author got angry and removed the mom from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mom's actions of monitoring the spending might come off as intrusive. The author feels that their privacy is invaded, especially since they're independent now. Removing a parent from a joint account can be seen as cutting them off, which might be justified if the parent is being overbearing. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might have a legitimate concern for her child's financial well-being, especially if they were used to a joint account. The sudden removal could hurt her feelings, as parents often worry about their children's stability. \n\nThe key points are the author's right to financial independence vs. the mom's concern. The author has the right to manage their own finances, especially after moving out and being independent. The mom's behavior could be overstepping, especially if it's persistent and intrusive. The author's decision to remove the mom from the account is a boundary-setting action, which is reasonable if the mom's actions are harmful. However, the way it was handled\u2014anger and removing the mom without prior communication\u2014might have been abrupt. \n\nBut considering the context of the author being in a controlling environment previously, their reaction is understandable. The mom's crying could be due to hurt feelings rather than a valid grievance. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are asserting their independence. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to privacy and financial independence. The mom's actions were intrusive, and the author's response, while causing emotional distress, is a valid boundary.\n"
