Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for making their mom cry after cutting her off from their joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom, which has been in place since the author had their own bank account. Now that the author is 25, living independently, and self-sufficient, the mom is checking the spending history and making comments about it. The author got upset when the mom called multiple times about a car insurance issue and decided to remove her from the account, leading to the mom crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and emotional aspects. Legally, a joint account means both parties have equal access and rights. So, the mom's access isn't inherently wrong. However, the dynamic here is more about control and independence. The author moved out to escape controlling parents, which sets the context. The mom's actions of checking the spending might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author feels it's intrusive. But the mom's intention is to look out for the author, which adds a layer of concern rather than malice.\n\nThe author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account and express anger, leading to emotional distress. The key points here are the author's need for autonomy versus the mom's concern. The author might feel that their financial independence is being undermined, while the mom might feel she's being excluded from a role she's taken on as a caretaker.\n\nI need to evaluate whether the author's actions were justified. Removing someone from a joint account is a significant step, especially if the arrangement was agreed upon long-term. However, the author's circumstances have changed\u2014they're now independent and possibly ready for full control over their finances. The mom's continued interference, even with good intentions, might be crossing a boundary.\n\nBut then again, the author's response was abrupt and might have been done without considering the mom's feelings. The fact that the mom cried suggests she felt hurt or rejected. The author might have handled the situation better by discussing the need for privacy and control rather than cutting her off suddenly. However, the core issue is about the author's right to financial independence versus the mom's overprotectiveness.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a right to control their own finances as an adult. The mom's actions, while well-meaning, could be overstepping. But the way the author handled the situation\u2014angrily cutting the mom off\u2014might have been harsh. So, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the main conflict is the mom's access to the account and the author's need to establish boundaries. The author's autonomy is a strong point, but the emotional impact on the mom is significant.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were a reasonable assertion of independence or an overreaction. The author's justification for moving out due to controlling parents supports their stance, but the sudden removal of the mom without discussion could be seen as harsh. However, given the context, the author is likely in the right because they're asserting their independence. The mom's continued monitoring without consent is an issue, so the author's decision to end the joint account is justified. The fault might lie more with the mom's actions than the author's response.\n"
