Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after ending a joint bank account.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author and their mom have a joint account. The mom checks the spending history, comments on it, and calls the author about expenses. The author feels it's intrusive and ends the joint account, leading to the mom crying.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: They moved out, are self-sufficient, and want privacy. Being called multiple times while working about their spending is frustrating. Ending the joint account is their way to set boundaries.\n\nFrom the mom's perspective: She's concerned, maybe overbearing, but acting out of care. The joint account might be a point of control or concern for her. The sudden removal and emotional reaction could feel hurtful.\n\nKey points: The joint account's setup implies shared access. The mom's actions, while controlling, might stem from worry. The author's response was cutting off access, which could be seen as justified if they needed independence, but the way it was handled might have caused hurt feelings.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on intent and how the situation was handled. Ending the joint account is a reasonable step if the author wanted privacy, but doing it abruptly without explanation might have contributed to the mom's emotional reaction. However, the mom's repeated calls and intrusion could also be problematic.\n\nBalancing both perspectives: The author's right to privacy and independence vs. the mom's concern. The author's action was to protect their autonomy, but the method might have been harsh. However, given the context of controlling parents and the author's efforts to be self-sufficient, the author's stance is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The answer would be B (No).\n"
