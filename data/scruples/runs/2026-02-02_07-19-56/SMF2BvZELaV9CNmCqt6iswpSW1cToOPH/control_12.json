Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a joint bank account with their mom. The user is 25, moved out at 21, and has been self-sufficient. The mom checks the spending history, comments on it, and calls about things like extra charges. The user got angry and removed the mom from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of the joint account. Typically, joint accounts mean both parties have access and can see the transactions. So maybe the mom's actions aren't entirely wrong because she has the right to see the account details. However, the user is an adult and now self-sufficient, so maybe the joint account is outdated. \n\nThe user moved out and established independence, so the mom's continued monitoring might be seen as overstepping. The user's frustration makes sense because privacy is important, especially when you're an adult. The mom might have good intentions, but the way she's approaching it\u2014calling multiple times during work and prying into spending\u2014could be intrusive.\n\nThe user's reaction was to remove the mom from the account. That's a significant action, but considering the mom had been making them uncomfortable for some time, maybe it's justified. The mom's crying might be due to feeling rejected, but the user's right to privacy and financial autonomy is also valid. \n\nI should check if there's any fault on the user's side. The user didn't ask the mom before removing her, which could be abrupt. However, given the context of ongoing issues, the user might have felt it was necessary. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for prioritizing their privacy over the mom's intentions. \n\nIn terms of accountability, it's a bit of a gray area. The mom's actions were overstepping, and the user had the right to set boundaries. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But maybe the user should have communicated better before making the change. However, given the history and the mom's controlling behavior previously mentioned, removing the mom might be a reasonable step. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had the right to take control of their finances and set boundaries. The mom's actions were intrusive, so the user's response is understandable. Answer B.\n"
