Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their mom cry after removing her from a joint bank account. The situation involves a joint account between the author and their mom. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom has been checking the author's spending, which the author finds intrusive and annoying. The mom's calls about the car insurance payments led the author to remove her from the account, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically mean both parties have access and control. The mom might have a right to check the account since it's joint. However, the author feels that the mom's actions are overstepping, especially since they're adults and independent. The key points here are consent for the joint account, the mom's intentions (looking out for her child vs. invading privacy), and the author's reaction (removing the mom without prior discussion).\n\nThe author's argument is about autonomy and privacy. The mom's argument is about care and concern. The problem arises from the joint account setup. If the author no longer wants the mom to have access, removing her might be reasonable, but the method (doing it without discussion) could be seen as abrupt. However, the mom's repeated calls during work might have been the tipping point. The emotional response (crying) is a result of the author's action, but the root cause is the mom's behavior the author found intrusive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the joint account was mutual consent and if the author had discussed their discomfort before removing the mom. If the author didn't communicate their feelings first, maybe they're at fault. But if the mom's actions were indeed overstepping and the author felt it necessary to act, then maybe not. The answer hinges on whether the joint account was still appropriate given their independence and the mom's behavior. Since the author is self-sufficient and the mom's actions are causing distress, the author's decision might be justified. However, the way it was handled could be improved. But the core issue is the mom's access to the account. Removing her might be the right step, but the emotional fallout is unfortunate. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but considering the context, maybe not.\n"
