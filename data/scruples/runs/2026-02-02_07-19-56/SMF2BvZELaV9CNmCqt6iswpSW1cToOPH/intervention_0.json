Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a joint bank account with their mom, and the mom checks the spending history. The person got angry and removed their mom from the account, making their mom cry. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the joint account. When you have a joint account, both parties typically have access to the information. The mom's actions might be intrusive, but she's a co-owner. However, the person is 25, moved out, and is self-sufficient. The mom's concern might stem from worry, but the way she's approaching it\u2014calling multiple times when they're working\u2014could be seen as overstepping.\n\nThe author's reaction was to remove the mom from the account, which led to crying. Was that a justified response? Maybe the author should have addressed the issue calmly instead of cutting off access abruptly. On the other hand, the mom's constant monitoring and calling could be controlling, which the author might have been dealing with since moving out.\n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility in a joint account and how conflicts are resolved. The author's anger is understandable if they feel their privacy is invaded. But removing the mom without discussing it could be seen as harsh. Maybe the right approach is to have a conversation about boundaries rather than an immediate action. However, the mom's actions might also be problematic. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area, but the author's actions led to emotional harm. They might have handled it better by communicating first. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong for not addressing the situation more maturely, hence answer A.\n"
