Growing up this was not a bad idea because if i needed money she could always just put money into my account no problem. \n\nNow im currently 25 and I moved out of the house and to the otherside of the country when I was 21(partially because of my controling parents). Since then I have been self sufficent. \n\nNow its common for my mother to say things such as \"I see you're spending more or you're not saving money\" as much I usually just shrug it off and say sure okay. Although sometimes she notices things such as our it looks like you were charged extra for whatever expense I have monthly. I can understand she is just looking out for me but, I do look at my out balence history and I know where my money is going. \n\nToday she called me 5 times in a row while I was working just to ask why I had too different car insurance payments within 15 days. I got pissed off because it felt like all she called me for was because she was snooping on my balence history. \n\nI angrily told her that im taking her off the joint account because I cannot stand that she keeps callling me about how im spending my money. She ends up crying and hangs up. AITA?\n\n \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a joint bank account between the author and their mother. The author is 25, moved out at 21, and is now self-sufficient. The mom frequently checks their spending and calls about it, which leads to conflict.\n\nFirst, joint accounts typically mean both parties have access. If the mom is part of the account, she can see the transactions. But if the author feels that the mom is overstepping by constantly monitoring and commenting on their spending, that's a problem. The author moved out and is independent, so expecting privacy might be reasonable. The mom's actions, like calling multiple times about minor issues, could be seen as controlling, even if her intention is to help. The author's reaction\u2014removing the mom from the account\u2014might be a way to set boundaries. However, doing so without prior communication could be seen as abrupt. The key points are the control aspect, the mom's over-involvement, and the author's need for independence. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have a right to financial privacy, especially if they are an adult and independent. The mom might need to respect that. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
