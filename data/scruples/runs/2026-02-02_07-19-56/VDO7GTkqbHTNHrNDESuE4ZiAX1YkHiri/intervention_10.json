Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and the author sent the same pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's actions were a form of retaliation. The ex sent a message to his ex-girlfriend, which was inappropriate. The author, instead of just handling it with his girlfriend, decided to confront the ex's girlfriend with the content. \n\nSo, the main points here: the ex's message was clearly wrong, but the author's response might be crossing a line. Even though the ex did something wrong, the author's decision to send the image to the girlfriend could be seen as invasive and potentially causing harm. The girlfriend mentioned she was upset because he interfered in their relationship and could have ended it. The author's intention was to hurt the ex, but using the girlfriend as a means to do that might be unethical. \n\nAlso, the author took it upon himself to act without consulting his girlfriend beyond the initial incident. Even though the girlfriend was annoyed, the author's action led to possible consequences for an innocent third party. The question is whether the ends justify the means. While the ex's actions were wrong, the author's method of retaliation might not be justified because it involved another person who wasn't part of the original conflict. \n\nAdditionally, sending someone else's private message without consent, even if it's to expose wrongdoing, can be seen as a violation of privacy. The author might have thought he was helping his girlfriend, but he overstepped by involving another person's relationship. The girlfriend's reaction about being disappointed in the interference suggests that the author didn't handle it the best way. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author did act in a way that could be perceived as an asshole move because he escalated the situation beyond his control and potentially caused harm to someone else's relationship without their consent. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
