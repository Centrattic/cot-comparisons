Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending his girlfriend's ex's dick pic to the ex's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the ex sent a dick pic to the author's girlfriend with a suggestive message. The author saw this, saved the image, and then sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship, even though she acknowledged it was funny.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and privacy. The author took a private message meant for his girlfriend and shared it with another person. Even though the ex initiated the inappropriate message, the author's response was to retaliate by exposing the ex's actions to his girlfriend. \n\nLegally, sharing a private message without consent could be a violation of privacy. But the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The author's girlfriend is upset because he involved himself in another couple's business. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's action of forwarding the image to his girlfriend's girlfriend could be seen as crossing a line. The author's intention was to hurt the ex, but the effect was also to potentially embarrass an innocent person (the ex's girlfriend). \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important here. She's disappointed that he took matters into his own hands. Relationships often require respecting boundaries, and interfering in another couple's issues can lead to unintended consequences. \n\nSo, even if the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response was not appropriate. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because he violated privacy and overstepped by involving another person.\n"
