Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did something wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend got a dick pic from her ex, who was already a bitter ex. The author saw it, was upset, and then sent the same picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is now upset because he interfered in someone else's relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author took the picture from his girlfriend's WhatsApp. Even though he might have good reasons for being angry, accessing her messages without her explicit permission might be a privacy issue. But maybe since he was with her when it happened, he saw it, so maybe that's different. Not sure.\n\nThen, he sent the picture to the ex's girlfriend. That seems pretty invasive. The ex's girlfriend isn't part of the conflict between the author and his girlfriend. The author is punishing the ex by exposing his behavior to his girlfriend, which could potentially end their relationship. But is that justified?\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he got involved in someone else's relationship. The author's intention was to hurt the ex, but he ended up affecting an innocent person. Even if the ex is an asshole, sending the pic to the girlfriend without her consent is a violation of her privacy. The author might have thought it would teach the ex a lesson, but it could have broader negative consequences for the ex's girlfriend.\n\nAlso, the author didn't consult his girlfriend before taking action. He did it on his own, which might have been a breach of trust. The girlfriend might feel that he overstepped by not letting her handle it herself.\n\nThere's also the issue of using someone else's personal content against them. The ex sent a dick pic, which is inappropriate, but the author retaliated in kind by sending it to the ex's girlfriend. This could be seen as a form of revenge, which isn't really a valid justification. The author might argue self-defense or protecting his partner, but the method used is questionable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's actions could be considered a form of emotional harm on an innocent third party. The ex's girlfriend didn't do anything to the author or his girlfriend, so she shouldn't be punished for his actions. The author's intention might have been to protect his girlfriend, but the method was aggressive and invasive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong. His actions were a violation of privacy, he involved a third party unnecessarily, and he acted without consent from his girlfriend. Even if the ex was an asshole, the retaliatory action was not justified. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
