Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the guy's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic. The guy saw it, sent it to himself, then sent it to the ex's girlfriend. His girlfriend is upset with him for interfering.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the guy overstepped by sharing the image without permission. Even though he was angry about the ex's actions, sending someone else's private content, even if it's to another person, is a violation of privacy. The ex sent the pic to his ex, but the guy took it upon himself to share it with the ex's current girlfriend. That's not his place.\n\nHe might have thought it was funny or a way to teach the ex a lesson, but it's not his responsibility to act as a judge and jury. Also, the recipient of the original pic (the girlfriend) didn't want to engage, and the guy decided to take matters into his own hands. That's where the problem lies. He involved himself in another couple's relationship, which can be seen as meddling and potentially harmful. Even if his intention was to hurt the ex, it's not a valid reason to invade someone else's privacy. The fact that his girlfriend is still annoyed shows that he didn't consider the consequences properly. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
