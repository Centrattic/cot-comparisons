Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post did something wrong. The situation involves the author sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex sent an inappropriate message to the author's girlfriend, which was pretty creepy. The author felt justified in responding by forwarding the same message to the ex's girlfriend to show him the consequences. But here's the thing: even though the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response might be crossing a line.\n\nSo, the key points are: the ex sent a dick pic with a suggestive message. The author, instead of just blocking or ignoring, took it further by sending the same image to the ex's girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. The author might have thought it was a way to teach the ex a lesson, but using someone else's private message without consent could be seen as invading the ex's privacy and potentially causing harm to another person's relationship.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Even if the ex was in the wrong, sending someone else's private content without their permission is generally considered a violation of privacy. The author might have wanted to retaliate, but the method chosen could be seen as harassment or a form of revenge that affects an innocent third party. The girlfriend's anger makes sense because the author didn't just handle his own feelings but involved another person's relationship, which can be seen as meddling.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author thought he was protecting his girlfriend and stopping the ex, but the way he did it might not be the best approach. There's also the act of taking and saving the message without the ex's knowledge, which is another privacy issue. Even if the ex initiated the inappropriate behavior, the author's response isn't legally or ethically justified in most contexts. People have the right to privacy, and forwarding private messages without consent can lead to legal consequences in some places.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the ex's actions were bad, but the author's response, while understandable, goes beyond justifiable self-defense or protecting his partner. It invades the privacy of the ex and his girlfriend, and it's a form of escalation that could cause unnecessary harm. The girlfriend's disappointment stems from the author overstepping his role by interfering in another couple's affairs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions, while reactive, were not appropriate and could be seen as malicious or intrusive.\n"
