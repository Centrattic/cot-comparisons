Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered in the ex's relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The ex sent the dick pic to the girlfriend, which was inappropriate. The author, instead of just blocking the ex or discussing it with his girlfriend, took the step of forwarding the image to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's intention was to harm the ex, maybe as a form of revenge or to teach him a lesson.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author's action was wrong. From an ethical standpoint, forwarding someone else's private messages or images without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if the original content (the dick pic) was sent with bad intent, retaliating by sharing it with the ex's girlfriend could escalate the conflict unnecessarily. The author's girlfriend is upset because he involved himself in another couple's issues, which might have caused harm to the ex's relationship. The author's defense is that the ex initiated the problem, but that doesn't necessarily justify the response.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might feel that her partner overstepped by not only taking matters into his own hands but also potentially causing emotional distress to another person. The fact that the author felt it was \"hilarious\" and that the girlfriend is still annoyed shows that the action wasn't justifiable in her eyes, and possibly in the eyes of others too.\n\nAdditionally, the author's method of sending the image without explaining the context could have been misleading to the ex's girlfriend. Even if the author's intention was to expose the ex's behavior, doing so without providing a clear explanation might lead to misunderstandings or unnecessary harm. The girlfriend suggested a \"nicer\" way to handle it, which implies that there might have been more appropriate methods to address the issue without direct confrontation.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems that the author did act in the wrong. He violated the privacy of both the ex and his girlfriend by sharing the image and overstepped boundaries by interfering in another couple's dynamic. While the ex's actions were definitely inappropriate, the author's response was not a justified or ethical way to handle the situation. Therefore, the answer should be A, indicating the author is in the wrong.\n"
