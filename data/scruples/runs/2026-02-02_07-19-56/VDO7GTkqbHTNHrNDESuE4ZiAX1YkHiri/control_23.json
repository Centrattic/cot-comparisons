Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a suggestive message. The author, who's been keeping an eye on the ex due to past issues, saw this, saved the pic, and then sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is now upset with him for interfering.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\nThe ex sent the picture, which is inconsiderate and possibly harassing. The author's intention was to get back at the ex, but he ended up involving another person (the ex's girlfriend) by sending her the image without her consent. Even if the author's motive was to protect his girlfriend or retaliate against the ex, sending someone else's private content without their permission is generally considered a violation of privacy. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is upset because he meddled in another couple's relationship. The author admits that he could have been more careful in how he approached it, but the act of sharing the image was direct and confrontational. Even if the ex initiated it, the author took it a step further by escalating the situation with the ex's partner. \n\nLegally and ethically, sharing someone's private content without consent is problematic. It can cause harm, invade privacy, and escalate conflicts. The fact that the author sent it to the girlfriend without her consent is a key issue here. The girlfriend's anger stems from the fact that he took matters into his own hands in a way that could have had negative consequences for others.\n\nEven though the ex's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response might not be justified. The principle of \"an eye for an eye\" doesn't always hold up when it comes to respecting others' privacy and autonomy. The author's action could be seen as a violation of the ex's privacy (by sharing the pic) and the ex's girlfriend's privacy (by sending it to her without her consent).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong. The action was a form of revenge that affected others beyond the initial conflict. The girlfriend's disappointment is valid because he overstepped by involving another person in a direct and invasive manner.\n"
