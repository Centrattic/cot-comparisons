Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author's girlfriend was contacted by her ex, who sent a dick pic. The author, angry about this, took the message, sent it to the ex's new girlfriend, and then told his girlfriend what he did. His girlfriend is upset because he interfered in someone else's relationship and was harsh towards the ex's girlfriend, even if he thought he was protecting his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is whether the author had the right to send that picture to the ex's girlfriend. Even if the ex's actions were inappropriate, the author's response could be seen as escalating the conflict and invading the privacy of another person. \n\nThe author might argue that the ex initiated the problem by sending the picture, so he's just retaliating. But the key point is that he took a private message from his girlfriend and shared it with someone else without consent. This is a breach of trust, not just with his girlfriend but also with the ex's girlfriend. \n\nAlso, the author's girlfriend is upset that he involved himself in another relationship. Even if his intentions were to protect his girlfriend, the method was questionable. Sending the picture as a direct message on Facebook could be seen as a harsh and public way to confront the ex's girlfriend. The author might have thought he was exposing the ex, but it's possible that the girlfriend didn't know about the messages, and now she's caught in the middle of a dispute between two other people.\n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't have the ex's girlfriend's consent to share that information. Even if the ex sent the picture to his ex, the author's action of forwarding it to another person without her consent is a privacy violation. The ex's girlfriend might feel embarrassed or upset, which the author acknowledges by feeling bad about being harsh towards her.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important here. She's not just annoyed but concerned that the author could have ended the ex's relationship. While the author might feel justified, his actions crossed a line by involving another person's private information without permission. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions were a privacy violation and an overstep, even if his intentions were to stand up for his girlfriend. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
