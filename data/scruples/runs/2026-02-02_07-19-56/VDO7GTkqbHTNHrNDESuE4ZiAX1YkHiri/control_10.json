Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the ex sent a dick pic to the author's girlfriend with a suggestive caption. The author saw it, and instead of confronting the ex, he sent the picture to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he meddled in another relationship.\n\nThe key points here: The author didn't have the right to send someone else's private message to another person. Even if the ex initiated the harassment, the author's response escalated the situation. He violated privacy by sharing the message without consent. The girlfriend's concern is valid because he involved himself in their relationship, which can be seen as unkind and intrusive.\n\nEven though the ex was at fault, the author's actions went beyond justifiable defense. He used the ex's misdeed as a weapon, potentially harming an innocent person (the ex's girlfriend) by exposing her partner's behavior. This could have caused her distress and damaged their relationship. The author's intention was to hurt the ex, but the method was inappropriate and crossed ethical boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are important. The author's action, while understandable in anger, was a breach of privacy and meddling in others' affairs. So, the answer is A.\n"
