Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that his girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a caption, and the author sent that same pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The author is asking if he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The ex had already been sending messages to the author's girlfriend after the breakup, which is kind of a red flag. The author's girlfriend had blocked him except on WhatsApp, and the ex sent the inappropriate message. The author, seeing this, took it upon himself to forward the picture to the ex's girlfriend. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author overstepped. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. Even though the ex's actions were inappropriate, the author took a direct and potentially harmful action. Sending someone an explicit image without their consent is a violation of privacy and can be considered harassment, regardless of the context. The author's intention might have been to teach the ex a lesson or protect his girlfriend, but forwarding the image to the ex's girlfriend could have caused unnecessary harm to an innocent person. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important here. She's disappointed that he took it upon himself to intervene in another relationship, which suggests that the author's actions were not considered appropriate. Even if he thought he was justifying it by the ex's behavior, the method he chose was invasive and could lead to serious consequences, like the ex's girlfriend feeling violated or the ex's relationship being ruined. \n\nAlso, the author admits that he felt odd sending it and that the girlfriend's anger is justified. The fact that he had to ask if he's an asshole shows that he's aware there's a possibility he's wrong. The line between standing up for his partner and overstepping into another person's privacy is thin here. \n\nIn many cases, the appropriate response would be to confront the ex directly, involve authorities if necessary, or let the ex's current girlfriend find out on her own if the ex's behavior continues. Forwarding the image without consent is a clear violation, even in the context of a past relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while possibly motivated by protecting his girlfriend, crossed a boundary by invading the privacy of another individual. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
