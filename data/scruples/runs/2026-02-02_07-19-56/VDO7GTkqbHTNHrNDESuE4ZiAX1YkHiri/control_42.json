Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The author's girlfriend broke up with her ex, who then sent her a dick pic. The author saw this, saved the image, and sent it to the ex's girlfriend to teach him a lesson. The girlfriend is now upset with the author for getting involved.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, let's think about the actions. The ex's behavior was clearly inappropriate by sending a dick pic. The author's response was to retaliate by sharing that image with the ex's girlfriend. While the ex deserves some blame for his actions, the author's retaliation might cross a line. \n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author didn't get permission from anyone to share the image. Even though the ex sent it to his ex-girlfriend, the author taking that image and forwarding it to the girlfriend without consent is a privacy violation. The author might have intended to hurt the ex, but the method involved exposing someone else to an image they didn't consent to see. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in another relationship. The author might have thought it was justified because the ex was in the wrong, but their action could have caused harm to another person (the ex's girlfriend) and potentially destroyed a relationship. Even if the ex deserved it, the author's actions were a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nAdditionally, the author's girlfriend is disappointed because he took it upon himself to act without discussing it with her. That shows that the author overstepped his role in the situation. \n\nSo, while the ex's behavior was bad, the author's response was equally problematic. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they violated privacy, acted without consent, and caused potential harm to others.\n"
