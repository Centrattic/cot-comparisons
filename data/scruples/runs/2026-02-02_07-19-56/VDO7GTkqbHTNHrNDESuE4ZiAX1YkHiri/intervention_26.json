Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and then the author forwarded that pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author's girlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago. The ex has been trying to contact her, which led to the author disliking him. When the ex sent a dick pic, the author saw it, saved it, and then sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in another couple's relationship. The author justifies his actions by saying the ex started it, but he also admits to feeling bad about hurting the other girl, though he wanted to hurt the ex more.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main points are: sending someone else's private message without consent, even if it's something inappropriate. The author took a screenshot of a message that was sent to his girlfriend without her knowledge and then forwarded it to someone else. That seems like a violation of privacy, even if the original message was inappropriate.\n\nEven though the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend's anger is about the author involving himself in another couple's business and not approaching the ex's girlfriend in a respectful way. The author's method was to send the explicit image directly, which could be considered malicious or bullying. The argument that \"he did it first\" doesn't necessarily justify retaliating in a similar fashion. There's a principle here of not engaging in tit-for-tat behavior, especially when it affects others who aren't directly responsible for the initial wrongdoing (the ex's girlfriend).\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent. The author didn't get his girlfriend's permission to forward the message. Even if she was present when it happened, she might not have agreed to the action. The girlfriend's later blocking the ex herself suggests she didn't want the author to take matters into his own hands. \n\nAdditionally, sending explicit content to someone else's partner, regardless of the intent, can be seen as a violation of trust and respect. The author's girlfriend's disappointment stems from the fact that he acted without considering the potential consequences on the other couple and without consulting her. \n\nSo, even though the ex's behavior was inexcusable, the author's response was a private, vengeful act that could have caused unnecessary harm. The question is whether the ends justify the means. In ethical terms, it's often considered wrong to do something unethical even if it's in response to an unethical act. The author's actions could be seen as a form of cyberbullying or harassment, which is generally discouraged. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he violated privacy, acted without consent, and used a method that could be considered harmful and disrespectful. The girlfriend's anger is justified because he interfered in another couple's relationship in a way that's not constructive or respectful.\n"
