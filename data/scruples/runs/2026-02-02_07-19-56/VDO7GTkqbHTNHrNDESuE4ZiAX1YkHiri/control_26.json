Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and the author then sent that same pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The author is now getting some backlash from his girlfriend for interfering.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The ex sent a dick pic to the girlfriend after a breakup a year ago. The girlfriend had blocked him except for WhatsApp, and the author saw the message. He saved the pic, deleted the conversation, and later sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in another couple's relationship.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's action was a direct retaliation against the ex for sending the inappropriate message. However, sending someone else's private messages without consent is generally not okay. Even if the ex was in the wrong by sending the pic, the author didn't have the right to share it with the ex's girlfriend. This could be considered an invasion of privacy for both the ex and the girlfriend of the ex. The author might have done this to hurt the ex, but using the girlfriend as a medium could have caused her emotional distress without her consent.\n\nThe girlfriend of the author is upset because he interfered in another relationship. She's concerned about the potential fallout for the other couple and that the author could have approached it differently. While the ex's actions were inappropriate, the author's response escalated the situation in a way that might be considered harsh and unethical. The author might feel justified because the ex started it, but the act of sharing the picture without consent is a breach of privacy. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he felt bad about being harsh to the other girl, which shows some awareness of the potential harm. However, even with good intentions, sharing someone's private content without permission is a violation. Relationships, especially past ones, have boundaries that should be respected. The author crossed those boundaries by taking matters into his own hands instead of addressing the issue with his girlfriend or the ex directly.\n\nIn conclusion, the author acted in a way that's not acceptable because he violated privacy and interfered in another couple's affairs. Even if the ex was at fault, the method of response was inappropriate. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
