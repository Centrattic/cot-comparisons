Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The guy's girlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago, and the ex is still trying to contact her. The ex sent a dick pic to the girlfriend with a suggestive message. The guy saw this, saved the conversation, and then sent the pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author acted wrongly by forwarding the explicit image. Legally, sending someone else's private content without consent is a violation of privacy and could be considered harassment or even a form of revenge porn. Even if the ex sent the image first, the author took it upon himself to retaliate by sharing it with the ex's girlfriend. \n\nEthically, this is a gray area. The ex's actions were clearly inappropriate, but the author's response might have been an overstep. While the ex initiated the harassment, the author's decision to forward the image to the ex's girlfriend could be seen as invading the privacy of another person. The girlfriend's reaction that she's disappointed in the author for interfering is valid because he didn't just confront the ex but also involved the ex's partner, which escalates the situation. \n\nMoreover, even if the author's intention was to protect his girlfriend and get revenge on the ex, the method was problematic. Instead of confronting the ex directly or blocking him, he chose a more invasive approach. This could lead to unintended consequences for the ex's girlfriend, who might now be in a difficult position, having to deal with her partner's past actions revealed in this way. \n\nThe author does express some guilt about being harsh towards the ex's girlfriend, which suggests he recognizes the potential for his actions to cause harm. However, the key point is that he didn't have the right to share someone else's private information, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, sharing explicit images without consent is illegal, especially if it's done to retaliate or harm someone else. Even in places where it's not illegal, it's widely considered unethical and a violation of trust and privacy.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical perspectives, the author is in the wrong for forwarding the image to the ex's girlfriend. The right action would have been to block the ex and not engage in further retaliation, especially by involving third parties.\n"
