Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from the ex to his girlfriend. So first, I need to analyze the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend was sent a dick pic by her ex, who's now in a relationship. The author, feeling angry, took the photo, sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The author's girlfriend was upset about this interference. The key points here are: the author's intent, the consequences, and whether the action was justified.\n\nThe ex sent the message first, which was inappropriate. The author's reaction was to retaliate by sharing the photo to the ex's current girlfriend. Even though the author might have thought it was justified as revenge, sending someone's private content without consent is a violation of their privacy. It's similar to cyberbullying or harassment. The author didn't just confront the ex directly but instead targeted the girlfriend, which complicates things. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important here. She's upset because the author meddled in another relationship, which is a common concern in such situations. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's action could have caused harm to an innocent person (the ex's GF) and potentially ruined relationships. The author might think they're standing up for their girlfriend, but the method is questionable. \n\nLegally, sharing someone's private photos without consent can be a civil issue, like revenge porn. Ethically, it's about respecting others' privacy. The author might have acted out of anger, but that doesn't excuse the action. The fact that the author sent the photo to the girl directly, rather than confronting the ex, shows they targeted the innocent party, which is wrong. \n\nSo, even though the ex initiated the problem, the author's response was not appropriate. They should have handled it by blocking the ex, confronting the ex directly, or perhaps telling the GF about the ex's behavior without sharing the photo. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for escalating the situation and involving another person in a harmful way.\n"
