Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the ex sent a dick pic to the girlfriend. The author, who's the boyfriend, saw this, saved the picture, and then sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in the other couple's relationship. The author argues he was just getting back at the ex for sending the inappropriate message.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is wrong. From a legal standpoint, sending someone's private messages without consent is usually illegal. But we're looking at a moral or ethical standpoint here. Even if the ex did something wrong, forwarding that to his girlfriend without the ex's permission is a breach of privacy. The author took it upon himself to retaliate, which can be seen as crossing a line. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he involved himself in another couple's issues and potentially caused harm to an innocent person (the ex's girlfriend). While the ex's actions were inappropriate, the author's response might be considered an escalation. The key point is consent and respecting privacy. The author didn't have the ex's consent to share the message, and he also didn't consider the impact on the ex's girlfriend, even if he thought it was justified. \n\nSo, ethically, the author overstepped by taking matters into his own hands and invading someone else's privacy. He could have addressed it by blocking the ex or confronting him directly instead of retaliating against the ex's partner. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
