Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nSo, the author's girlfriend received a dick pic from her ex, who is now in a relationship. The author saw it, got angry, and then sent the picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship. The author feels bad about being harsh to the girl but thought it was to hurt the ex more.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author's actions were a form of retaliation. He took something private (the dick pic) that was intended for his girlfriend and then shared it with the ex's girlfriend. Even if the intent was to get back at the ex, sharing someone else's private content without consent is generally considered a violation of privacy. \n\nAlso, the author had no right to act on behalf of his girlfriend. While the ex's actions were inappropriate, the author's response might have escalated the situation unnecessarily. The girlfriend was already handling it by ignoring the message and blocking the ex. By sending the picture to the ex's girlfriend, the author could have caused harm to another person's relationship, which his girlfriend is now worried about. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The author didn't get permission from his girlfriend before sharing the picture. Even though they were in the same room and discussed it, the decision to retaliate wasn't mutual. The girlfriend's reaction shows that she didn't agree with his approach, and she's upset because he took that action without consulting her further.\n\nAdditionally, the author's method of \"teaching a lesson\" might be seen as vindictive rather than constructive. Instead of addressing the ex's behavior through appropriate channels (like blocking him or confronting him directly), he chose a more harmful path that involved another person. This could lead to further conflict and potential legal issues if sharing the image is considered harassment or distribution of explicit content without consent.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex's actions were clearly wrong, sending a dick pic with a provocative message to an ex-girlfriend. The author was justified in being angry. However, the response doesn't address the root issue (the ex's behavior) but instead harms an innocent third party, the ex's girlfriend. This might not be the most ethical approach.\n\nIn many relationships, respecting boundaries and not interfering in others' relationships is important. The author's girlfriend is disappointed because he crossed that line. The key here is whether the means justify the ends. Even if the ex deserved it, retaliating by involving the ex's girlfriend could be seen as going too far.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's actions, while understandable in anger, were unethical and crossed a line into invading someone else's privacy and potentially causing harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
