Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sent the ex's dick pic to the ex's girlfriend is in the wrong. The situation is a little complicated.\n\nFirst, the guy's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a message. The guy saw it, felt angry, took a screenshot, and sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. Now, the girlfriend is upset that he interfered in another couple's relationship. \n\nHmm. So the main issue here is about privacy and respecting boundaries. The ex sent an inappropriate message to his ex's ex. The author's reaction was to forward that to the current girlfriend. Even though the ex was the one who sent the picture, the author is taking it upon himself to retaliate. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) Did the author have the right to forward the image? 2) Was it ethical to involve the ex's girlfriend? \n\nEven if the ex did something wrong, forwarding private messages without consent is generally not acceptable. The author might have a right to be upset, but taking matters into his own hands by sharing the image could be considered a violation of privacy for both the ex and his girlfriend. Also, the girlfriend's reaction points out that he overstepped by being \"in your face\" and not giving her a choice. \n\nSo, even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's actions crossed a line. He didn't just block the ex; he took a screenshot and shared it with the girlfriend, potentially causing harm to another relationship. That seems like a breach of privacy and possibly escalating the conflict in an unprofessional way. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he violated privacy and acted without considering the consequences on others.\n"
