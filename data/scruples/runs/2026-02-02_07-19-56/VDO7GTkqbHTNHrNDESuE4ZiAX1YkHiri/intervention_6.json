Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author sending a nude photo from his girlfriend's ex to that ex's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The author's girlfriend was sent a dick pic by her ex, which the author saw. He then sent the same pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overstepped by sharing someone else's private content, even if it was a nude. Even though the ex initiated the inappropriate message, the author's response was to retaliate by forwarding the image. That's a problem because sharing someone's explicit content without their consent is generally considered a violation of privacy and trust. It's not just about the initial act of the ex but the author's decision to take matters into his own hands.\n\nAlso, the author's girlfriend is upset because he didn't communicate this in a \"nicer way\" and instead was confrontational. The author's intention might have been to hurt the ex, but using another person (the ex's girlfriend) as a pawn in that retaliation could be seen as cruel. Even if the ex is a jerk, the method of response here is questionable.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent. The ex sent the nude to his ex-partner, but the author didn't have the right to share it further. That act of sharing could be considered a form of revenge, which is often not the healthiest or most appropriate way to handle conflict. It might escalate tensions and cause more harm than good, not just to the ex but also to the ex's girlfriend, who might now be involved in a conflict she didn't ask for.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's reaction points to the fact that the author's actions might have crossed a line. She's upset about him interfering in another relationship, which suggests that the author didn't respect their boundaries. Even if the initial action by the ex was wrong, the author's response was equally problematic because it involved third parties and private material.\n\nIn many places, sharing someone's explicit photos without their permission can have legal consequences, such as being considered a form of harassment or violating privacy laws. So from a legal standpoint, the author might also be at risk here.\n\nIn summary, while the ex's actions were clearly inappropriate, the author's response of forwarding the image to the ex's girlfriend was a violation of privacy and an overreaction. The author took a vengeful approach that could have serious repercussions and is likely to be seen as in the wrong. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
