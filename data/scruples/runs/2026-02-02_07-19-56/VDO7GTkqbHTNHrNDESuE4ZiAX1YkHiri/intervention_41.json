Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend was sent a dick pic by her ex. The author, who's in a new relationship, saw this, got angry, and decided to take action. He sent the same image to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's business, and the author feels he's being harsh but thinks he was justified because the ex initiated it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about the key points. \n\n1. **Consent and Privacy**: The author didn't have the ex's permission to share his private content. Even if the ex sent something inappropriate, taking screenshots or forwarding it without consent is a violation of privacy. \n\n2. **Right to Retaliation**: Just because someone does something wrong doesn't mean it's okay to retaliate. The author could have handled it differently, like confronting his girlfriend's ex directly or ignoring it, but forwarding the image to his girlfriend is crossing a line.\n\n3. **Impact on Others**: The author's action affected the ex's girlfriend, who might not have known her partner was in contact with his ex. This could cause her emotional distress and potentially harm their relationship. The author acknowledges this but still sent the image, which is a problem.\n\n4. **Author's Motivation**: The author mentions he did it to hurt the ex more, which is a vengeful motive. While he might feel justified, revenge doesn't make the action right. It's important to consider the consequences of such actions on others.\n\n5. **Relationship Boundaries**: The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered where he shouldn't have. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's response was inappropriate. Relationships often require respecting boundaries, and this seems like a breach of that.\n\nPutting this all together, the author's actions were a violation of privacy, acted out of revenge, and caused potential harm to another person's relationship. Even though the ex started it, the author's response was not acceptable. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
