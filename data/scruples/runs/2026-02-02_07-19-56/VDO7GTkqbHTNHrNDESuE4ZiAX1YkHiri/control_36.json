Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend received a dick pic from her ex. The author saw it, felt angry, and then took the photo and sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in someone else's relationship. The question is whether the author did the wrong thing.\n\nAlright, so the main points here. The ex sent the pic, which is inappropriate and invasive. The author then retaliated by sending the same pic to the ex's girlfriend. Now, even though the ex initiated the bad behavior, does the author's response cross a line?\n\nI need to consider the ethical angle here. Retaliation in relationships, especially involving private and explicit content, can be problematic. The author might think they were protecting their girlfriend, but forwarding explicit content without consent is generally not okay. Even if the original action was wrong, forwarding it to the ex's girlfriend could cause harm to someone else (the girlfriend) who wasn't involved in the initial conflict. \n\nThe author's girlfriend is upset because he involved others. The author might have intended to hurt the ex, but by doing so, they put the ex's girlfriend in a difficult situation. Even if the author believed they were being justified, the action of forwarding explicit content without consent is typically considered a violation of privacy and could be seen as a mean or vengeful act. \n\nIn many cases, taking matters into your own hands by spreading explicit content, even if the original sender is at fault, is not the right approach. The author could have addressed the issue by blocking the ex, confronting the ex directly, or discussing it with their girlfriend without escalating it to involve others. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. They took a vengeful action that affected another person negatively, even if it was in response to an initial wrongdoing. The ethical choice would be to not spread the explicit content further, regardless of intent.\n"
