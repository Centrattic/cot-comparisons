Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the ex sent a dick pic to the girlfriend, which was clearly inappropriate. The author saw it, and instead of just blocking the ex, he took the pic and sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's retaliation. Even though the ex initiated the harassment, the author's response was to forward the explicit content to the ex's girlfriend. That's a violation of privacy for both the ex and the girlfriend. The author might think it's justified because the ex was in the wrong, but forwarding such a private message without consent is a breach of trust. It's not just about the content but also about the act of sharing it without permission. \n\nThe author's girlfriend is upset because he meddled in another couple's business. Even if the ex deserved it, the author's actions could have serious consequences for the ex's relationship. Plus, the author didn't just confront the ex but escalated the situation by involving the girlfriend. That's pretty harsh, and it's understandable why the girlfriend is disappointed. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that he felt bad about being harsh towards the ex's girlfriend. That shows he recognizes the potential harm. The line between justice and revenge is thin here. The author's actions, while a response to harassment, crossed into unethical territory by sharing private content. \n\nSo, even though the ex started it, the author's retaliation was not the right approach. The correct action would have been to block the ex and address the issue without involving others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
