Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy found out that his girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic. He sent the pic to the ex's girlfriend to confront him. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. \n\nSo the main question is: Was that action wrong? Well, let's think about privacy. The ex's girlfriend wasn't part of this situation; she's the third party here. By sending the picture to her, he's violating both the ex's privacy and maybe the ex's girlfriend's. Even if the ex sent the pic to his ex, forwarding it without consent is a breach of privacy. The guy might have felt justified in wanting to teach the ex a lesson, but the method he used could have caused harm to another person. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She was upset about him getting involved in another couple's business. That's a valid concern because it's not his place to interfere. Even if the ex did something wrong, spreading the picture to the girlfriend might have made the situation worse. The guy admitted to feeling bad about being harsh towards the ex's girlfriend, which suggests he knows it's not right. \n\nAlso, the act of sending the picture without asking the ex's girlfriend could be seen as a violation of her privacy. She might not have wanted to see that, and it could lead to her breaking up with the ex. The guy's intention was to hurt the ex, but the collateral damage on the girlfriend is another issue. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's response escalated the conflict in a way that isn't constructive. The right approach might have been to block the ex and not engage further, rather than trying to publicly shame him by sending the pic to his girlfriend. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author's actions were a violation of privacy and overstepped his bounds by involving another person in the conflict. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
