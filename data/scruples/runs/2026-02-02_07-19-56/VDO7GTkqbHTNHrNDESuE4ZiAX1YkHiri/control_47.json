Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending the ex's dick pic to the ex's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend was sent a dick pic by her ex, who's now in a new relationship. The author, feeling angry, sent the photo to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in someone else's relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here. The ex sent the message, which was inappropriate. The author didn't just block the ex but took it further by sharing the content with the ex's current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he crossed a line, even if the ex was at fault.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Retaliation in this form can be seen as violating privacy. Even if the ex initiated something wrong, sharing the photo without consent is a privacy violation. The author might have intended to hurt the ex, but the method involved another person's privacy. The girlfriend's reaction is based on the idea that intervening in another relationship isn't their place. \n\nAlso, the author's justification that the ex started it doesn't necessarily absolve him. People are generally expected to handle conflicts without invading others' privacy, even if the other person is at fault. The ex's girlfriend was the unintended victim here, which adds to the problem. \n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could have caused unnecessary harm to the ex's girlfriend, even if the ex is in the wrong. The girlfriend's disappointment stems from the author's lack of judgment in handling the situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were a breach of privacy and overstepped boundaries, even if the ex was the initial wrongdoer. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
