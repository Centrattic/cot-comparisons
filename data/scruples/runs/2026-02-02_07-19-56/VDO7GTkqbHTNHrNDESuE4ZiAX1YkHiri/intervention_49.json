Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a guy who sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. The ex had sent the inappropriate image to his ex to the author's girlfriend, and the author, instead of just blocking the ex or confronting him, decided to retaliate by sharing the image with the ex's new girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship.\n\nFirst, I should consider the act of forwarding explicit content without consent. Even if the ex initiated the situation by sending the image, the author is still taking a private, non-consensual photo and distributing it further. That's a problem because it violates privacy. The ex's girlfriend wasn't part of the original situation; she's just the current partner of someone who made a mistake. By sending the photo to her, the author is adding insult to injury, potentially causing her emotional distress. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he felt bad about being harsh to the ex's girlfriend, which shows he recognizes that his actions might have negative consequences. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered and didn't handle it in a more respectful way. Even though the author's intention was to retaliate against the ex, the method he chose involved another person who wasn't responsible for the initial wrongdoing. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, forwarding explicit images without consent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the context. It can lead to harassment or invasion of privacy. The author's actions could be seen as cyberbullying or revenge, which often have negative repercussions. Even if the ex was at fault, the author escalated the situation in a way that involves a third party. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex did send the image first, which was inappropriate. But that doesn't justify the author's response. The correct action would be to delete the image, block the ex, and maybe confront the ex directly, not involve another person by sharing the image. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions cross a line by involving the ex's girlfriend. Therefore, he is in the wrong."
