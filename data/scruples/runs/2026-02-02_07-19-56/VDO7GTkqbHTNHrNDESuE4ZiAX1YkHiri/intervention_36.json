Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user sent a dick pic to his girlfriend's ex, and then the author (the boyfriend) sent that same pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the ex sent the inappropriate message. The author's girlfriend ignored it, but he didn't. He took the picture, sent it to himself, deleted the conversation, and then sent it to the ex's girlfriend. \n\nSo, the key points here: The author took a private, explicit image that was sent to his girlfriend and forwarded it to someone else without consent. Even though the ex was the one who sent the inappropriate message, the author's action of forwarding it without the ex's or his girlfriend's permission is problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. The author might think he's retaliating, but forwarding explicit content is a violation of privacy. It could harm the other person's relationship and is a form of harassment or spreading non-consensual intimate images. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The ex didn't consent to have his picture shared with his girlfriend, and the author didn't get permission from his girlfriend either. Even if the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response crosses a line into unethical behavior. \n\nSo, even though the ex's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response is not justified. The right thing would have been to confront the ex directly or involve authorities if needed, but not to retaliate by spreading the image. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
