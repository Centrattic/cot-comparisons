Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The ex sent a dick pic to the author's girlfriend, which is inappropriate and shows a lack of respect. The author, feeling upset, sent the same image to the ex's girlfriend. The main issue here is the act of forwarding private content without consent.\n\nEven though the ex initiated the inappropriate message, the author's response might be seen as taking matters into their own hands. The author's girlfriend was upset with him for interfering in another relationship. The key points here are consent and privacy. The author didn't have the ex's permission to share his private image, regardless of the context. \n\nAlso, the author's intention was to hurt the ex, but the method involved potentially harming the ex's girlfriend by exposing her partner's private content. This could damage the ex girlfriend's trust and lead to consequences she's not prepared for. The author's action might be considered a violation of privacy, even if he thought it was justified.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. She felt it was harsh and that the author shouldn't have interfered. The author's actions could be seen as escalating the conflict in an unconstructive way. While the ex was at fault first, the author's response was not appropriate. \n\nIn many cases, sharing someone else's private content without consent is considered a breach of trust and can be harmful. So, despite the initial provocation, the author's action is likely in the wrong because he violated the privacy of another person and took it upon himself to retaliate in a way that could cause further issues.\n"
