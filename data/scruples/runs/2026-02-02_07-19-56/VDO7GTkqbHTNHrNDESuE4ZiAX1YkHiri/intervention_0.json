Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for forwarding a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the ex sent a dick pic to his ex-girlfriend (now the author's girlfriend) with a suggestive message. The author saw this, saved the pic, and then sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in someone else's relationship and could have caused issues there.\n\nSo, the main points here are privacy and consent. The author didn't have permission to share the picture. Even if the ex deserved it, forwarding private content without consent is a breach of trust. Also, the author's girlfriend was upset about him involving himself in another couple's business. \n\nEven though the ex's actions were inappropriate, the author's response escalates the situation in a way that's not healthy. Instead of addressing it directly with the ex or letting his girlfriend handle it, he took matters into his own hands, which could lead to more conflict. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction indicates that she values boundaries, and the author crossing those lines might have done more harm than good. The act of sending the picture to the ex's girlfriend is a violation of privacy, regardless of the intentions. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
