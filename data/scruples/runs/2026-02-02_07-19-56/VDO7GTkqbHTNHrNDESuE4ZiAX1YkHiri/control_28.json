Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who sent a dick pic to his girlfriend's ex and then forwarded it to the ex's girlfriend is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a suggestive caption. The author saw this, recovered the message, and sent the image to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship and was harsh. The author feels he was defending his girlfriend but acknowledges being harsh on an innocent person.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The ex sent an inappropriate message, which is clearly wrong. However, the author's response was to retaliate by sending the image to the ex's girlfriend. Even if the author's intention was to teach the ex a lesson, is it justified to involve the ex's girlfriend? \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, forwarding such an image could lead to issues like harassment or invasion of privacy, especially if the ex's girlfriend wasn't a willing recipient. Even if the author's intention was to inform her, the method was direct and potentially harmful. \n\nEthically, the author took matters into his own hands without the consent of his girlfriend, which she later expressed being upset about. She wanted to block him herself, and he took action without her input. This shows a lack of respect for her autonomy in handling the situation. \n\nAlso, the author's action might be seen as a violation of the ex's privacy. The ex sent the message, but the author's response escalates the conflict. It's a form of revenge that could cause emotional harm to the ex's girlfriend, even if the author believes the ex deserved it. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author's action was a proportionate response. The ex's behavior was inappropriate, but the author's retaliation could be seen as crossing a line. The ex's girlfriend is an innocent party here, and involving her without a clear, respectful approach could be harmful. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to discuss such incidents with your partner and let them decide how to handle it. The author acted unilaterally, which upset his girlfriend, indicating that he overstepped. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while perhaps driven by a desire to protect his girlfriend, were not justified. He violated the ex's privacy, potentially caused harm to another person, and didn't respect his girlfriend's wishes. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
