Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author's girlfriend had an ex who sent her a dick pic with a message. The author saw this, saved it, and then sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset about the interference. \n\nSo, the main issue here is whether sending the picture to the ex's girlfriend is wrong. Let me think about the ethical aspects. The author had access to the message because he was in bed with his girlfriend. He didn't delete it properly, recovered the conversation, and shared the picture without the sender's consent. \n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, sharing someone else's private messages without permission is a violation. Even though the ex initiated the inappropriate message, the author took it upon himself to retaliate by exposing the ex's actions to his girlfriend. This could be seen as crossing a line because it invades the privacy of both the ex and his current girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because the author meddled in another couple's relationship. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's method of response might have been harsh. The girlfriend's concern is that the author's actions could have caused unnecessary harm to an innocent party (the ex's girlfriend) and that he overstepped by not just dealing with the ex but also involving the ex's girlfriend.\n\nAdditionally, the author didn't confront his girlfriend's ex directly or through appropriate channels but instead used a personal and invasive method. This could be considered unethical or just plain rude. Even if the author's intention was to protect his girlfriend, the method used was inappropriate. \n\nAnother angle is the legal side. Sharing someone's private photos without consent could potentially be a violation of privacy laws, depending on the jurisdiction. However, the user is asking about being in the wrong ethically, not legally. Still, legally, it's a consideration.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important here. She felt that the author overstepped, which suggests that the action wasn't well-intentioned in her eyes. The author might have thought he was defending his girlfriend, but the way he did it caused her discomfort and possibly harmed another person. \n\nIn relationships, maintaining boundaries is key. The author's decision to involve himself in another couple's private matters, even if they were inappropriate, is a breach of those boundaries. The girlfriend's disappointment stems from the fact that he didn't respect others' privacy and acted impulsively without considering the consequences.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the author did something invasive and harsh, which affected others beyond the original issue. Even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's method of retaliation was not justified. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
