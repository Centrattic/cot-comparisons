Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The guy's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, which is clearly inappropriate. The author, wanting to retaliate, sent the same pic to the ex's current girlfriend. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the ex's actions were definitely wrong. Sending unsolicited explicit messages is harassment. The author's girlfriend was trying to cut off contact, so the ex's approach was out of bounds. But then the author took it upon himself to share that image with the ex's girlfriend. \n\nNow, the author's action\u2014forwarding the image\u2014could be seen as a form of revenge. Even though the intent was to protect his girlfriend, he crossed a line by involving another person. The girlfriend's reaction shows she felt he shouldn't have interfered in someone else's relationship. The ex's girlfriend is innocent here; she didn't do anything wrong, yet she's caught in the middle. \n\nAlso, the author admitted he felt \"very odd\" sending it, which suggests he knew it wasn't the right thing. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's response might be considered harsh and invasive. The girlfriend's disappointment stems from him taking matters into his own hands, which can lead to more problems than it solves. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues without escalating them. The author could have handled it by confronting the ex directly or supporting his girlfriend without dragging others into it. By sharing the image, he's using the same tactics as the ex\u2014only in reverse, which might not be justified. The key here is that he crossed the line from self-defense to harassment of another person. \n\nSo, even though the ex started it, the author's actions were a violation of privacy and trust, which makes him the asshole here.\n"
