Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend received a dick pic from her ex, who had already been dumped a year ago. The author saw this, kept the conversation, and then sent the same picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is now upset with the author for interfering. The question is whether the author is an asshole here.\n\nFirst, the ex sending the picture is definitely inappropriate and crossing a boundary, especially since the ex had already been cut off. The author's reaction was to forward the image to the ex's girlfriend. Now, is that justified? Well, revenge might feel good, but there's a line between getting revenge and being an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are: the author took it upon themselves to retaliate without the girlfriend's consent. Even though the girlfriend found it funny later, she was initially angry because the author interfered in another couple's relationship. The author used a private, explicit image without the sender's permission and shared it with the ex's girlfriend. That's a privacy violation. Also, sending someone else's explicit image without their consent is generally considered a big no-no, even if it's in retaliation. It could lead to serious consequences for the ex, but the method used here might not be the right approach.\n\nThe author might have thought they were protecting their girlfriend, but forwarding such a message is not an appropriate response. It's more about personal retaliation and could backfire. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because the author didn't handle it in a mature way. Instead of confronting the ex directly or advising the girlfriend to block him, the author chose a confrontational and invasive method that affects another person's relationship. This could be seen as crossing a line, even if the original action by the ex was wrong.\n\nSo, even though the ex was at fault for sending the picture, the author's action of forwarding it without consent is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
