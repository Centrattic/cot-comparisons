Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author sending a dick pic from a mutual ex to his girlfriend's ex's current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The ex sent a dick pic to the author's girlfriend with a sarcastic message. The author, without the girlfriend's consent, took the photo, sent it to the ex's girlfriend, and justified it by saying he wanted to hurt the ex. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship and was harsh to an innocent person.\n\nThe main issue here is the author's actions. Even though the ex initiated the harassment, the author escalated the situation by retaliating without the girlfriend's permission. He used the ex's girlfriend as a means to hurt him, which is a form of third-degree retaliation. While the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response crossed a line into cyberbullying. Sending explicit content without consent invades someone else's privacy and can cause emotional distress. The author also didn't consider the potential consequences for the ex's girlfriend, who wasn't involved in the original conflict. Even if the author's intention was to protect his girlfriend, the method was inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction highlights that respecting boundaries is crucial. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
