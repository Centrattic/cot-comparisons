Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending the ex's dick pic to the ex's girlfriend. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a suggestive message. The author saw this, took a screenshot, and sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship, even though she found it funny later.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The ex's actions were inappropriate, but the author's response involved doxxing the ex by sending the pic to his girlfriend. The author might be thinking of getting revenge or teaching the ex a lesson, but the method involves another person's privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because the author didn't just retaliate against the ex but also involved the ex's girlfriend. Even if the author thought it was justified, sending someone else's private message to their partner is a violation of privacy. It's similar to spreading someone's personal content without consent, which is generally considered wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling bad about being harsh towards the innocent girl. That shows some self-awareness, but the action still crossed a line. The girlfriend's ex did something wrong, but the author's response escalated the situation in a way that's not constructive. The main issue here is the invasion of privacy of the ex's girlfriend. \n\nEven if the author's intention was to hurt the ex, using the girlfriend as a means to do so is problematic. It's not just about the ex's actions, but how the author chose to respond. The author's action could cause harm to the ex's relationship, which he isn't directly involved in. The girlfriend's disappointment is about the author overstepping by interfering in another couple's affairs. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the ex's behavior was unacceptable, the author's response is a form of payback that's likely to cause more harm than good. It's not about whether the ex deserved it, but about the moral responsibility of the author to not escalate the conflict in a harmful way. The author could have addressed the issue by confronting the ex or blocking him, but sending the picture to the girlfriend is a step too far. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he violated the privacy of another person and potentially caused harm to a relationship that he shouldn't have meddled in. The answer should be A.\n"
