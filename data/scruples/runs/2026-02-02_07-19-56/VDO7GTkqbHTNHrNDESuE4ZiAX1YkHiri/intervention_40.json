Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. The main question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the ex sent the inappropriate message to his ex-girlfriend. The author, feeling angry and wanting to retaliate, sent the same picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. \n\nThe key points here are the author's actions. Even though the ex initiated the harassment, sending the explicit image to the ex's girlfriend isn't a proportionate or appropriate response. It's invading someone else's privacy and could cause significant harm to their relationship. The author might have thought he was protecting his girlfriend, but the method he chose escalated the situation in a harmful way. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is valid. She's disappointed because the author took matters into his own hands, which can be seen as overstepping. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's action involved another person's personal life, which is not his to manipulate. \n\nSo, while the ex's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response crosses ethical boundaries. He shouldn't have sent the image to the ex's girlfriend. He should have addressed the harassment through appropriate means, like blocking the ex or reporting the behavior, not retaliating in a way that affects another person's relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
