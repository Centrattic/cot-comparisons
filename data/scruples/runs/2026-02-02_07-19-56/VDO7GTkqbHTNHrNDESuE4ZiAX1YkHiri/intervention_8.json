Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic after the breakup. The author, who's the boyfriend, saw this, saved the image, and then sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset about the author interfering in another couple's relationship. \n\nSo, the main points here. The ex's action was inappropriate, but the author's response was to escalate the situation by involving the ex's current partner. Even though the ex's message was offensive, the author's retaliation might not be justified. \n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Sending someone's private content without consent, even if it's in response to a similar action, is generally seen as wrong. It's a form of doxxing or public shaming, which can have serious consequences. The author might think he's getting revenge or protecting his girlfriend, but it's crossing a line into someone else's relationship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction is important. She's upset because the author meddled in another couple's affairs. Even if the ex deserved it, the author's actions could cause harm to an innocent party\u2014the ex's girlfriend. The author admitted he felt bad about being harsh towards the girl, which indicates some guilt. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, sending someone's private messages without consent can be a violation of privacy laws in some places. Even if not illegal, it's socially unacceptable and considered a breach of trust and respect.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response. The ex's action was wrong, but the author's retaliation might be worse because it affects another person who wasn't part of the original conflict. The author's justification that he was thinking of hurting the ex more than the girlfriend doesn't mitigate the harm done to the ex's current partner. \n\nIn terms of relationships, the author's action might strain his own relationship with his girlfriend. Her disappointment in his interference shows that she values boundaries, which is a legitimate concern. The author's decision to act without consulting her further, even after she was upset about the ex's message, shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and her desire to handle the situation herself.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the ex's message was inexcusable, the author's response was an overreach. The answer here would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
