Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent the ex's dick pic to the ex's girlfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the man's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and he retaliated by forwarding it to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The main question is whether forwarding someone's private message without their consent is wrong. The ex sent the pic to the girlfriend, which was already inappropriate. The man then took the pic and sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The ex's girlfriend wasn't involved in the original interaction, so she's an innocent party here. \n\nThe man's girlfriend is upset because he involved another person's relationship. Even if the ex was at fault, retaliating by involving a third party might not be justified. The key points here are consent and privacy. The ex's girlfriend didn't ask to receive the pic, and the man didn't have the right to share it with her, even as a form of punishment for the ex's actions. \n\nAlso, the man's girlfriend is disappointed because he intervened in another couple's relationship. That could lead to potential fallout, like the ex's girlfriend being upset or the relationship being affected. The man might have thought he was defending his girlfriend, but the means he used were invasive and could be seen as unethical. \n\nEven though the ex initiated the inappropriate message, the man's response escalated the situation. Instead of dealing with the ex directly (like blocking him) or discussing it with his girlfriend, he chose a more aggressive approach that involved a third party. That's a breach of privacy for both the ex's girlfriend and the original ex. \n\nSo, the answer is A because the man violated the privacy of another person by forwarding a private message without consent, which is unethical regardless of the provocation. Even if the ex was wrong, the method of retaliation is inconsiderate and crosses a line.\n"
