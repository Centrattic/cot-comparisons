Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that his girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and he sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The question is whether his actions make him the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, the ex sent the inappropriate message. That's clearly wrong and disrespectful. But then the author took it a step further by forwarding the pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's main justification is that he wanted to hurt the ex by exposing him, but he also mentions feeling bad about involving the other girl.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship. Even though the ex was the one who initiated the inappropriate contact, the author's response was to escalate the situation by retaliating in a public way. Sending someone else's private message to their partner is a form of invasion of privacy and could be seen as a violation of trust and boundaries.\n\nThe author might argue that the ex deserved it for sending the message, but the act of forwarding it without consent could damage the ex's relationship. The girlfriend's concern is valid because he didn't handle it privately. Instead of confronting the ex directly or letting his girlfriend handle it, he took matters into his own hands in a way that could cause collateral damage to another person.\n\nAlso, the author took the picture without the girlfriend's consent. Even though she saw it and they laughed about it, he decided to send it to the ex's girlfriend on his own. That's overstepping his role as a partner. The girlfriend's disappointment likely stems from him not respecting her autonomy in dealing with her ex's actions.\n\nIn terms of ethics, retaliating with someone else's private messages is generally considered wrong, even if the original action was also wrong. It's a form of cyberbullying and can have serious consequences. The author's actions could be seen as an attempt to humiliate the ex in front of his current partner, which is not a constructive way to handle the situation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while understandable in terms of anger, go beyond what's acceptable. He violated privacy and potentially caused harm to another relationship, which makes him at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
