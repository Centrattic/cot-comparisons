Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending the ex's dick pic to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The author's girlfriend was sent a dick pic by her ex, which is clearly inappropriate. The author forwards it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship. The author justifies it by saying the ex initiated it, but the action still caused potential harm.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Deliberately sharing someone else's private and possibly intimate content without consent is generally a violation of privacy. Even if the sender was a jerk, the author took it a step further by using that content to possibly disrupt another relationship. The girlfriend's main complaint is about the interference, which the author did intentionally. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The ex's girlfriend wasn't involved in the original interaction, so receiving that image without her consent is a separate issue. The author might have thought he was getting back at the ex, but the method could be seen as malicious and could cause harm to an innocent party. \n\nEven though the author might have thought it was justified or even justified it by the ex's actions, the act of forwarding the image without the ex's consent and without considering the other person's feelings is problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because it's meddling in another couple's affairs. \n\nSo, the key points are privacy violation, lack of consent, and interfering in another relationship. All these factors point towards the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
