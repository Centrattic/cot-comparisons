Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a suggestive message. The author saw this, was angry, and then sent the same picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's main justification is that the ex initiated the harassment by sending the picture, so they wanted to retaliate. The girlfriend is upset that the author involved himself in another couple's relationship.\n\nNow, considering the actions. Sending someone else's private content, even if it's a dick pic, is a breach of privacy. The author took it upon himself to forward the picture to the ex's girlfriend without her consent. Even though the ex was the one who sent the picture, the author's action of forwarding it without the recipient's permission is questionable. Privacy laws in many places consider sharing someone's private messages without consent as a violation, especially if it's non-consensual in the first place.\n\nAlso, the author's intention was to hurt the ex, but the collateral effect is that the current girlfriend of the ex is now involved. The author admitted that the girlfriend is upset about the author interfering in another relationship. The author's action could have serious consequences for the ex's current relationship, which wasn't their place to meddle in. \n\nEven if the ex's actions were inappropriate, the author's response was to escalate the situation rather than address it through appropriate channels. The proper course of action would be to block the ex, report the harassment, or confront the ex directly, not to retaliate by exposing the ex's actions to his girlfriend in such a public way.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she values boundaries and doesn't want her partner interfering in others' relationships. The author's action, while perhaps understandable in terms of anger, crosses a line by involving another person's privacy. The fact that the author felt it was necessary to forward the picture to \"teach the guy a lesson\" shows a lack of respect for others' privacy and relationships.\n\nIn summary, while the ex's actions were inexcusable, the author's response was not justified. The author violated privacy and meddled in another relationship, which is the wrong approach. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
