Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's girlfriend got a dick pic from her ex, who was already bitter about the breakup. The author saw it, saved it, and then sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is now upset with the author for interfering.\n\nHmm. The main question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's think about the key points here. The ex sent an inappropriate message to his ex, which the author found out about. The author's intent was to hurt the ex by exposing him to his current girlfriend. But the author also sent the picture to the ex's girlfriend without her knowledge, which could be seen as a violation of privacy.\n\nOn one hand, the ex's actions were definitely inconsiderate and possibly crossing a line by sending a dick pic to his ex. The author might feel justified in wanting to retaliate. But the method used\u2014forwarding the image to the current girlfriend\u2014could have serious consequences. Even if the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response might escalate things unnecessarily. The author's girlfriend is upset because he meddled in another relationship, which raises the issue of consent and overstepping boundaries.\n\nAlso, sending someone's private message without their permission, even if it's to expose them, is generally considered a privacy violation. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing by protecting his girlfriend and retaliating against the ex, but the means he used could be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction highlights that she felt he shouldn't have interfered, which suggests that he might have overreacted.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions feeling bad about being harsh towards the ex's girlfriend. That shows some guilt, which could indicate that he recognizes the potential wrongness of his actions. The act of forwarding the message without explaining or giving the ex's girlfriend a choice is a key point here. It's possible that the ex's girlfriend might not have appreciated the message, even if the ex's actions were wrong. The author's approach was direct and confrontational, which might not be the best way to handle such a situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the ex's behavior was clearly inappropriate, the author's response could be seen as a tit-for-tat that doesn't address the root issue and instead causes more harm. The best approach might have been to confront the ex directly or involve the girlfriend in deciding how to handle the situation, rather than taking unilateral action.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while understandable in terms of protecting his girlfriend, cross into territory where he's invading another person's privacy and potentially ruining someone else's relationship without their consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he acted without considering the broader consequences and violated privacy boundaries.\n"
