Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that his girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and he sent the same picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's actions were in response to his girlfriend's ex's inappropriate behavior. The ex sent a sexual image with a suggestive message, which is clearly not okay. The author sent the image to the ex's girlfriend to expose the ex's actions. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main question is whether retaliating by forwarding the image to the ex's girlfriend is justified. On one hand, the ex initiated the harassment, so the author might feel justified in wanting to protect his girlfriend and teach the ex a lesson. But on the other hand, forwarding private, explicit content without consent is a violation of privacy. The author's action could be seen as revenge and might cause harm to the ex's girlfriend, even if unintended. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in another relationship. While the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response could be considered overstepping. By sending the image to the ex's girlfriend, he's using the same inappropriate method he condemned. This might lead to further conflict and could damage the ex's girlfriend emotionally. The author might have intended to help his girlfriend, but his method could be seen as unkind and invasive.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. In some places, sharing someone's explicit images without consent is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the author felt wronged, the act of forwarding the image could have legal consequences. Ethically, it's about respecting others' privacy and autonomy. Even if the ex is at fault, the author's action doesn't resolve the issue constructively. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a clue. She's disappointed in the author for interfering, which suggests that she believes it's not his place to act on her behalf in that way. Her point about not being \"in your face\" indicates she preferred a different approach, maybe a direct confrontation with the ex or reporting the behavior through appropriate channels. \n\nIn conclusion, while the ex's actions were definitely wrong, the author's response of forwarding the image to the ex's girlfriend crosses a line. It's an invasion of privacy and escalates the conflict rather than resolving it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
