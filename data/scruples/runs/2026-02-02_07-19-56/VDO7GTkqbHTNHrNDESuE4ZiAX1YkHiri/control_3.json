Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy's girlfriend received a dick pic from her ex, who's already been cut off. The guy then sent the same pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another couple's relationship. \n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author act unethically or inconsiderately? Well, the ex sent the inappropriate message to his ex-girlfriend, which was wrong. The author's response was to retaliate by sending the pic to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nNow, while the ex's action was clearly inappropriate, the author's response might be crossing a line. By sending the dick pic to the girlfriend, the author is invading the privacy of another couple. Even if the intention was to teach the ex a lesson, using the girlfriend's privacy as a tool could be seen as harsh and unethical. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she didn't like being involved in someone else's drama. The author's action could potentially cause harm to the other couple, even if it was in response to their ex's actions. The author might have thought he was doing the right thing by protecting his partner, but the method used could have repercussions beyond just the ex. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling bad about being harsh towards the innocent girl, which indicates some level of awareness that the action might not be justified. The fact that the girlfriend is still annoyed, even if she found it funny later, shows that there's a conflict in their views on the approach. \n\nIn relationships, respecting boundaries is important. The author's action involved another person's private information without consent, which is generally frowned upon. Even if the ex was at fault, the response doesn't resolve the issue constructively and instead escalates it by involving the ex's partner. \n\nSo putting it all together, while the ex's actions were terrible, the author's retaliation might be considered in the wrong because it's interfering in another relationship and using private information in a way that's not respectful. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
