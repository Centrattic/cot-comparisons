Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, let's consider the situation. The ex sent a dick pic to the author's girlfriend. The author, seeing this, saves the image and then forwards it to the ex's current girlfriend. The main issue here is about privacy and consent. The ex didn't have the right to send the picture in the first place, but the author took it a step further by sharing it without the ex's consent.\n\nEven if the ex's action was inconsiderate, the author's response involved exposing someone else's private content. The ex's girlfriend received the picture without her consent, which is a violation of her privacy. The author might have intended to retaliate, but forwarding private messages or images, regardless of the context, is generally not acceptable. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in another couple's relationship. While the ex's actions were clearly wrong, the author's method of retaliation could cause unnecessary harm. The key point is that sharing someone's private content without their permission is a breach of trust and can have serious consequences, even if the original sender was at fault. \n\nAdditionally, the author's motive was to hurt the ex more, but using the ex's girlfriend as a third party in this way is not justified. It's possible that the ex's girlfriend didn't even know about the prior relationship dynamics, so she was put in an uncomfortable position without context. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the action of sharing private messages without consent is typically considered wrong, regardless of the initial provocation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
