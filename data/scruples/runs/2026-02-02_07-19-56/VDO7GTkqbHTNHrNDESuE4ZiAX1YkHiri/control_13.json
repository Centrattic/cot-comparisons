Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend broke up with her ex, who is now bitter. The ex sent a dick pic to the girlfriend, and the author, wanting to retaliate, sent that same picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in another relationship. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex's action (sending a dick pic) was inappropriate, and the author's response (forwarding it to the girlfriend) is being questioned. \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Even if the ex initiated this by sending the photo, the author took a proactive step to involve another person's relationship. The question is whether this action was justified or if it crosses a line. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, sharing such a private image without consent could be considered revenge porn, which is illegal in many places. But since this is more about moral judgment (AITA), I should focus on that. \n\nThe author's intent was to hurt the ex, which is understandable given the situation. However, involving the ex's girlfriend by sending her that image is a third-party action. The author's girlfriend is upset because he didn't handle it privately. The author might argue self-defense or retaliation, but the method of retaliation affects someone else's relationship, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the author sent the photo without the ex's girlfriend's consent. Even if the author had the ex's photo, forwarding it to her girlfriend is invasive and could be seen as a violation of privacy. The author is taking the privacy breach that the ex committed and replicating it to another person. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is interfering in a relationship that isn't their own. While the ex started it, the author's response isn't the appropriate way to address it. The correct course of action might have been to confront the ex directly or report the behavior, not to escalate it by involving the ex's girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is important too. She's upset because the author took it upon himself to act, which she sees as overstepping. Even if the author thought it was justified, the method was harsh and invasive. \n\nSo, putting it all together: while the ex's actions were clearly wrong, the author's response of sending the photo to the ex's girlfriend is an invasion of privacy and could damage another relationship. This makes the author responsible for the potential fallout beyond just the initial issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
