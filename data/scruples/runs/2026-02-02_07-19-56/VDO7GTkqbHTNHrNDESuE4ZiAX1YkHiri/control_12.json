Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and he sent it to the ex's girlfriend. The author says he felt bad about being harsh to the girl, but his main intention was to hurt the guy. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions. The guy sent a private, explicit message from another person without consent. Even if it's a dick pic, which is generally not a protected content like other explicit material, sending someone else's private messages without permission is a breach of privacy. The author took a conversation where the ex sent the pic, saved it, and then sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. That's forwarding someone else's personal content without consent. \n\nThe ex's actions were wrong for sending the pic to an ex, but the author's response might be excessive. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. The key points here are consent and the method of confrontation. The author didn't just tell the girlfriend's ex what he did; he sent the actual explicit content to the girlfriend. That's more aggressive. Even if the author thought it was justified, there's a line about how you handle someone else's mistakes. \n\nThe author's girlfriend is upset because he involved himself too much. The question is whether the author overstepped. Sending the pic to the ex's girlfriend could be seen as using someone else's private content to humiliate another person. Even if the ex did something wrong, the author's method of retaliation might not be appropriate. \n\nSo, considering privacy, consent, and the proportionality of the response, the author likely did something wrong. He shouldn't have forwarded the content without consent, regardless of the reason. The answer is probably A, Yes.\n"
