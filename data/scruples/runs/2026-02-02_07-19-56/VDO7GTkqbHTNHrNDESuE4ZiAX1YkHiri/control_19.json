Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the ex sent the dick pic to the girlfriend, which is inappropriate. The author then forwards it to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in someone else's relationship. \n\nThe key points here are: the author took a private message from one person (the ex) and shared it with another (the ex's girlfriend) without consent. Even if the ex initiated the inappropriate message, the author's action of forwarding the image is a violation of privacy for both the ex and his girlfriend. The girlfriend might be upset because the author acted on his own without consulting her, which could lead to unintended consequences like breaking up the ex's relationship. \n\nAlso, sending someone's private content without permission is generally considered unethical and possibly illegal in some places. Even if the author's intention was to retaliate, the action still crosses a line. The fact that the girlfriend is upset about his interference suggests that it's not acceptable to her. \n\nSo, considering privacy violations and unauthorized sharing of personal content, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
