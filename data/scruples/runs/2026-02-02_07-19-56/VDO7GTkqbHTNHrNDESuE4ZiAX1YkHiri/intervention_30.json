Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the situation step by step. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a message. The author, the guy in the situation, saw this and decided to forward the picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset with the author because he interfered in another couple's relationship. The author feels like he was justified because the ex initiated the harassment.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The ex's actions were definitely inappropriate\u2014sending a dick pic to an ex with a suggestive message. That's crossing a line. But the author's response was to forward that same inappropriate content to the ex's girlfriend. Even though the author might have been trying to teach the ex a lesson, forwarding someone else's private and potentially explicit content without consent is a violation of privacy. It's like, if someone does something wrong, you don't respond by violating someone else's privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he involved another couple's relationship. The author might have thought it was a way to make the ex feel the consequences, but forwarding the pic to his girlfriend is not a proportionate response. It's also possible that the ex's girlfriend might feel violated, even if she later realizes the context. The author acknowledges that he feels bad for being harsh towards her, which shows he recognizes some fault. \n\nAlso, the author should have considered the consequences. He might have assumed the girlfriend would appreciate the action, but relationships involve trust and boundaries. Interfering in another couple's issues, even if you think it's justified, can have repercussions beyond what you anticipate. The girlfriend's main issue is that he acted without her consent and overstepped by involving another person.\n\nSo, even though the ex was in the wrong, the author's method of retaliation was inappropriate. It's not right to respond to harassment by committing a similar violation of privacy on another person. The author should have talked to his girlfriend about it and perhaps let her handle it, or maybe reported the ex's behavior in a more appropriate way. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for sending the picture to the ex's girlfriend.\n"
