Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author sent a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's girlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago, and the ex has been sending her inappropriate messages. The author saw one such message, saved it, and then sent it to the ex's new girlfriend. His girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. \n\nNow, considering the actions: forwarding someone else's private content without consent is generally a breach of privacy. Even if the original message was inappropriate, the author took it a step further by sharing it. The ex's new girlfriend wasn't part of the original issue, so the author's action could be seen as malicious. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation was to hurt the ex, which might justify it in their eyes, but it's still an invasion of privacy for the new girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014being upset about the interference\u2014adds another layer. \n\nEthically, even if the ex was in the wrong, the author's method of retaliation isn't considered appropriate. It's common for people to think they're justified in revenge, but forwarding private messages is usually seen as a violation. \n\nSo, while the ex's actions were clearly wrong, the author took it too far by involving another person. The answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because forwarding private content without consent is a violation, regardless of the initial provocation.\n"
