Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that his girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and the author sent that pic to the ex's new girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the ex's actions were definitely inappropriate and creepy. Sending a dick pic with a message like \"Miss you, do you miss this?\" after a breakup is a clear violation of boundaries. The ex was being disrespectful towards both his ex and the author's girlfriend.\n\nNow, the author saw this message and decided to take action. He didn't just delete it or let it go. Instead, he took the image, sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he interfered in someone else's relationship, even though the ex was the one who acted inappropriately. \n\nThe key points here are about the author's response. While the ex's behavior is inexcusable, does retaliating by exposing the ex's actions to his girlfriend cross a line? The author mentions he feels bad about being harsh towards the ex's girlfriend. He intended to hurt the guy more than her, but the method involved involving an innocent third party. \n\nEven if the ex was at fault, sending private messages to someone else's partner without their consent is a violation of privacy. The author might have thought he was protecting his girlfriend's feelings, but by forwarding the image, he's taking matters into his own hands. This could potentially damage another relationship unnecessarily. The girlfriend's reaction that he was too harsh and interfered too much makes sense because it's not his place to mediate someone else's relationship issues. \n\nThere could have been other ways to handle it, like confronting the ex or reporting the message to WhatsApp. By sending the image to the girlfriend, he's using the same kind of public shaming tactic that the ex used, which is hypocritical and might escalate the situation. \n\nSo, even though the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response was an overreach. He didn't have the right to involve the ex's girlfriend in this way. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
