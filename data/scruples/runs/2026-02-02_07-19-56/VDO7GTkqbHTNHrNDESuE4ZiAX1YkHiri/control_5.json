Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who sent the ex's dick pic to the ex's girlfriend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a suggestive message. The author saw it, was angry, and then sent the pic to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because he got involved in another couple's relationship.\n\nSo, the main ethical questions here are about privacy and respect. The ex sent the pic to his ex, which is already inappropriate. The author then took it upon himself to retaliate by sharing it with the ex's girlfriend. While the ex's action was wrong, the author's response might cross a line. \n\nBy sending the pic to the ex's girlfriend, the author is violating the ex's privacy and possibly the girlfriend's without consent. Even if the author's intention was to teach the ex a lesson, the method used is invasive and could cause harm to both the ex's relationship and the girlfriend's trust. The author's girlfriend is upset because he interfered, which suggests that this action was overstepping.\n\nAlso, the author admitted to feeling bad about being harsh towards the girlfriend. This indicates he recognizes some wrongdoing. The key point here is that while the ex's behavior was inappropriate, the author's response was not a proportionate or respectful way to address it. \n\nIn relationships, respecting boundaries is crucial. The author's actions might have been driven by anger and a desire for revenge, but they crossed into another person's privacy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
