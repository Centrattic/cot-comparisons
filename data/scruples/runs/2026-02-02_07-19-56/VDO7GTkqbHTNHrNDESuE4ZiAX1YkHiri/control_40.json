Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the ex sent the girlfriend a dick pic with a suggestive message. The author saw this, didn't like it, and sent the same pic to the ex's girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because he got involved in someone else's relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's actions were a direct retaliation. He took something private and shared it without consent. Even if the ex started it, that doesn't necessarily justify the response. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nEthically, sending someone else's private messages, especially something explicit, without their permission is a big no-no. It invades the privacy of both the ex and his girlfriend. The author might have felt justified because the ex sent the pic, but using that to send it to the girlfriend is another step. Even if the intention was to hurt the ex more, the method was invasive and could have serious consequences for the girlfriend, who was not the one who sent the pic. She's the innocent party here, and the author's action could have damaged her relationship without her knowing the full context. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction shows she felt it was a harsh move. The author didn't consider the potential fallout for the ex's girlfriend. While the ex was clearly in the wrong, the author's response escalated the situation in a way that's not acceptable. It's not just about the initial act but also about the consequences and the ethical implications of his retaliation. \n\nSo, even if the ex started it, the author's action was an invasion of privacy and meddling in another relationship, which is wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
