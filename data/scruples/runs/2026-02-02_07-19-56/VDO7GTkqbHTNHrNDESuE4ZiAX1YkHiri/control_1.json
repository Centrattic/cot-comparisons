Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending his girlfriend's ex's dick pic to the ex's current girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The ex sent a dick pic to his ex-girlfriend (now the author's girlfriend) with a suggestive message. The author saw this, saved the pic, and then sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. His girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship.\n\nSo, the main points here are about privacy, consent, and the appropriateness of the action. The ex's message was inappropriate, but the author's response was to retaliate by sharing the picture with the ex's girlfriend. Even if the ex initiated it, forwarding the image without consent is a violation of privacy. The author might think he was standing up for his girlfriend, but using someone else's private content without their permission is generally considered wrong. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she didn't appreciate him getting involved. Even if the ex was the one who sent the inappropriate message, the author's action could be seen as escalating the situation and invading the privacy of the ex's partner. The act of sending the picture could harm the ex's relationship, but it's still a breach of trust and privacy. \n\nIn many contexts, sharing someone's private content without consent is a clear violation. The author may have intended to teach the ex a lesson, but the method was inappropriate. The fact that he felt \"harsh\" towards the innocent girl indicates that the action might not have been justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because forwarding the image without consent breaches privacy and is a form of harassment, even if the original message was the ex's fault.\n"
