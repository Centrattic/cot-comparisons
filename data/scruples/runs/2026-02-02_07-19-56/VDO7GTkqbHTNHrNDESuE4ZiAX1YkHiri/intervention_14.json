Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic with a suggestive message. The author saw it, didn't like it, and then sent the same image to the ex's current girlfriend. The author's girlfriend is upset because they interfered in another couple's relationship. The author feels they were justified because the ex initiated the bad behavior.\n\nHmm. Let's think about the key points. The ex sent an inappropriate message to the author's girlfriend. The author's reaction was to retaliate by sending the same image to the ex's girlfriend. The author justifies it by saying the ex started it, but the girlfriend is upset about the invasion of privacy and interference.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the ex's actions were definitely inappropriate and invasive. But the author's response\u2014forwarding the image to the ex's girlfriend\u2014could be seen as a breach of privacy. The author didn't just confront the ex but went a step further by involving his girlfriend, which might have caused unnecessary harm. The girlfriend's reaction that it was harsh makes sense because it's meddling in another couple's affairs. Even if the ex was at fault, the author's action escalates the conflict and could lead to more issues for the other couple. The author might have intended to hurt the ex, but using the girlfriend as a pawn could be seen as mean-spirited. The line between justice and revenge can be thin here. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the ex's behavior was bad, but the method of response is questionable. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the invasion of privacy and meddling, the answer leans toward yes. So, the answer is A.\n"
