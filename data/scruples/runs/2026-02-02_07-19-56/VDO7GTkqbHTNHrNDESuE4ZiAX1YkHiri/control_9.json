Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's girlfriend's ex sent her a dick pic, and the author sent the picture to the ex's current girlfriend. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about privacy, consent, and the appropriateness of the actions taken. The ex sent a nude image to his ex-girlfriend, which is a violation of boundaries. The author, upon seeing this, took the picture and sent it to the ex's current girlfriend. \n\nThe main issues here are: Did the author have the right to forward the image without consent? Even though the ex sent it to the author's girlfriend, forwarding it to his girlfriend is a privacy issue. The current girlfriend wasn't involved in the initial interaction, so she's a third party here. The author is using someone else's private content, which is a form of harassment, even if it's a retaliatory action. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is upset because the author interfered in another couple's relationship. The author's action might be considered an invasion of privacy for both the ex and his girlfriend. The act of forwarding a nude without consent can be seen as a breach of trust and can cause harm, regardless of the original context.\n\nIn terms of consent, the author didn't get permission from his girlfriend to forward the image, nor did he get permission from the ex to share it with his girlfriend. Even if the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response is equally problematic because it's a private matter. The author may have thought he was getting revenge or protecting his girlfriend, but sharing someone's private content without consent is generally considered a wrong action.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt the author overstepped his bounds. She's upset because he involved himself in another couple's affairs. This suggests that the author's actions were not considered appropriate by his own partner, which is a red flag.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author is likely in the wrong because he shared private content without consent, even if the initial act by the ex was inappropriate. The author's action is a form of retaliation that invades the privacy of others and could be considered harassment. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
