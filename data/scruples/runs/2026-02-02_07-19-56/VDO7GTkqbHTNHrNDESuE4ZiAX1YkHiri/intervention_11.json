Title says it all but I will elaborate. I am 26M, girlfirend is 24F and her ex is 24M.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nGirlfriend broke up with her ex a year ago and started dating me shortly after (two months later). He was incredibly bitter about it all which is understandable, but she cut of all contact with him as soon as she dumped him. He's tried to message her over and over again, so I kept a close eye on him since I really dislike the guy - he was a shit bf as far as I know. I saw he has a girlfriend now for about three months.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nLast night, this guy decided to send my girlfriend a dick pic on WhatsApp (the one place she hadn't blocked him) with the caption \"Miss you, do you miss this?\". Idiot didn't realise I was lying in bed with my gf and saw the whole thing and we had a good laugh about it but it really pissed me off. Girlfriend ignored it, but I couldn't. She closed the conversation but didn't delete it, so when she went to shower later on, I recovered the conversation, sent the dick pic to myself (felt very odd doing that), and properly deleted the convo. I let her block him herself later lol.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI then sent the dick pic to this guy's girlfriend, and told her he'd send it to his ex which is my girlfriend. I could only find her on Facebook so I sent it through Messenger, and I know she's \"seen\" it. As soon as my girlfriend was out of the shower I told her what I'd done and she's pretty pissed off with me, saying I shouldn't get involved in anyone else's relationship and I could possibly have ended their relationship. I told her he did that himself by sending the picture in the first place. After an hour or so, she calmed down and agreed it was hilarious however I can tell she's still a tiny but annoyed at me by the way she's acting lol so I have come to you guys! I think she's mostly disappointed I interfered in this guy's relationship more than anything, because she said she can't believe I'd be so harsh to the poor girl and I could have told her in a nicer way and not be so \"in your face\" about it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I an asshole for what I did?  I do feel bad for being harsh towards this innocent girl, but I was mostly thinking about hurting the guy more than her.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending a dick pic from his girlfriend's ex to the ex's girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the ex sent a dick pic to the author's girlfriend. That's clearly inappropriate and invasive. The author saw it, which he had a right to since he was lying in bed with his girlfriend. He might have felt justified in wanting to retaliate.\n\nBut then he sent the picture to the ex's girlfriend. Now, the ex's girlfriend is an innocent party here. The author's intention was to hurt the ex, which is understandable given the ex's behavior. However, involving the ex's girlfriend by showing her the inappropriate image is where the problem arises. \n\nEven if the author thought it was a way to teach the ex a lesson, he had no right to expose the ex's private content to someone else. The ex's girlfriend might feel violated, even if the ex initiated the inappropriate behavior. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of privacy for both the ex and his girlfriend. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset because he interfered in another relationship. The author might have overstepped by not just confronting the ex but also involving his girlfriend. Even if the ex was at fault, the method of retaliation was harsh and potentially harmful to an innocent person. \n\nSo, while the ex's actions were wrong, the author's response was not justified. He should have focused on protecting his own relationship without escalating the conflict in a way that could hurt others. The key point is that the author shouldn't have shared the private content with the ex's girlfriend, making him the asshole in this situation.\n"
