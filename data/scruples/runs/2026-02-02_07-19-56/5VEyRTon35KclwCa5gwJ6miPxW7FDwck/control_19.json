In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the details. The author works in IT and tried to stay professional. A new female coworker joined, and he helped her onboarding. He was friendly, like with others. The girl was a recent college grad and there was an age gap. She told him she loves him in the first week. He responded that it's just infatuation. She started crying. He then kept communication minimal and professional, but this made her cry more.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, she professed her love again in public. He shut her down, which caused her to have a fit. He took her home and during the ride, she cried and screamed. He stayed silent and turned up the radio each time she got emotional. Dropped her off without apologizing. Later, she moved on to another guy.\n\nThe question is whether he was an asshole for not consoling her. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, consider the context. He maintained professionalism from the start. The girl had a crush, which isn't uncommon in workplaces. His initial response was to explain it's infatuation. Then he distanced himself to keep it professional. When she made a public confession, he rejected her again, which led to her emotional breakdown. The key point is whether he should have consoled her during or after the incident.\n\nIn the ride home, he chose silence and increased the radio instead of comforting her. In some cases, people might expect some level of empathy, even if he's not interested. But he might argue that he was trying to avoid further emotional distress and keep the situation under control. However, not consoling someone who's clearly upset could be seen as cold or heartless. The question is about whether his actions were inconsiderate or unkind, even if he's not responsible for her feelings.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. While he maintained professionalism, his response to her emotional state could be seen as lacking compassion. Even if he's not responsible for her feelings, a more empathetic approach might have been better, like acknowledging her emotions without reciprocating. However, some might argue that he was in his right to set boundaries and not engage further. The fact that she moved on quickly might suggest that he's not the sole cause of her distress, but that doesn't negate the need for some level of compassion.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the expectation is to show some empathy during her emotional breakdown, then yes. But if the expectation is to keep it strictly professional and not have to console someone he's not romantically interested in, then no. It's a bit of a grey area. In AITA contexts, often the expectation is that even if someone's actions are justified, they should consider the other person's feelings. So maybe he's an asshole for not at least trying to console her, even if he's not romantically interested. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But others may say B. I need to weigh the pros and cons. The key is whether not consoling her was the asshole move. Since she was crying and he didn't respond, even if he's not responsible, he could have been kinder. So, AITA would likely say he's in the wrong (A).\n"
