In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The scenario involves the author rejecting the coworker's advances and not offering comfort during emotional outbursts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author helped onboard a new female coworker, which is a professional duty. The coworker, being new and a few years younger, expressed love immediately, which the author dismissed as infatuation. The author then distanced themselves professionally, leading to the coworker's emotional episodes. During a team-building hike, the coworker made another public declaration, which the author shut down, leading to more crying. The author didn't console her, instead increasing the radio volume and dropping her off without further interaction.\n\nNow, the key points here are professionalism, empathy, and workplace conduct. In a professional setting, it's important to handle such situations with care. The author's initial response was to distance themselves, which is understandable to avoid personal conflicts. However, when the coworker is clearly emotional, there's a responsibility to prevent further distress, especially in a public team-building event. \n\nThe author's actions during the ride\u2014ignoring her cries, not offering any comfort, and using the radio to drown out her emotions\u2014could be seen as lacking empathy. Even if the author didn't want to engage in a relationship, responding with compassion is expected. The fact that the coworker \"got over it\" quickly doesn't negate the author's responsibility to handle the situation professionally and humanely.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky, but public emotional outbursts can affect team dynamics and morale. The author's silence and lack of support might be perceived as cruel or dismissive, even if their intention was to maintain boundaries. The question is whether not consoling her was appropriate. Since empathy is generally a valued trait in professional interactions, especially when someone is visibly distressed, the author might be considered in the wrong for not at least attempting to console her, even if they maintained professional distance otherwise.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they failed to provide necessary emotional support in a situation where the coworker was clearly upset, even if the initial rejection was handled professionally.\n"
