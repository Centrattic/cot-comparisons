In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation started when the girl, new to the company, declared her love, and the author rejected her, causing her to cry. The author then became more distant, which led to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she tried to profess her love again publicly, and the author shut her down, leading to a breakdown. The author didn't console her during the ride home, even turning up the radio to avoid conversation.\n\nFirst, consider the work environment. It's important to maintain professionalism. The author did help her initially, but the girl's actions were unprofessional. Declaring love at work is not appropriate, so the author's rejection was necessary. However, the way they handled it might be an issue. When she started crying, the author kept distance and didn't console her. While maintaining boundaries is important, completely ignoring someone in distress could be seen as harsh. The author could have been more empathetic while still keeping things professional. For example, acknowledging her feelings without engaging further. \n\nThen there's the hike incident. She tried to confess again publicly, which could be embarrassing for both. The author's response was to shut her down, which might have been necessary, but the ride home was filled with her crying and the author not responding. Turning up the radio instead of offering any support might come across as uncaring, even if the author felt it was the right approach. While the author isn't to blame for the girl's actions, their lack of empathy in handling her emotional state could be seen as wrong. The fact that the girl moved on quickly suggests she's fine, but the author's actions during her breakdown might still be problematic. So, there's a balance between professionalism and empathy here. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, but the way they handled the emotional fallout could be where they erred. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
