In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person who helped onboard a new female colleague who had a crush on them. The author rejected her advances, which led her to cry, and then during a hike, the author didn't console her when she was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was professional and tried to be friendly initially. The new employee had a crush and expressed her feelings, which the author dismissed as infatuation. Then, when she tried again publicly, the author shut her down and didn't comfort her during the emotional breakdown. The key points are the author's response to her emotions and the professional context.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. So, in terms of professional conduct, it's important to maintain boundaries. The author did distance themselves, which is appropriate because mixing personal feelings in the workplace can lead to issues. But the part where the author didn't console her and even increased the radio volume when she cried\u2014this seems harsh. While the author might not be wrong for not wanting to engage in a relationship, not responding empathetically when someone is clearly distressed could be seen as unkind.\n\nHowever, the author tried to keep things professional and didn't encourage the advances. The colleague later moved on, suggesting she wasn't permanently harmed. But the act of not providing any comfort, especially during a vulnerable moment, might be considered unkind, even if not unprofessional. The question is whether the author's lack of empathy makes them an asshole.\n\nIn some viewpoints, setting clear boundaries is right, but in others, showing some level of compassion is expected, even if you don't reciprocate feelings. The author's silence and ignoring her emotional state could be seen as wrong. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide any comfort, but there's also the argument about maintaining professionalism. However, the consensus might be that while the author handled the situation unprofessionally by rejecting the advances, the lack of consoling is where the problem lies. So, the answer could be A.\n"
