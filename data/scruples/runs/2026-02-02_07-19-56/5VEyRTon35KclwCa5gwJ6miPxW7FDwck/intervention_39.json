In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on him. The situation involves the author rejecting the girl's advances and then not offering any comfort when she became emotional.\n\nFirst, the author helped the new employee during onboarding, which is professional. However, when the girl expressed her feelings, the author rejected her, leading to her emotional outbursts. The key issue here is the author's response to her distress. \n\nIn the workplace, maintaining professionalism is important, but so is treating colleagues with basic humanity and respect. When someone is upset and in a vulnerable state, especially in a public setting, a complete lack of response might be seen as cold or inconsiderate. The author increased the radio volume and remained silent, which could be interpreted as dismissing her emotions rather than acknowledging her pain.\n\nEven though the author tried to keep things professional afterward and the girl eventually moved on, the way he handled the immediate emotional situation could be problematic. Consoling someone doesn't mean agreeing with them, but offering some empathy or at least not exacerbating the situation by ignoring their feelings entirely might have been more appropriate. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the girl's actions. Publicly professing a crush can be unprofessional, and the author might have been right to keep things strictly professional. But the way he responded to her crying and screaming, without any attempt to comfort her, even if just to say it's not personal, could be seen as harsh. \n\nBalancing these factors, the author's approach might not be the best, but it's a nuanced situation. The decision hinges on whether silence and ignoring her emotions in that moment were the wrong approach. In a public setting, maybe he had valid reasons for not engaging further, but the lack of any compassion could be seen as inconsiderate. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong, even if not severely. Answer A.\n"
