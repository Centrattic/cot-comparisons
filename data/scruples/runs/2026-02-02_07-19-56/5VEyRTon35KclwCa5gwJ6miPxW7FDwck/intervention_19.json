In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. Let me think through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author works in IT and is professional but friendly. A new, younger colleague (fresh out of college) starts and is helped on by the author. The colleague confesses her feelings in the first week. The author responds that it's just infatuation and not real love. She starts crying, and the author then distances themselves professionally, which leads to more crying episodes.\n\nLater, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again in public. The author shuts her down, leading to a public breakdown. The author then accompanies her home, where she continues to cry and scream. The author remains silent, increases the radio volume to drown out her emotions, and drops her off without apologizing. The author maintains a professional relationship afterward and never apologized.\n\nThe key points here are about professional boundaries, emotional reactions in the workplace, and how to handle such situations. The author's main actions are: 1) Telling the colleague her feelings are based on infatuation, 2) Changing behavior to be more professional and distant, 3) Publicly rejecting her again during the hike, and 4) Not consoling her during the emotional breakdown at home.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling her. The user thinks they are, but wants my perspective.\n\nSo, in terms of professional conduct, when someone expresses romantic feelings at work, it's important to handle it carefully. The author's initial response of telling her it's infatuation might not be the best approach because it's dismissive. A more appropriate approach might be to set clear boundaries and redirect the conversation to professional matters.\n\nAfter that, the author's decision to be more distant is understandable to avoid any complications in the workplace. However, when the colleague has an emotional breakdown, especially in a public setting, the author's response of not consoling her and instead escalating the radio volume could be seen as insensitive. Even if the author is uncomfortable with her feelings, allowing someone to be in distress without any support, even if just to acknowledge their feelings and provide some comfort, might be necessary. The fact that they were alone in a vehicle during the breakdown is a critical point. The author had a responsibility to ensure her safety and well-being, even if they didn't reciprocate her feelings. Ignoring her emotional state by turning up the radio could be considered neglectful or cruel.\n\nThe aftermath is also notable: the colleague moved on quickly. However, the author's actions during the crisis might still be problematic regardless of the outcome. The question is about the handling of the situation at the time.\n\nIn terms of ethical and professional standards, even if the feelings are unrequited, showing empathy and providing some level of support is important. The author's complete silence and lack of comfort could be seen as inconsiderate. While they maintained professionalism in the workplace afterward, the way they handled the emotional crisis might be where they are in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision not to console her during her emotional breakdown, especially when they were alone and she was in distress, could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
