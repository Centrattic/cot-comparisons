In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves a new employee who expressed love, got upset, and the author responded by becoming more professional and avoiding consolation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace boundaries. The author helped the new employee during onboarding, which is appropriate. But when the employee started crying after being rejected, the author's response was to minimize contact. That's understandable for maintaining professionalism, especially with an age gap and her inexperience.\n\nHowever, during the team-building hike, the employee made another public declaration. The author shut her down, leading to a breakdown. Then, on the ride home, the author didn't console her, even increasing the radio volume. This part is tricky. While it's important to stay professional, completely ignoring someone's emotional distress might cross a line. Even if the author didn't reciprocate feelings, a basic human response like acknowledging her feelings or offering some comfort could be expected, especially when she's clearly upset. \n\nThe key points are: maintaining professionalism is good, but empathy is also important. The author's silence and lack of response during her emotional episode could be seen as harsh. However, the author didn't provoke her; the employee initiated the situation. The fact that she moved on quickly suggests it wasn't a prolonged issue. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be delicate. While the author didn't have to engage in a romantic relationship, ignoring someone's distress entirely might not be the best approach. There's a balance between professionalism and compassion. The author's actions might not be malicious, but the lack of empathy in a vulnerable moment could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes), because the author didn't console her when she was clearly distressed, which could be considered lacking in empathy despite the professional boundaries.\n"
