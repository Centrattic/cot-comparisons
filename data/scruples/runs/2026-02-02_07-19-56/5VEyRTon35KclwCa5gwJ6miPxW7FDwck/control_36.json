In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an a**hole for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation is in the workplace, which is important because professional boundaries are key here.\n\nFirst, the guy helped onboarding a new, younger colleague. He was friendly, which is normal, but the girl took it as romantic. She told him she loves him in the first week. He responded that it's infatuation, not real love. She cried. Then he adjusted his behavior to be more professional, which led to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she publicly professes her love again. He shuts her down, leading to a breakdown. On the ride back, she's crying and screaming, and he doesn't console her, turns up the radio, and drops her off without apology. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. He tried to maintain professionalism after the initial confession. But when she publicly declares her feelings again, he shuts her down harshly. The ride back is where the issue is. She's clearly upset, and he doesn't offer any comfort. Instead, he uses silence and increases the radio volume. Even though he later keeps things professional, the act of not consoling her during her emotional breakdown might be seen as uncaring. However, he did volunteer to take her home, which could be seen as a responsible action. But his lack of empathy in that moment could be problematic. The key points are maintaining professionalism versus showing compassion. If he's not interested, he's not obligated to console her, but being completely silent and avoiding interaction might come off as cold. The fact that she moved on quickly isn't a factor in whether he's in the wrong. So, it's a balance between professionalism and human empathy. Depending on the perspective, he might be seen as not an a**hole because he's trying to stay professional, but others might say he should have at least shown some empathy. The answer isn't straightforward, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because maintaining boundaries is important, even if it comes off as harsh.\n"
