In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new female coworker who had a crush on him, and he didn't console her after she got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario step by step. The author helped onboarding the new girl, was friendly as usual. She told him she loved him early on. He responded that it was infatuation. She started crying. He then kept communication professional, which led to her more crying. Later, during a team-building hike, she tried to confess again publicly. He shut her down, leading to a breakdown. On the ride home, she was crying and screaming, and he didn't console her, even turned up the radio. He didn't apologize and kept it professional after. The P.S. says she moved on quickly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether he is an asshole for not consoling her.\n\nI need to consider workplace boundaries. He was professional, which is correct. But when she was emotional, he didn't console her. Is that wrong? The key points: he was clear from the start that he wasn't interested. She continued to pursue him, even in public. He didn't encourage her feelings. When she was upset, he tried to drop her off, but didn't console. Maybe he had a duty to be compassionate, even if he wasn't interested. However, he was in a professional setting, and she was being emotionally volatile. \n\nBut in a professional context, even if someone is emotional, you might be expected to handle it with some empathy. However, he was trying to avoid being rude. The question is whether not consoling her was wrong. Some might say he should have been more understanding. Others might say he was right to keep it professional and not engage in a relationship. \n\nThe fact that she then moved on quickly could indicate that she handled it eventually. But during the situation, he could have been more supportive. The ride home was a private moment where she was clearly hurting. By not consoling her, he might be seen as cruel, even if he wasn't responsible for her feelings. \n\nBut he wasn't the one who pursued her; she initiated both times. He was clear about his lack of interest. The problem is how he handled her emotional reactions. Turning up the radio and staying silent might be seen as dismissive. In a professional setting, even if you're not interested, you should treat people with basic respect and not be callous. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because even though he had the right to not be interested, his response could have been more compassionate. Not consoling her during a breakdown, especially when she was vulnerable, might be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's work. However, there's a counterargument that he was maintaining professionalism. But the line between professional and inconsiderate can be thin. If she was in distress, he might have a responsibility to at least acknowledge her feelings, even if he can't reciprocate. Therefore, AITA would lean towards A.\n"
