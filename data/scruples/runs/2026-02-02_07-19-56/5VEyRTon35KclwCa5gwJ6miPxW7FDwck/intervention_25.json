In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're an ass for not consoling a girl who had a crush on them. The situation is at work, and they were professional but friendly when the girl started. She told them she loved them right away, and they told her it was infatuation. She cried, and they backed off, making her cry more. Later, she confessed again during a team-building hike, and they shut her down, which led to a breakdown. The author just kept silent, turned up the radio, and dropped her off without saying anything. Now they're asking if they did the wrong thing.\n\nHmm. Well, in a workplace setting, it's important to maintain professionalism. The girl was new, maybe inexperienced, and there's an age gap. The author says they tried to be professional but maybe their response was too harsh. When she told them she loved them, the author dismissed it as infatuation, which could be harsh. Then, when she was clearly upset and crying, the author increased the volume of the radio instead of comforting her. Even if they didn't want to be in a relationship, being silent and ignoring her emotional state could be seen as uncaring.\n\nI think there's a line between being professional and being empathetic. Even if you don't reciprocate feelings, someone in distress deserves some level of compassion. The author didn't apologize later, which might make it worse. However, the girl moved on to someone else, so maybe the author's actions didn't have long-term consequences. But the act of not consoling her during her breakdown, especially when they were the one who caused it by rejecting her, could be seen as wrong. So I'm leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't show empathy during her emotional crisis, even if they were trying to stay professional.\n"
