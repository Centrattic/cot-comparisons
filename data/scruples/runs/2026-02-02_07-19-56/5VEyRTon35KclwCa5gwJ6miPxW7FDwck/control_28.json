In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not consoling the girl who had a crush on him. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author helped onboard a new coworker, who was fresh out of college and younger. He was friendly and professional, as he does with others. Then, the girl declared her love for him, which he dismissed as infatuation. She cried, and he adjusted his behavior to be more professional, leading to her crying again. Later, during a team-building event, she confessed again in public, leading to a public breakdown. He dropped her off, stayed silent, and didn't console her. Now, the question is whether he's wrong for not being supportive.\n\nThe key points here are professional boundaries, emotional manipulation, and the appropriateness of his response. The author maintained professionalism, which is important in workplaces. However, when she started crying publicly and needed emotional support, his silence and increasing the radio volume could be seen as harsh. Even if he didn't reciprocate her feelings, responding with empathy could have been better for her well-being. \n\nBut then, she got over it quickly and moved on. The author didn't engage in a relationship or encourage her feelings, so maybe he's not at fault. Still, in a situation where someone is emotionally distressed, especially a subordinate, providing some level of support might be expected, even if it's just to acknowledge her feelings. His actions might be seen as lacking empathy, which could make him an asshole, but if he kept things professional, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because he could have been more compassionate without compromising professionalism.\n"
