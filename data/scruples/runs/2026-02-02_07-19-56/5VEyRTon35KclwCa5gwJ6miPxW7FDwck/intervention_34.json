In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a workplace situation where the author didn't console a colleague who had a crush on them after rejecting her advances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author helped the new employee during onboarding and was friendly. The girl, who is much younger and just out of college, immediately professes her love. The author responds that it's infatuation and not real love. The girl starts crying, so the author distances themselves professionally. This leads to more crying episodes from her. Later, during a team-building event, the girl again declares her feelings publicly, which the author shuts down. The author then accompanies her home, where she's very emotional, and the author remains silent, even turning up the radio to drown out her crying. The author never apologizes and maintains a professional distance afterward. The girl eventually moves on to someone else.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Workplace Professionalism**: The author's initial response was to set boundaries, which is important in a professional setting. However, after the girl started showing emotional distress, the author's response was to completely cut her off and not offer any consolation during her emotional breakdown. \n\n2. **Emotional Response**: The girl's emotional reactions are significant. She's young, new to the workplace, and likely not used to such rejections. The author's silence and lack of empathy during her emotional crisis could be seen as harsh, especially in a public setting like a team-building event where others might be present. \n\n3. **Communication and Compassion**: While the author didn't act on the romantic interest, they could have been more empathetic in their rejection. Shutting down the girl's feelings and not providing any comfort might leave her feeling isolated or humiliated. The fact that the author increased the radio volume and said nothing could be interpreted as ignoring her emotional needs, which is unkind.\n\n4. **Aftermath**: The author maintained a professional distance, which is appropriate, but the lack of any attempt to console her might be considered inconsiderate. Even a brief acknowledgment of her feelings, while maintaining boundaries, could have been more compassionate.\n\n5. **Outcome**: The girl moved on to another colleague, but the author's actions might have contributed to a stressful work environment for her. The author's actions don't seem malicious, but they lack the necessary empathy in a situation where someone is clearly distressed.\n\nConsidering these points, while the author's initial response to set boundaries was correct, their subsequent actions (especially during the ride home) lacked compassion. Being a professional doesn't mean you have to be cold, especially when someone is emotionally vulnerable. The author could have been more empathetic while still maintaining professionalism. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not consoling her, even if their intent was to avoid a personal relationship.\n"
