In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation is in an IT company, and the person helped onboarding the new girl. She told him she loved him, he told her it was infatuation. She cried, so he became more professional. Then during a team-building hike, she professed her love again, he shut her down publicly, she had a breakdown. He took her home, she kept crying, he didn't console, just turned up the radio and stayed silent. He didn't apologize later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace boundaries. When someone starts a relationship, especially a new employee, there's a power dynamic. The author helped her onboard, so maybe he was in a position of influence. She's fresh out of college, so maybe more vulnerable. By not consoling her, he might have been avoiding any emotional involvement to keep things professional. But was his response appropriate?\n\nWhen she cried at work, he changed to being professional, which is good. But during the hike, she tried again, and he shut her down. Publicly rejecting someone can be harsh. Then taking her home, she's emotional, and he doesn't comfort her. Instead, turning up the radio and staying silent. That seems cold. Even if he didn't want to engage, a minimal level of empathy might be expected. Maybe he should have acknowledged her feelings in a calm way without getting into a discussion, but his silence and ignoring might be seen as unkind.\n\nAlso, she moved on quickly, so maybe there's no lasting harm. But the immediate response could be considered inconsiderate. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The key points are maintaining professionalism, handling emotional situations at work, and avoiding unnecessary harm. The author tried to stay professional but his response during the ride home could be seen as avoiding responsibility. So maybe the answer is A (wrong) because he didn't show any empathy during her emotional episode, even if he was trying to keep things professional. On the other hand, maybe B (not wrong) because he was maintaining boundaries. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think in these situations, even if you don't want to engage, showing some compassion is better. So leaning towards A.\n"
