In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (author) works in IT and helped a new colleague who had a crush on them. The new girl confessed her feelings twice, once in the office and then again during a team-building hike. The author rejected her, which led to the girl crying and getting upset. The author then tried to keep things professional but didn't console her during the emotional episodes, even increasing the radio volume when she started crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl is fresh out of college, so maybe she's young and not used to handling rejections. The age difference might also be a factor in how she processes the situation. The author's initial response was to say that her feelings were infatuation, which might be dismissive. Then, when she continued to show emotion, the author didn't console her but instead made it clear they wanted to keep things professional. \n\nNow, is it wrong to not console someone who's clearly upset? Well, even if you don't have feelings for them, showing empathy and compassion is usually expected, especially in a workplace setting where you need to maintain a respectful environment. The author's actions\u2014ignoring her emotional outbursts and increasing the radio volume\u2014could be seen as cruel or lacking in empathy. \n\nHowever, the author did try to handle the situation professionally after the second incident. They didn't engage further, and the girl eventually moved on. But the key issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. While it's okay to set boundaries, the way they handled the emotional aftermath might be harsh. Not consoling someone who's clearly distressed could be seen as unkind, especially if there's a power dynamic (like being more experienced or senior). \n\nIn a professional setting, maintaining boundaries is important, but empathy is also crucial. The author might have been trying to avoid making things awkward, but their approach could have contributed to a hostile work environment for the girl. The fact that the girl cried publicly and the author didn't respond with any emotional support could be considered inconsiderate. So, I think the author is in the wrong for not being more compassionate and for their handling of the situation during the car ride.\n"
