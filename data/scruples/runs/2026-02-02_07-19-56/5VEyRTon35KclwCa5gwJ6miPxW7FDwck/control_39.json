In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author works in IT and maintains professionalism. A new, younger colleague started, and they helped her onboarding. The author interacted kindly but professionally. The girl, still in her first week, tells the author she loves them. The author responds that it's infatuation, not real love. The girl then cries. The author then changes their behavior to be more professional, leading to more crying episodes.\n\nLater, during a team-building hike, the girl professes her feelings again in public. The author shuts her down publicly, causing her to have a breakdown. On the ride home, she cries and yells, but the author remains silent, turns up the radio, and doesn't console her. The author didn't apologize and kept things professional afterward. The girl eventually moves on to someone else.\n\nNow, the key question: Is the author in the wrong? Let's consider boundaries and professional conduct. The author was clear about their stance, and the girl misread the signals. The author tried to maintain a professional relationship after the initial rejection. However, when the girl escalated her behavior in public and during the ride, the author didn't respond empathetically. \n\nIn a professional setting, even if someone is being overwhelmed, there's an expectation to handle situations with some level of empathy, especially when someone is in distress. The author's silence and lack of response during the emotional breakdown might be seen as uncaring, even if they're trying to maintain boundaries. While the author isn't at fault for the girl's actions, their response could be considered harsh. They might have benefited from addressing the situation more constructively, perhaps by setting clearer boundaries without being dismissive. Therefore, the author's actions in not consoling her during her breakdown could be seen as inconsiderate, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
