In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not consoling a colleague who had a crush on them. The situation involves a new employee who expressed love, the author rejected her, and then didn't console her when she had emotional breakdowns.\n\nFirst, the author helped onboard the new employee, which is part of their job. The new employee, being fresh out of college, had a crush and declared it. The author was upfront, saying it was infatuation and that they didn't reciprocate. The employee then cried, and the author tried to keep things professional, which is reasonable in the workplace.\n\nBut then during a team-building hike, the employee professed her feelings again publicly. The author shut her down, leading to a breakdown. They took her home but stayed silent, even turning up the radio to avoid conversation. The key issue here is the author's response during her emotional crisis. \n\nIn a professional setting, especially when someone is emotionally distressed, there's a social expectation to show some level of empathy or at least not exacerbate the situation. The author chose to remain silent and even used the radio to block out the crying, which could be seen as callous. Even if they don't want to engage in a relationship, being unresponsive and dismissive during emotional episodes might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author did maintain professionalism afterward, and the employee eventually moved on. But the question is about whether the author was wrong in not consoling her. The answer depends on cultural expectations and personal ethics. In many workplaces, showing minimal empathy is expected to prevent emotional harm. The author's lack of response could be seen as an asshole move because they didn't provide comfort, even if they weren't interested in a relationship. So, the answer is A.\n"
