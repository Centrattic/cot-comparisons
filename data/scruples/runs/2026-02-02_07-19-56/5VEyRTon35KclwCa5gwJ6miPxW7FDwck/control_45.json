In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling the girl who had a crush on them. The situation is at work, and the girl started crying when he rejected her, and later she tried again in public during a team-building hike. The author didn't console her, kept silent, and even turned up the radio when she cried. \n\nFirst, I need to consider work ethics. The author tried to remain professional, which is good. But when someone is emotionally distressed, especially a colleague, there's an expectation to handle it with empathy. The girl was new, fresh out of college, and there's an age gap. That might mean she's more vulnerable or inexperienced in handling such rejections.\n\nThe author shut her down both times, which could be seen as harsh. Even if they don't want to engage romantically, responding with silence and ignoring her emotional state might be unkind. The fact that she was crying and screaming, and he didn't console her but instead increased the radio volume suggests a lack of compassion. \n\nIn a professional setting, it's important to maintain boundaries, but also to show basic human kindness. Maybe the author should have set a firm but empathetic boundary instead of completely shutting her down. If the girl was acting unprofessionally, like crying in public, the author might have a case in terms of keeping things professional, but the way he handled it by not offering any comfort could be seen as cruel.\n\nThe P.S. says she moved on after a few weeks, but that doesn't excuse the lack of empathy. The key issue here is whether it's acceptable to ignore someone's emotional distress, even if it's inappropriate behavior. The author's actions might have contributed to a hostile work environment, which isn't good. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not showing any empathy or support, even if he didn't want to engage in a relationship. The correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
