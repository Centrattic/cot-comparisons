In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a workplace interaction where the author helped a new colleague who had a crush on them. The key points here are the power dynamics, the author's response, and the potential for emotional harm.\n\nFirst, the new employee is fresh out of college, which means she might be less experienced in handling workplace relationships. The age difference could also contribute to a power imbalance, as the author might have more experience or seniority. When she expressed her feelings, the author dismissed it as infatuation, which might have been harsh. Then, the author changed their behavior to be more professional but kept it to a minimum, leading to crying episodes. \n\nIn the team-building hike, the author publicly rejected her again, leading to a breakdown. The author didn't console her, increased the radio volume to drown out her crying, and dropped her off without further interaction. The question is whether this response was appropriate.\n\nWorkplace romances can be tricky, but when one person has a crush and the other isn't interested, it's important to handle it with care. The author's approach seems to be avoiding the issue rather than addressing it compassionately. By not providing any comfort or clear communication, the author might have exacerbated the situation. Even if there's no romantic interest, maintaining professionalism and empathy is crucial, especially when someone is visibly upset.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author didn't apologize or take any steps to ensure her well-being after the incident could be seen as neglecting their responsibility. While the author tried to keep things professional, their method of ignoring the emotional distress might not be the right approach. In a workplace setting, it's important to foster a respectful environment, and ignoring someone's emotional state could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author had a right to not pursue a relationship and to set boundaries. But the way they handled it\u2014by being completely silent, increasing the radio volume, and not offering any support\u2014could be seen as cruel or indifferent. The author's actions didn't help the situation and might have contributed to the colleague's emotional turmoil. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's response was likely inconsiderate and lacked empathy, which could make them at fault. So the answer would be A.\n"
