During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is working in an IT company and helped a new girl who was just out of college. They were friendly during onboarding, but the girl told them she loves them. The author told her it's just infatuation, which made her cry. Then the author kept communication minimal and professional, leading to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she professed her love again publicly, which the author shut down. The author then took her home, and during the ride, the girl kept crying and screaming, but the author increased the radio volume and stayed silent. The author didn't apologize and kept things professional. The girl moved on to someone else in a few weeks.\n\nThe question is whether the author was an asshole for not consoling her. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girl had a crush on the author, which she expressed directly. The author's response was to tell her it's infatuation, then minimize contact. When the girl tried again publicly, the author shut her down. In the ride home, the author didn't console her and instead turned up the radio. The author didn't apologize, but the girl eventually moved on.\n\nNow, thinking about professional boundaries. In a workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism, especially when there's a significant age difference (since the girl is fresh out of college and the author is older). The author tried to be friendly initially but then stepped back to professional behavior. That part seems reasonable to avoid any workplace issues. \n\nHowever, when the girl is emotionally distressed, the author's response is to shut her down and not console her. Even though there's no romantic interest, someone who's upset and crying might need some level of empathy. The author's actions during the ride home are questionable\u2014increasing the radio volume when she's crying could be seen as dismissive or even cruel. \n\nBut the author might argue that they were trying to maintain professionalism and that they can't be responsible for the girl's emotional state. The girl later moved on, so maybe the author's approach worked in the long run. However, the method of handling the situation could be seen as lacking in compassion. \n\nI need to consider whether the author's actions crossed the line from professional to unkind. While maintaining professionalism is important, completely ignoring someone's emotional distress might be considered inconsiderate. The author didn't have to engage romantically, but providing some basic comfort or at least not escalating the situation with harsh actions could be expected. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's actions were unprofessional (professing love publicly at a team-building event), and the author might have felt it necessary to enforce boundaries. Still, the way the author handled the aftermath\u2014especially during the ride home\u2014could be seen as contributing to the girl's distress. \n\nSo, the key factors are: maintaining professional boundaries vs. showing empathy. The author did the former but possibly failed in the latter. Therefore, there's a case to be made that the author was in the wrong because they could have been more compassionate without compromising professionalism. The answer might be A. However, others might argue that the author was justified in keeping distance and not consoling her, hence answer B. \n\nI think the line is thin here. The author's actions during the ride home, specifically increasing the radio volume and staying silent, could be seen as dismissive and harsh. Even if the author wasn't in a position to console her romantically, showing some basic human empathy would be expected. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
