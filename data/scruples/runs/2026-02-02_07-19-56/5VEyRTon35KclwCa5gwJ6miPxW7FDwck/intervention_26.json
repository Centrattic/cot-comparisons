In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves workplace dynamics, age difference, and emotional reactions.\n\nFirst, the author helped onboard a new, younger coworker and was friendly. The coworker declared love early on, and the author dismissed it as infatuation. The coworker cried, and the author distanced themselves. Later, in a public team event, the coworker confessed again, leading to an emotional breakdown. The author didn't comfort her, increased the radio volume when she cried, and left. They claim she moved on quickly.\n\nI need to consider workplace behavior norms. It's generally inappropriate to engage in romantic relationships at work, so the author's initial refusal makes sense. However, when the coworker is clearly upset, especially in a public setting, the author's response seems harsh. Silently ignoring her emotional distress without any attempt to console or address her feelings could be seen as cruel, even if they don't want to pursue a relationship. Professionalism requires empathy, especially when someone is in distress. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they lack compassion. The fact that the coworker was new and younger adds context; maybe the author should have been more considerate given her inexperience. The author's silence and ignoring her emotions in the car could contribute to a hostile work environment, even if they tried to keep things professional afterward. So, while the initial rejection is okay, the lack of empathy in handling her emotional state might make the author at fault.\n"
