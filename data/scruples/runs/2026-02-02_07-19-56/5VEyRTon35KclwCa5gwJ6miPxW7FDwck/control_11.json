In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them.\n\nFirst, the context: The person works in an IT company and maintains a professional demeanor. They helped a new, younger, college graduate coworker during onboarding. The coworker expressed her feelings early on, which the person dismissed as infatuation. The coworker then had emotional reactions, including crying at work. The person adjusted their behavior to be more professional, which led to more crying episodes. Later, in a team-building hike, the coworker tried to profess her feelings again, leading to a public breakdown. The person didn't console her, increased the radio volume during the ride, and stayed silent. The coworker eventually moved on.\n\nKey points to consider: \n\n1. **Professional Boundaries**: The person maintained professional interactions, which is generally expected in a workplace, especially with a significant age difference and the coworker being new. However, the way they handled the emotional situation might be questioned. \n\n2. **Communication and Empathy**: While it's the person's right to reject advances, the lack of any consoling or empathy during the crying episodes could be seen as harsh. Even if they didn't want to engage in a relationship, a polite and compassionate response might have been more appropriate to avoid embarrassing or distressing the coworker publicly.\n\n3. **Workplace Environment**: Emotional outbursts at work can be disruptive. However, the person's response (increasing the radio volume, staying silent) might be perceived as dismissive rather than supportive. Even if the person felt uncomfortable, some level of acknowledgment or redirection could help maintain a respectful environment.\n\n4. **Consequences**: The coworker eventually moved on, suggesting that the person's actions didn't have long-term negative effects. However, the immediate reactions (crying, screaming) indicate that the handling of the situation was harmful.\n\n5. **Intent and Responsibility**: The person didn't initiate the advances but is being asked if they're in the wrong for not providing comfort. While they have the right to set boundaries, not offering any form of empathy could be seen as neglecting their responsibility to handle the situation with care, even if they don't reciprocate feelings.\n\nIn summary, while maintaining professional boundaries is important, the lack of any empathetic response in the face of the coworker's emotional distress could be viewed as inconsiderate. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong for not consoling her, even if they were within their rights to reject her advances. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they failed to show empathy and support when it was needed, which can contribute to a hostile work environment.\n"
