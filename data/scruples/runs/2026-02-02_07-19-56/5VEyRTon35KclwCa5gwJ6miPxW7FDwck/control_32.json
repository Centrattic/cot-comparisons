In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The scenario involves the girl declaring her feelings, crying, and the author responding by keeping things professional and not offering comfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author helped onboard a new, younger colleague. The girl's actions\u2014professing love twice, crying in the workplace, and during a team-building hike\u2014suggest she might be emotionally vulnerable. The author's response was to distance professionally and not console her, which led to more crying episodes.\n\nIn a workplace, maintaining professionalism is crucial. However, even in professional settings, there's an expectation of basic kindness and empathy, especially towards someone who's clearly upset. The author didn't engage in the emotional aspect, but they also didn't act unprofessionally. They tried to keep interactions minimal and professional. \n\nThe key points here are: the girl's age difference and being fresh out of college might make her less experienced in handling rejections. The author's silence and increasing the radio volume during her breakdown could be seen as dismissive, but it's also possible they were trying to avoid further emotional escalation. However, completely ignoring someone's emotional distress, even if they're a colleague, can be seen as lacking empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't encourage the relationship, called out the infatuation, and maintained boundaries. They didn't engage in a romantic relationship, which is appropriate. The question is whether not offering any consolation is being an asshole. \n\nIn many professional environments, especially in cultures that value workplace decorum, there's a balance between professionalism and human decency. The author might have handled it more compassionately, maybe by gently redirecting the conversation or suggesting she talk to someone else. But by not engaging at all, they might have contributed to her distress. \n\nThe fact that she moved on quickly could indicate that she wasn't in a serious emotional crisis, but that's not the author's responsibility. The issue is about their response. The author's actions weren't malicious, but they could have shown more empathy. Whether that makes them an asshole is debatable. Some might say B (not in the wrong) because they kept things professional, while others might say A (in the wrong) for not offering any support.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards B, but there's a middle ground where the author could have improved their approach. However, since the question is a binary choice, and the author didn't act unprofessionally, the answer is likely B.\n"
