In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author helped onboarding a new colleague, being friendly as usual. The new girl, straight out of college and younger, tells him she loves him. He responds that it's just infatuation, which causes her to cry. Then he distances himself professionally, leading to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again in public. The author shuts her down, leading to a breakdown where she's unable to continue. He takes her home, but instead of consoling her, he stays silent and increases the radio volume when she cries. He doesn't apologize and maintains professionalism afterward. The question is whether he was an asshole for not consoling her.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about workplace boundaries, emotional responses, and how to handle such situations. Let's think about the dynamics. The author was clear from the start that he wasn't interested, which is important. However, when the girl reacts emotionally, especially in a public setting where she's distressed, the author's response is to remain silent and avoid interaction. \n\nIn workplace scenarios, it's generally advised to maintain professionalism, but there's also a responsibility to treat colleagues with respect and empathy. Even if someone is being unprofessional or overstepping, the appropriate response might involve setting boundaries while still showing compassion. \n\nThe girl is in a vulnerable state during the hike, crying and screaming. The author's silence and turning up the radio could be seen as dismissive or uncaring. While he's not obligated to comfort her, intentionally ignoring her emotional state might cross into being unkind. Also, considering her age and inexperience, he might have a duty to handle the situation with more delicacy. \n\nHowever, he did take her home, which shows some concern for her well-being. But his actions during the ride\u2014silence and high volume\u2014could be interpreted as avoiding responsibility or not acknowledging her feelings. The fact that she later moved on might mitigate some of the perceived harm, but the immediate reaction is still a point of concern.\n\nIn terms of workplace ethics, if someone is acting unreasonably, you set boundaries, but you shouldn't intentionally harm or belittle them. The author's approach here might have been too harsh, especially when she's clearly upset. There's a balance between professionalism and compassion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions during the ride home might be seen as lacking empathy. Even if he doesn't want to engage, a more respectful approach would be to acknowledge her feelings or at least not make her feel ignored. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances.\n\nWait, the author did try to keep communication professional after the initial rejection. But when she's in a breakdown, silence isn't the best response. Maybe he should have said something to comfort her without engaging with her romantic advances. But he didn't, and that could be seen as inconsiderate. So yes, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
