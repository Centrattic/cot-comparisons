In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that a new female coworker had a crush on him, declared her love twice, and he didn't console her when she was upset, even increasing the radio volume during her emotional outbursts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace professionalism. The author helped her onboard and was friendly, which is normal. But when she expressed her feelings, he responded by saying it's infatuation and then became more distant. That's understandable to avoid a romantic relationship at work. However, when she cried, he didn't console her. In the team-building hike incident, he shut her down publicly, then during the ride home, he stayed silent and increased the radio, not offering any comfort. That seems harsh. \n\nIs it his responsibility to console her? Maybe not, but in a professional setting, maintaining empathy is usually expected. Even if he doesn't want a relationship, being completely silent and ignoring her emotional state could be seen as cold. However, he also didn't engage with her inappropriate advances, which is important. The fact that she moved on quickly might suggest she wasn't seriously harmed, but that's not the main point. The main issue is whether his response was appropriate. \n\nHe kept things professional after, which is good, but the lack of empathy during her emotional episodes might make him the asshole. So, maybe A (yes, he's wrong) because he could have been more compassionate while still being professional. But also, B (no) because he had the right to avoid a romantic relationship. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given the public rejection and not offering any support, even if she was being inappropriate, he could have handled it better. So probably A.\n"
