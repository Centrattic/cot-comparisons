In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. Let's start by looking at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author helped a new employee onboard, being friendly as usual. The new girl, who's fresh out of college and there's a significant age gap, tells the author she loves him. He tells her it's infatuation and she doesn't really know him. She starts crying. He then distances himself professionally, leading to more crying episodes.\n\nLater, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again in public. The author shuts her down, causing her to have a breakdown. He accompanies her home, where she continues to cry and scream. Instead of consoling her, he increases the radio volume and stays silent. Eventually, she moves on to someone else in a few weeks.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether not consoling someone during an emotional breakdown is wrong. The author's actions seem harsh. Emotional support is important, even if someone is rejecting affection. By not providing any comfort and instead increasing the radio, he's avoiding empathy. In a professional setting, even if there's a crush, treating someone with respect and compassion is expected. The fact that she was a new employee and significantly younger adds to the responsibility of the author to handle the situation with care.\n\nHowever, the author did maintain professional boundaries after the initial interactions. But the act of not consoling during her breakdown, especially when she's clearly distressed, could be seen as neglecting a basic human need. The age and experience difference might mean the author should have been more considerate, considering her inexperience in the workplace and emotional maturity.\n\nOn the other hand, he tried to keep it professional. But the way he handled the breakdown (ignoring her emotional state) is problematic. Even if he's not responsible for her feelings, his response could have been more compassionate. The silence and lack of support might have exacerbated her distress, even if she moved on quickly.\n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong. The key points are the lack of empathy during her breakdown and the public rejection. While maintaining professionalism is important, it shouldn't come at the cost of completely ignoring someone's emotional needs, especially in a vulnerable moment.\n"
