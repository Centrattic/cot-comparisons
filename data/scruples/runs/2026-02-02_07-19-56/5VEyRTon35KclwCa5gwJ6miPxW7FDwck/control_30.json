In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The writer helped the new girl get onboarded, and she told them she loved them. They responded that it's infatuation and not real love. She started crying, and the writer then became more professional, which led to more crying episodes.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, she professed her love again in public. The writer shut her down, leading her to have a fit. They took her home, and during the ride, she cried and screamed while the writer stayed silent and turned up the radio. The writer didn't console her and maintained professionalism afterward. The P.S. mentions she moved on quickly.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is an asshole for not consoling her. Answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The writer made an effort to be professional and friendly initially. The coworker had a crush and expressed it twice, leading to emotional reactions. The writer distanced themselves professionally to avoid further issues. During the hike incident, they didn't comfort her but instead stayed silent and increased the radio. The aftermath was that the coworker got over it.\n\nNow, considering workplace ethics and emotional support. When someone is emotionally vulnerable, especially in a professional setting, there's an expectation to handle situations with empathy. Even if the feelings are unrequited, the person showing interest might be in distress. The writer's response of increasing radio volume and not saying anything could be seen as neglecting to provide basic empathy, which might be unkind.\n\nHowever, the writer did take her home, which shows some level of responsibility. They tried to keep the relationship professional, which is important in the workplace. But the lack of any attempt to console her during the emotional breakdown could be a problem. The writer's silence and use of the radio as a barrier might have exacerbated her feelings of rejection.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is whether the writer had a duty to console her. Since the coworker was in emotional distress, even if unrequited, the writer could have shown more compassion. The actions taken (increasing radio volume) might be seen as dismissive rather than professional. While maintaining boundaries is important, doing so without empathy can be harmful.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer might lean towards A, the writer is in the wrong for not providing some level of comfort, even if they didn't reciprocate feelings. However, workplace boundaries are also important. But the way they handled the situation, especially during the drive, could be seen as lacking in empathy. Hence, the answer is A.\n"
