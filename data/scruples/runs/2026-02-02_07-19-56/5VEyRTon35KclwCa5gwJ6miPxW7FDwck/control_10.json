In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for not consoling a colleague who had a crush on them. The situation is in a professional setting, so I need to consider workplace dynamics and appropriate behavior.\n\nFirst, the girl confessed her feelings in a professional context. The author responded by saying it's infatuation, which is a common way to handle such situations to maintain professionalism. The girl cried, which is an emotional reaction, but the author adjusted their behavior to be more professional. \n\nThen, during a team-building hike, she professed her feelings again in public. The author shut her down, leading to an emotional outburst. They took her home but stayed silent, even increasing the radio volume to drown out her crying. The author didn't apologize and kept things professional.\n\nThe key points here are maintaining professionalism and respecting boundaries. The author didn't engage in the emotional outburst and instead focused on keeping the workplace environment professional. However, some might argue that even in a professional setting, showing empathy is important, especially when someone is clearly upset. \n\nBut the author did take her home and didn't escalate the situation. The fact that she moved on quickly suggests that the author's actions, while not kind, didn't have lasting harm. In a workplace context, it's often advised to avoid romantic relationships and to handle such situations by being polite but firm. \n\nThe author did not act aggressively or unprofessionally. They handled the situation by minimizing interaction afterward and not engaging further. While there's an argument for showing more compassion, the author's actions were within the bounds of professional behavior. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong), as maintaining professionalism is crucial in the workplace, even if the emotional response could have been more empathetic.\n"
