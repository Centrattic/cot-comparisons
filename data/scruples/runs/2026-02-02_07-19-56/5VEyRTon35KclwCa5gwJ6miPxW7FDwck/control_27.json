In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves a new employee who started crying after being rejected twice\u2014once in the office and again during a team-building hike. The author stayed silent and even turned up the radio during the ride home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace professionalism. The author helped the new employee initially, which is part of their job. However, when the employee expressed feelings, the author dismissed it as infatuation. That might be a bit harsh, but it's their right to set boundaries. \n\nBut the key issue here is the lack of empathy. The author didn't console her during the emotional breakdowns. Even if they didn't want to engage in a relationship, responding with some level of compassion is important. Publicly rejecting someone can be hurtful, but doing so without any attempt to console them, especially during a vulnerable moment, might cross a line. \n\nAlso, during the ride back, increasing the radio volume instead of acknowledging her emotions shows a lack of empathy. While it's important to maintain professionalism, completely ignoring someone's emotional state could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author might have thought they were being professional by not engaging, but in reality, a more empathetic approach could have been both professional and kind. The fact that the other person moved on quickly doesn't excuse the author's behavior. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps intended to keep things professional, lacked the necessary compassion and support, making them at least partly at fault.\n"
