In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who helped onboarding a new female coworker who had a crush on him. She told him she loves him, and he dismissed it as infatuation. She started crying, so he became more professional and minimized interaction, which led to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she tried to confess again publicly, and he shut her down, leading to another emotional outburst. He drove her home but didn't console her, kept silent, and turned up the radio. Now, the question is whether he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman is fresh out of college, there's an age gap, and the guy acted professionally. He didn't reciprocate her feelings and tried to keep things professional. However, his response to her emotional outbursts was to remain silent and not console her. \n\nOn one hand, in a workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism, especially when there's a power dynamic or age difference. The author didn't encourage her feelings beyond what's appropriate. On the other hand, during the ride home, her emotional state was deteriorating, and he didn't offer any comfort. Even though he didn't reciprocate her feelings, being silent and avoiding the situation might be seen as uncaring. \n\nThe key here is the emotional response. While he's not obligated to have a relationship, his lack of empathy during her breakdown could be seen as harsh. However, he did take her home and avoided public confrontation. The fact that she moved on quickly might also be a factor, but that doesn't excuse his behavior towards her during the incident. \n\nProfessionalism is important, but it's also about treating people with respect and dignity. If he could have been more empathetic without engaging in a relationship, that might have been better. But given the circumstances, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the act of not consoling someone in distress, even if you don't have feelings for them, could be seen as lacking in compassion. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the line between being professional and being a jerk is thin. If he had acknowledged her feelings without reciprocating, it might have been better. His silence and increasing the radio were unhelpful. So maybe he is in the wrong for not showing empathy, even if he's not responsible for her feelings. \n\nBut then again, he's not her romantic partner. Maybe he's not obligated to console her. However, in a professional setting, even if she's an adult, responding to someone's emotional distress with silence isn't ideal. There's a balance between professionalism and humanity. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his silence was necessary. Since she was clearly upset and he had a role in causing that distress by his rejection, he might have a responsibility to at least be polite and offer some comfort without engaging in a relationship. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not consoling her when she was clearly in emotional pain.\n"
