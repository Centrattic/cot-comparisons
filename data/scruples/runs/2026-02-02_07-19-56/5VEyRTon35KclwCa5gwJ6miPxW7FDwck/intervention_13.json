In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person works in IT and tried to stay professional. A new girl started, and they helped her onboard. The girl had a crush and told them she loves them. The author said it's just infatuation and that she doesn't really love them. The girl started crying. Then the author changed their behavior to be more professional, which led to more crying episodes from the girl. Later, during a team-building hike, the girl professed her love again, and the author shut her down, leading to a public breakdown. The author then took her home, drove her, and during the ride, the girl was crying and screaming, and the author just kept silent and turned up the radio. They didn't apologize and kept things professional after that. The girl moved on to another guy after a few weeks.\n\nThe question is whether the author was an asshole for not consoling her. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, let's consider the situation. The girl is new, fresh out of college, and there's an age gap. She's probably young and inexperienced. The author helped her onboard, so she might have seen them as supportive. Declaring love suddenly can be overwhelming for either party.\n\nWhen the girl first told the author she loved them, the author dismissed it as infatuation. That's a common response when someone is not interested. But then the girl cried. Maybe the author could have handled it more compassionately. Instead of just changing behavior to be minimal, perhaps they could have addressed her feelings in a way that's professional but not hurtful.\n\nThen, during the hike, the girl tried again, and the author shut her down. The public breakdown is a problem. Then taking her home, she continued to cry and scream, and the author didn't console her, just turned up the radio. That seems really harsh. Even if the author isn't interested, there's a responsibility to treat someone with basic humanity, especially in a vulnerable moment.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky, but when someone is clearly upset and in emotional distress, the appropriate response would usually involve some level of empathy and support, even if you're not interested romantically. The author's silence and lack of action during her breakdown might be seen as cold and neglectful.\n\nThe fact that the girl moved on quickly might not absolve the author of responsibility. The way they handled the situation could have been hurtful and unprofessional. The author might have been in the right to not reciprocate feelings, but the method of handling it could be problematic. Not consoling someone who's emotionally distressed isn't just about being wrong, but about how it affects the person and the workplace environment.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions seem harsh. They didn't provide any comfort, which is what a compassionate person might do, even if they are not interested. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
