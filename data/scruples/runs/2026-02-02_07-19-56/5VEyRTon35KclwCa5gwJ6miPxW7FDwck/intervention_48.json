In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. \n\nFirst, the context: The author works in IT, maintains a professional demeanor, and helped a new colleague. The girl, fresh out of college with an age gap, confessed her love. The author dismissed it as infatuation and distanced themselves, leading to her emotional breakdowns. On a team-building hike, she declared her love again, and the author shut her down, leading to a public fit. The author didn't console her, increased the radio to drown out her crying, and left without apology.\n\nSo, the key points here are about professional boundaries and emotional response. The author tried to stay professional but their actions might have crossed into unkind territory. When someone is emotionally upset, especially in a vulnerable position, it's generally expected to show some empathy. The author didn't just not console her; they actively avoided the situation by turning up the radio and staying silent. That seems harsh, even if they wanted to maintain professionalism. \n\nHowever, the girl did profess her feelings in a public setting again, which the author had to address. But the way they handled it\u2014without any attempt to console or de-escalate\u2014might be seen as cruel. Professionalism doesn't always mean being cold. The author could have been firm but kind, perhaps explaining that they can't engage in a relationship and suggesting she focus on work or seek support elsewhere. \n\nThe fact that she moved on to someone else might imply that the author's actions didn't have long-term consequences, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility in the moment. The core issue is whether the author had a duty to respond with some level of empathy, even if they weren't interested. \n\nIn many workplace scenarios, especially with colleagues who are new and perhaps more emotionally vulnerable (being fresh out of college), it's important to maintain a supportive environment. The author's silence and dismissal could have contributed to a hostile work environment for that individual. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because their response was unnecessarily harsh and lacked the basic human empathy expected in such situations, even if they were trying to stay professional.\n"
