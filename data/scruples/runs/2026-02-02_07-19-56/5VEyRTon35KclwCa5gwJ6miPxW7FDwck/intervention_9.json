In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a guy at work who helped a new female colleague, and she developed a crush. He rejected her, and she cried. He then distanced himself professionally. Later, during a team hike, she professes love again, and he shuts her down harshly, not consoling her. The key question is whether he's an asshole for not consoling her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the professional context. In a workplace, maintaining boundaries is important. The guy did help her onboarding and was friendly initially, but when she expressed feelings, he was clear it was infatuation. Then, when she became emotional, he distanced himself. But during the hike, he didn't respond with empathy when she was upset, even increasing the radio volume to ignore her. \n\nThe user thinks he's in the wrong. The question is whether he should have consoled her. Even if he doesn't want a relationship, being unresponsive or dismissive in someone's emotional moment can be hurtful. However, he did drop her home and didn't escalate the situation. Maybe he was trying to stay professional. But not consoling her during her emotional breakdown might be seen as uncaring. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. While it's okay to set boundaries, ignoring someone's emotional needs entirely might be seen as harsh. The fact that she moved on quickly might not matter; the immediate reaction is about how he handled her distress. Some might argue he had a right to distance himself, but his method could be seen as unkind. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether ignoring her emotional outburst was necessary. If he could have been kind but firm, that would be better. But since he chose silence and increased the radio, that's probably inconsiderate. Hence, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there are mitigating factors like intent to stay professional.\n"
