In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author rejecting a girl's romantic advances at work and not consoling her when she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girl started a job, the author helped her onboarding, and she developed a crush. The author told her it was infatuation, leading her to cry. Then, during a team-building hike, she confessed again, and the author didn't console her, even turning up the radio to avoid interaction. The author defends their actions by saying they kept it professional afterward and the girl moved on quickly.\n\nThe key points to consider here are workplace professionalism, emotional response, and appropriate handling of a colleague's emotional distress. The author's behavior seems to lack empathy. When someone is emotionally vulnerable, especially a new employee, a professional approach would involve being kind and offering support, even if they're making a mistake. Shutting them down publicly without a word and then ignoring their emotional state in the car could be seen as harsh and unprofessional.\n\nAlso, the age difference and the girl being fresh out of college might mean she's less experienced in handling workplace dynamics and rejections. The author, having more experience, has a responsibility to act with maturity. The author's silence and indifference during her crying episodes could contribute to a hostile work environment, even if they didn't have romantic feelings.\n\nHowever, the author did try to keep things professional after the initial interactions. But the main issue is the lack of empathy and support when the girl was clearly upset. In a workplace setting, it's important to maintain a respectful and supportive environment. Not consoling someone in distress, especially when they're vulnerable, can be seen as the wrong approach, even if the rejection itself is justified.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, lacked the necessary empathy and professionalism in handling a colleague's emotional state. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
