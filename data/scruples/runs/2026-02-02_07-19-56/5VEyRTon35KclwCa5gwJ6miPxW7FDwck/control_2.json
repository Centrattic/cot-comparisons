In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a workplace crush and how the author handled the girl's emotional reactions.\n\nFirst, the author helped the new employee during onboarding, which is normal. The girl had a crush and expressed it early on. The author was clear that it's infatuation, not love. The girl cried, so the author reduced interaction to keep it professional. Then, during a team hike, she confesses again publicly, leading to another emotional breakdown. The author doesn't console her, increases the radio during the ride, and drops her off. Later, the girl moves on to someone else.\n\nNow, considering workplace ethics, maintaining professionalism is key. The author tried to keep things professional after the initial rejection. However, when the girl is emotionally distressed, especially during a ride home, the author's response is to ignore her and increase the radio volume. This could be seen as lacking empathy. While the author isn't obligated to engage in a relationship, responding to someone in emotional distress with silence and avoiding comfort might be considered uncaring. The fact that the girl later moves on doesn't negate the immediate impact of the author's actions. The author's behavior during the ride home is the main issue here. Not consoling someone who's clearly upset could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they eventually get over it. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't show empathy during a vulnerable moment, even if maintaining professionalism is important.\n"
