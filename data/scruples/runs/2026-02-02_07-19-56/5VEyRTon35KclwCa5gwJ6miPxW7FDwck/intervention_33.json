In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author (AITA) was in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author helped onboard a new employee who was young and fresh out of college. The girl immediately confessed her love, which the author dismissed as infatuation. She cried, and the author became more distant. Later, during a team-building event, she declared her love again, leading to a public breakdown. The author took her home but didn't console her, even increasing the radio volume to avoid interaction.\n\nThe key points here are workplace boundaries and empathy. The author tried to maintain professionalism, which is good, but the response to the girl's emotional distress might be questionable. When someone is clearly upset, especially in a vulnerable situation like a new employee, not offering any comfort could be seen as harsh. Even if the author didn't want to engage, some level of empathy or at least a polite acknowledgment might be expected. The fact that the author didn't apologize and kept it professional afterward is important, but during the emotional moment, their silence and increasing the radio volume could come off as dismissive or cruel. \n\nHowever, the author did take her home, which is a responsible action. The girl moved on quickly, so maybe the author's approach worked in the long run. But the immediate reaction\u2014ignoring her emotional outburst\u2014might be seen as lacking compassion, even if the author wasn't at fault for the initial rejection. \n\nIn a workplace setting, especially with a new employee, maintaining boundaries is crucial, but there's also a responsibility to handle sensitive situations with care. The author's actions during the ride home seem to lack that care. So, while the author might not be entirely wrong, there's a case to be made that they could have handled it more empathetically. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the lack of consoling despite the girl's distress.\n"
