In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether not consoling someone who had a crush on them makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author works in IT, helped a new colleague (who was fresh out of college and younger) during onboarding. The girl told the author she loved him early on. The author responded that it was infatuation and she didn't really know him. The girl cried, and the author started being more professional and distant, which led to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, the girl confessed her feelings again publicly. The author shut her down, leading her to a breakdown. The author then took her home, didn't console her, and just dropped her off. The girl eventually moved on to someone else.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The girl is new, possibly inexperienced in the workplace and in relationships. She had a crush and expressed it, which is common but can be awkward in a professional setting. The author's initial response was to dismiss her feelings as infatuation, which might have been harsh. Then, after her public confession, the author didn't console her, kept silent, and increased the radio volume to avoid her emotional outburst. The author maintained professionalism afterward but didn't apologize.\n\nIs there a responsibility here to console someone who's clearly upset? In a workplace, maintaining professionalism is important, but emotional support can also be necessary, especially if someone is in distress. The author's approach was to avoid any engagement, which might have been seen as uncaring. Even if the feelings are unreciprocated, someone in distress may need empathy. The author's silence and lack of response could be interpreted as neglecting her emotional state, even if there's no romantic interest.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were trying to keep things professional and didn't want to engage in a personal relationship. The girl's reaction was extreme, and the author didn't want to encourage her further. But in such situations, a balance is needed between professionalism and compassion. Simply ignoring her emotional state might not be the best approach, even if the author didn't want to enter a relationship.\n\nAlso, the girl eventually moved on, suggesting that she wasn't permanently harmed, but that doesn't negate the immediate emotional impact. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to her distress without offering support. In a professional setting, especially when a junior colleague is involved, it's important to consider their well-being, even if it's not a personal responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not providing some level of empathy or at least not escalating the situation further. While maintaining professionalism is key, being completely silent and avoiding any form of consolation can come off as cold or dismissive. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
