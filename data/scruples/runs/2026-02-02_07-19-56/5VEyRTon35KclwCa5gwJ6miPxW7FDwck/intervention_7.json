In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation is that the new girl started crying after being rejected, and the author didn't console her, even increasing the radio volume during her emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author helped onboarding her, which might have led to her developing a crush. When she told them she loved them, the author dismissed it as infatuation, which could be harsh. Then, the girl started crying at work. The author changed their behavior to be professional but it led to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building trip, she professed her love again publicly. The author shut her down, leading to her emotional breakdown on the ride home. The author didn't console her, just stayed silent and increased the radio volume. The question is if that's wrong.\n\nI think the key points are about emotional support and professional boundaries. The author might have felt they were maintaining professionalism by not engaging, but the way they handled her distress could be seen as neglecting her emotional state. Even in a professional setting, basic human empathy is expected. Letting someone cry and scream without any attempt to calm them, especially when they're clearly upset, could be considered uncaring. The author's silence and increasing the radio volume might be seen as intentionally ignoring her pain, which is unkind. However, the author might argue they were trying to avoid encouraging her further or maintaining professionalism. But there's a line between professionalism and cruelty. Consoling someone in distress isn't unprofessional; it's a basic human response. The author's actions could have exacerbated the situation. The fact that the girl moved on quickly doesn't absolve the author of their responsibility to handle the situation with compassion. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary emotional support despite the professional setting.\n"
