In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the person helped onboard the new girl, was friendly but professional. The girl immediately expressed love, which the author dismissed as infatuation. Then the girl started crying at work. The author changed their behavior to be more professional, which caused more crying. Later, during a team-building event, the girl confessed again in public, leading to an emotional outburst. The author took her home, but stayed silent, even turning up the radio. The author never apologized and kept things professional.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the key points. The girl is new, young, and clearly emotionally vulnerable. The author, while remaining professional, could have handled the situation with more empathy. Even if the feelings are unreciprocated, dismissing them harshly in a public setting and then not consoling her during her emotional breakdown might be seen as insensitive.\n\nWorkplace dynamics are important. While maintaining professionalism is crucial, especially when there's a power imbalance (like age or experience difference), completely ignoring the emotional state of a colleague could be harmful. The author didn't need to reciprocate the feelings, but responding with some level of compassion might have been the right approach. The fact that the girl cried at work and then again publicly might indicate that the author's response was too abrupt.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to drop her off but not console her, even when she was crying and screaming, might be seen as not taking responsibility for their part in her emotional state. Even if the feelings are unrequited, there's a line between maintaining boundaries and being heartless.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't wrong for not having feelings, the way they handled the situation\u2014especially during the ride home\u2014could be seen as lacking empathy, making them at least partially in the wrong.\n"
