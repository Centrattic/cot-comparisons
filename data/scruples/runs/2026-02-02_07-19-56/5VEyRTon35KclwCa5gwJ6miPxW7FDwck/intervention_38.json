In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a new coworker who had a crush and the author didn't console her after rejecting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author helped the girl onboarding, which is professional. But when she confessed her feelings, he told her it was infatuation. She cried, and he distanced himself. Then, in a team-building event, she confessed again publicly, and he shut her down, leading her to break down. He didn't console her during the ride home, even increasing the radio volume when she cried. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess. The main issue here is whether the author's response was appropriate. In a workplace, maintaining professionalism is important, especially when someone expresses romantic feelings. However, the way the author handled the situation might be problematic. \n\nWhen she first expressed feelings, he could have been more empathetic. Instead of changing his behavior to the point of minimal communication, which caused her to cry more, maybe he should have set boundaries while being kind. During the hike, his reaction of silencing her and not offering any comfort might have been harsh. Even though he's not obligated to console her, his lack of response could be seen as cruel. \n\nHowever, he did try to keep it professional after the initial rejection. The fact that she moved on quickly might suggest the issue wasn't too severe. But the method he used to distance himself and the lack of empathy during her emotional breakdown could make him the asshole. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to consider the workplace environment. Publicly rejecting someone and not offering any compassion might create a hostile work environment. The author should have handled it privately and with more sensitivity. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he could have been more compassionate and professional in his response, rather than being dismissive and unresponsive to her emotional state.\n"
