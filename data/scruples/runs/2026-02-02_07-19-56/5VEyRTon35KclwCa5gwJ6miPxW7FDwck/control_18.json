In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that a new coworker had a crush on them, and they didn't console her when she got upset after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author helped onboarding, was friendly, but there's an age difference. The girl told them she loves them her first week, and the author rejected her, saying it's infatuation. She cried, and the author became more professional. Then, during a team-building hike, she professed her love again publicly. The author shut her down, leading to a crying fit. On the ride home, the author didn't console her, turned up the radio, and dropped her off without apology. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about professional boundaries. The author tried to stay professional, which is important in a workplace. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, especially in a public setting and during a company event, there's an expectation to show some empathy, even if you're not interested. The author's response of silence and increasing the radio volume might be seen as dismissive and lacking compassion. Even if there's no romantic interest, ignoring someone's emotional state could be considered unkind. The fact that the girl moved on quickly might not absolve the author of responsibility here. The key points are the public humiliation, failure to console, and the lack of professional empathy. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't handle the situation with the necessary sensitivity, even if maintaining professional distance is important.\n"
