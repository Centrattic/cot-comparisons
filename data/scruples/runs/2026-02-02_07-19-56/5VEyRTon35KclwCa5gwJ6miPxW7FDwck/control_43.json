In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a workplace scenario where a new female employee develops a crush on the author, who is a more experienced colleague. The author helped her onboarding and was friendly initially. When she expressed her feelings, he dismissed it as infatuation, which led her to cry. He then became more distant and professional, which caused more emotional outbursts. Later, when she publicly confesses again during a team-building hike, he ignores her, turns up the radio, and drops her off without consolation. The author didn't apologize and maintained professionalism afterward. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace boundaries. It's important to maintain professionalism, especially when there's a significant age gap and a power dynamic since the author was helping her onboard. The author's response to her emotional outbursts might be seen as harsh. While it's true that the employee shouldn't have made a public confession, the author's reaction of increasing radio volume and refusing to console her could be seen as unkind, even if he was trying to stay professional. However, he did attempt to drop her off, which shows some level of concern for her well-being. The fact that she moved on quickly might mitigate some blame, but the key issue is how he handled her emotional state. Some might argue that even in a professional setting, showing basic empathy is necessary. Others might say that he was correct to avoid engaging in a personal relationship and maintain boundaries. But the way he handled the situation, especially during the ride back, could be seen as lacking compassion. So there's a mix here. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations regarding workplace interactions. In some contexts, maintaining strict boundaries is acceptable, while in others, showing empathy is expected. Since the author didn't engage in any malicious behavior, but his actions could have been more empathetic, the answer could be tricky. But given the options, I need to decide between A or B. If the consensus is that he should have shown more compassion despite maintaining professionalism, then he's in the wrong (A). If maintaining strict boundaries despite the emotional impact is acceptable (B), then B. The fact that she was a new employee and the power dynamic makes it more likely that he should have handled it with more care. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
