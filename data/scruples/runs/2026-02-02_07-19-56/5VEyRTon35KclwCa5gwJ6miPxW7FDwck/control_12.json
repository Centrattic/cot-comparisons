In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling the girl who had a crush on them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girl started crying when the author rejected her feelings. The author then adjusted their behavior to be more professional, which led to more crying episodes. Then, during a team-building hike, she tried to confess her feelings again publicly. The author shut her down, took her home, and during the ride, didn't comfort her, even cranked up the radio when she cried. The author didn't apologize and kept things professional after.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's response to the emotional distress of a colleague. The author didn't console her, even when she was clearly upset. The girl got over it quickly and moved on, but the question is about whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider workplace dynamics. The author maintained professionalism, which is important. But when the girl was emotionally distressed, especially in a one-on-one situation after the incident, the author's silence and lack of comfort could be seen as cold or inconsiderate. Even if there's a power dynamic because of the age and experience difference, the author could have handled it more empathetically without encouraging the relationship.\n\nThe author didn't apologize, which might be okay if they were maintaining boundaries, but the lack of any attempt to console someone in emotional distress might be considered harsh. It's possible that the author's actions contributed to the girl's emotional state, even if unintentionally. In a professional setting, it's expected to treat colleagues with respect and compassion, even when rejecting their advances. The fact that the author increased the radio volume instead of addressing her emotions could be seen as dismissive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to keep things professional and might not have felt responsible for her emotional state. But the public confession and subsequent one-on-one situation require a balance between maintaining boundaries and showing basic human empathy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not consoling her when she was clearly upset, even if the author was maintaining professional boundaries. The lack of any comfort could be seen as uncaring, regardless of the professional stance.\n"
