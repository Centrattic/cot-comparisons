In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a new girl starts at their company, and the author helps her onboard. The girl develops a crush, tells the author she loves him, and he dismisses it as infatuation. She reacts emotionally, starts crying, and he changes his behavior to be more professional. This leads to more crying episodes at work and then again in a team-building hike where she professes her feelings again. The author shuts her down, doesn't console her, and instead of comforting her, he increases the radio volume and stays silent. He also doesn't apologize and the girl moves on to someone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is in an IT company, trying to be professional. The girl is fresh out of college, there's an age gap. He helped her onboard, which is part of his job. When she tells him she loves him, he responds that it's infatuation. That might be a valid response because sometimes people can get infatuated quickly, especially when they're younger. But then, when she's crying, he changes his behavior to be minimal and professional. That part is understandable because he wants to maintain professionalism. However, when she has another episode during the hike, he doesn't console her. He stays silent and increases the radio volume. \n\nThe key points here are about empathy and professional boundaries. The author is clearly setting boundaries by not engaging with her romantic overtures, which is important in a workplace. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, even if it's due to their own actions, there's a social expectation to be compassionate. The author didn't console her, which might be seen as uncaring, even if he's not responsible for her feelings. \n\nBut then again, the author is trying to maintain professionalism and isn't engaging in a relationship. The girl's reactions are extreme, and he's not in a position to be in a romantic relationship with a subordinate, especially someone with less experience. The fact that she moved on to someone else shows she recovered, but the question is whether the author's actions were appropriate in that moment. \n\nThe author's silence during her emotional breakdown might be seen as harsh. Even if he's not obligated to console her, responding with empathy could have mitigated the situation. However, since he's trying to stay professional, maybe he felt that any engagement would encourage her further. But increasing the radio volume and staying silent could be seen as dismissive and not showing basic human kindness. \n\nSo, the balance between professionalism and empathy is tricky here. The author is right to avoid a romantic relationship at work, but the way he handled her emotional state could be criticized. The answer might depend on whether you prioritize maintaining professional boundaries over showing compassion in a difficult moment.\n"
