In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by not consoling the girl who had a crush on them. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in an IT company and worked with a new female colleague. They helped her get onboarded, and she developed a crush. She openly told him she loved him, and he told her it was just infatuation. She cried. He then kept things professional, which led to more crying episodes. Then during a hike, she tried again to profess her love publicly. He shut her down, and she had a breakdown. He took her home, but stayed silent, turned up the radio volume when she cried, and didn't console her. The question is if he was in the wrong for not comforting her.\n\nHmm. Well, the author is in a professional setting. It's important to maintain boundaries, especially with a junior colleague. The girl was fresh out of college, and there's an age gap. So, she's vulnerable here. The author made it clear he wasn't interested, which is fair. But when she's emotional and crying, maybe he should have handled it differently. \n\nThe issue is whether he had a responsibility to console her. Even if he wasn't interested, being unresponsive or even hostile (like turning up the radio) during her emotional breakdown might be seen as cruel. He didn't apologize, which adds to the problem. While maintaining professionalism is important, completely ignoring someone's emotional distress could be inconsiderate. \n\nBut on the other hand, he did try to keep things professional. The girl's actions were public and disruptive. Maybe the author felt justified in not engaging further. However, when she was clearly upset, especially during the car ride, his silence and lack of empathy might be seen as wrong. The key here is balancing professionalism with empathy. \n\nIn the workplace, especially with a junior employee, it's important to handle situations with care. Even if he wasn't interested, a simple acknowledgment or offering support might have been better than turning up the radio. The fact that she moved on quickly might not excuse his behavior, because it's about how he treated her at the time.\n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because he didn't show empathy during her emotional crisis, which could have made things worse. The answer should be A.\n"
