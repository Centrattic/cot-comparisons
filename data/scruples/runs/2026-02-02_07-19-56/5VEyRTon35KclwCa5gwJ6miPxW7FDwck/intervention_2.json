In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new employee with a crush, who the writer helped onboard. The writer rejected her advances, which made her cry, and then during a team-building hike, she tried to confess again publicly. The writer shut her down, took her home, and stayed silent during the ride, even turning up the radio to drown out her crying. The question is whether the author is an asshole for not consoling her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The writer says they tried to remain professional, helped the new employee who was fresh out of college, and there was an age difference. The girl made a romantic confession early on, which the writer dismissed as infatuation. The girl cried, and the writer became more professional but that led to more crying. Then, during the hike, she confessed again publicly, leading to a breakdown where the writer didn't console her, instead being silent and increasing the radio volume.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. So, in terms of workplace behavior, maintaining professionalism is important. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, especially after being rejected, there's an expectation of empathy. The writer's response during the ride home seems harsh. Not consoling someone who's crying and screaming, even if you're not interested, could be seen as uncaring. The fact that the writer increased the radio volume to avoid interacting might be seen as intentionally ignoring her pain, which is unkind. \n\nBut on the other hand, the writer might be trying to avoid further confrontation or emotional entanglement. They might feel it's not their responsibility to comfort someone after a rejection, especially in a professional setting. However, the situation was outside the office (team-building hike), and the writer was accompanying her home. In that context, basic human decency might require some level of empathy or at least not exacerbating the situation by ignoring her distress.\n\nThe age difference and her being new to the workplace could also be factors. Maybe she's inexperienced in handling rejection, and the writer, being more mature, should have handled it with more care. The writer's approach of completely cutting off communication might have been too abrupt. Even if they didn't want to encourage her, a more compassionate response could have helped her feel less humiliated.\n\nAlso, the writer didn't apologize for anything. In a professional environment, maintaining boundaries is important, but causing emotional harm through public rejection and then ignoring her distress could cross into unprofessional territory. The fact that she moved on quickly might not absolve the writer of being an asshole in the situation.\n\nSo, considering empathy, professionalism, and the context of a public team event where the writer volunteered to take her home, the writer's lack of consoling could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
