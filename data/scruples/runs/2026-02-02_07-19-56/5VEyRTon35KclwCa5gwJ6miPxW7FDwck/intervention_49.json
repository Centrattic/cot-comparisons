In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who rejected a girl's advances at work, and she got upset. He didn't console her, kept things professional, and she eventually moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace boundaries. The girl was new, fresh out of college, and there was an age gap. He was onboarding her, so his role was professional. She confesses her feelings, which he clearly rejects, saying it's infatuation. She reacts emotionally, crying in the office. He adjusts his behavior to be more professional to avoid making her uncomfortable. Then, during a team-building event, she tries to profess her love again in public. He shuts her down, which causes a scene. On the ride back, she's crying, he doesn't console her, turns up the radio, and drops her off without speaking.\n\nThe main question is whether he's an asshole for not consoling her. The user thinks he is, but wants to know my opinion. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. It's important to maintain professionalism, especially when there's a power dynamic (onboarding a new employee) or an age difference. By rejecting her advances, he's staying professional. However, when she's upset, especially in public, there's a social expectation to show some empathy, even if you don't reciprocate feelings. His reaction of silence and ignoring her emotional state might be seen as cold or dismissive. But he could argue that he's trying to avoid any further issues and keep things professional. \n\nHowever, in the moment when she's clearly distressed, even if the feelings aren't mutual, there's a basic human decency to acknowledge someone's pain. He could have said something like, \"I'm sorry this is hurting you,\" even if he wasn't going to engage further. His actions of increasing the radio volume and remaining silent might be seen as intentionally avoiding any interaction, which could be harsh. \n\nAlso, the fact that she moved on after a few weeks suggests that she eventually recovered, but the immediate response might still be seen as lacking in compassion. The company's environment could be affected if others saw the public outburst, but he handled the ride back by not escalating it. \n\nIn summary, while he maintained professional boundaries, his lack of consoling her could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not showing empathy despite keeping professionalism.\n"
