In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on them. The scenario is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, so the answer needs to be either A or B.\n\nFirst, the user says they work in an IT company and try to be professional. They helped a new, younger colleague during onboarding. The girl told them she loves them, and the person responded that it's just infatuation. The girl started crying, and the person then kept their interactions minimal and professional. This led to more crying episodes.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, the girl professes her love again publicly. The person shuts her down, which causes a breakdown. They take her home but don't console her, instead increasing the radio volume when she's upset. After that, they continue to keep the relationship professional and never apologized. The girl moved on quickly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. So, the question is whether the author's actions were asshole-like.\n\nIn a workplace context, maintaining professionalism is key. When a colleague, especially a junior one, has a crush and expresses it, the appropriate response is to be respectful and set boundaries without being harsh. The initial response of saying it's infatuation might be dismissive but not necessarily wrong if done kindly. However, the subsequent actions\u2014increasing radio volume during her emotional breakdown and not console her at all\u2014seem uncaring and potentially unprofessional. \n\nEven if the person doesn't want to pursue a relationship, it's important to show empathy. Publicly rejecting someone can be hurtful, and being silent and using the radio to drown out her emotions during the ride home doesn't demonstrate compassion. The fact that the girl was young and new to the workplace might mean she was more vulnerable, so the person in a more experienced position should handle the situation with more care.\n\nThe author could have acknowledged her feelings, expressed that they can't reciprocate, and redirected the conversation to professional matters. Staying silent and avoiding any emotional support, especially when she's clearly upset, could be seen as contributing to a hostile environment. Plus, the author didn't apologize, which might indicate a lack of remorse for their actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to keep things professional and didn't encourage the relationship. But the way they handled the rejection and the breakdown was cold. The girl's response was intense, but that doesn't mean the author should have been unkind. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, even if their intent was to maintain professionalism. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
