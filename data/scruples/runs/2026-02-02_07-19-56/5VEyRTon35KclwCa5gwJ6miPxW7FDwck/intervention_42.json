In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author did the wrong thing by not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation started when the girl, new to the job and fresh out of college, told the author she loves him. He responded that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love him. She cried, he became more professional, leading to more crying. Later, in a team-building hike, she professed her love again publicly. He shut her down, then during the ride home, she was upset and he didn't console her, even turning up the radio. The author didn't apologize and kept things professional.\n\nSo, the key points here: The girl is new, maybe vulnerable. The author realized she had a crush early on, then rejected her, which led to emotional reactions. Then, when she tried again publicly, he ignored her emotional outbursts during the ride. The question is whether he was wrong for not consoling her.\n\nFrom a professional standpoint, it's important to maintain boundaries, especially in a workplace. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, even if the situation is uncomfortable, showing some level of empathy or at least not exacerbating the situation might be expected. The author didn't respond to her crying, didn't apologize, and even turned up the radio to avoid interaction. That could be seen as cruel or uncaring, even if the initial rejection was necessary. The author might be in the wrong for not showing compassion during her emotional breakdown, even if the initial rejection was appropriate. On the other hand, the girl's actions were unprofessional, and the author was trying to maintain professionalism. But the way he handled the aftermath, especially during the ride home, could be considered harsh. So, I think the author is in the wrong because while maintaining professionalism is key, completely ignoring someone's emotional state and not offering any comfort or acknowledgment could be seen as lacking empathy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
