In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author of the story is wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on him. The situation is at work, and the author tried to stay professional. The girl started crying when he rejected her, and he kept his distance, which led to more crying episodes. Then, during a team-building hike, she confessed again in public, he shut her down, and during the ride home, she was upset but he didn't console her, just turned up the radio and dropped her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace boundaries. The author was professional and didn't encourage the relationship. When the girl expressed feelings, he clearly stated it was infatuation. But then, when she's emotional, he doesn't console her. Is that wrong? Well, in a workplace, it's important to maintain professionalism, but treating someone with empathy is also key. Even if there's a professional need to distance, responding to someone's emotional distress with silence and ignoring their feelings might be seen as harsh. \n\nHe did drop her off, which shows some level of care, but not comforting her during her emotional breakdown could be seen as uncaring. Even if he didn't want to engage in a relationship, being empathetic is important. The key points are: maintaining professional boundaries is correct, but responding to someone's emotional state without support might cross into being unkind. \n\nThe girl eventually moved on, so maybe the immediate impact wasn't long-term. But the act of not consoling could be seen as insensitive. So, the author might be in the wrong for not showing empathy despite the professional stance. However, some might argue that he had a right to keep his distance. But the silent treatment and ignoring her distress during the ride seems harsh. So leaning towards A (he's in the wrong) because empathy is important even in professional settings.\n"
