In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a new coworker who develops a crush on the author. The author initially interacts with her professionally but after she declares her feelings, they become distant. Then, when she professes her love again in a team-building event, the author responds by being silent and increasing the radio volume, leading to her crying. The author doesn't apologize and the coworker moves on to someone else.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author tried to be professional, and the coworker's actions might be out of line. However, when someone is emotionally distressed, even if it's due to their own actions, there's an expectation of some level of empathy, even if you don't reciprocate feelings. The author didn't engage in a conversation when she was clearly upset, which could be seen as callous. \n\nThe key points are: the author shut down communication, ignored her emotional state during the ride back, and never apologized. Even if the coworker was inappropriate, the author's response of silence and lack of consolation might be seen as unkind. However, the author tried to maintain professionalism, and in some cases, people might think that's necessary to avoid workplace complications.\n\nBut when someone is in distress, especially because of something you said, there's a social expectation to acknowledge it, even if you don't want to engage. The author's approach of ignoring and increasing the music volume could be seen as avoiding responsibility. The fact that the coworker got over it quickly might suggest she wasn't severely harmed, but that's not the main point. The author's actions during the emotional moment are questionable.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't show any empathy during her emotional breakdown, even if they don't have feelings for her. The appropriate response would be to acknowledge her feelings, maybe set boundaries, but not to ignore or mock the situation. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). Wait, but some might argue that the author has the right to maintain distance. However, the lack of any attempt to console her even when she's clearly upset crosses a line. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
