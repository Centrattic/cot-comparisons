In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The author's actions are being judged here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author helped onboard a new employee, which is part of their job. The girl had a crush and expressed her feelings, which the author dismissed as infatuation. The girl then started crying. The author then tried to keep interactions professional, but the girl continued to have emotional outbursts, especially in public during a team-building hike. The author didn't console her during the ride back, instead increasing the radio volume and staying silent.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: \n\n1. **Professional Boundaries**: The author tried to maintain professionalism after the girl's initial confession. However, when the girl had emotional outbursts, especially in public, the author's response might be seen as harsh. Even if the feelings were unrequited, there's a responsibility to handle such situations with empathy in a professional setting.\n\n2. **Emotional Response**: The girl was crying and screaming, which is a distressing situation. The author's silence and increasing the radio volume could be seen as dismissive and uncaring. While the author might not be obligated to console her, intentionally ignoring someone in distress might cross a line.\n\n3. **Workplace Environment**: The author's actions could affect workplace dynamics. Even if the girl eventually moved on, the immediate response could have created a hostile work environment. Professionalism often requires more than just being neutral; it includes showing basic respect and empathy.\n\n4. **Context of Age Difference**: The girl was fresh out of college with an age difference. This might mean she's less experienced in handling workplace relationships, making the situation more sensitive. The author's response could be seen as exacerbating her distress.\n\n5. **Long-term Impact**: Even if the girl moved on, the author's actions might have contributed to her emotional distress. The lack of apology or follow-up could be viewed as not taking responsibility for their part in the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't in a romantic relationship and was trying to maintain boundaries. However, the way they handled the emotional outbursts might be considered inconsiderate. The key issue is whether the author's response was appropriate in terms of empathy and professional conduct.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, lacked the necessary empathy and could be seen as contributing to a stressful environment. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
