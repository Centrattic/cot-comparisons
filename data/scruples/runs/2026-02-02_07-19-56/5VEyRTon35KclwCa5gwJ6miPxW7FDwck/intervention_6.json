In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not consoling the girl who had a crush on them. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person works in IT and tries to be professional. A new girl starts, and they help her on-board. The author acted friendly as usual. The girl, being new and maybe young, tells the author she loves them. The author responds that it's infatuation and not real love. The girl starts crying. The author then becomes more distant and professional, which leads to more crying episodes.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, the girl professed her love again publicly. The author shut her down, which caused her to have a breakdown. The author took her home, and during the ride, she kept crying and screaming. The author didn't console her, increased the radio volume when she cried, dropped her off without saying anything else, and kept professional at work. The author never apologized. The girl eventually moved on to someone else.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for not consoling her?\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong. Let me think why. When someone is emotionally vulnerable, especially in a public setting like a team-building event, it's important to respond with empathy. The girl was clearly upset, and the author's response of silence and increasing the radio volume seems dismissive and cruel. Even if the author didn't want a relationship, responding with kindness is necessary. The fact that the girl was new and possibly young (age difference mentioned) makes the situation more sensitive. The author's actions could have made her feel humiliated or unsupported. In a workplace, maintaining professionalism is important, but it shouldn't come at the cost of someone's emotional well-being. The author didn't have to engage in a romantic relationship, but there's a responsibility to be compassionate, especially after the initial rejection led to crying. Not consoling her, especially during a breakdown, seems harsh. Even if the author wanted to avoid the situation, offering some basic support or at least not amplifying the distress by ignoring her could have been better. The author's choice to increase the radio volume instead of trying to calm her down shows a lack of empathy. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
