In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author helped a new employee who was fresh out of college. They were friendly initially, but when the girl declared her love, the author dismissed it as infatuation. The girl cried, so the author became more distant and professional. The girl then tried again in a public team-building event, leading to her breaking down again. The author didn't console her, even increasing the radio volume during the ride home.\n\nThe key points here are about professionalism and empathy. The author's actions kept things professional at work, which is important, but when a coworker is emotionally distressed, especially in a vulnerable position, there's an expectation to show some compassion. Even if the author wasn't interested in a relationship, reacting with silence and avoiding the emotional response might be seen as harsh. The fact that the author didn't apologize or offer any comfort could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they maintained professionalism afterward. The girl's age and inexperience might also play a role here, as she could be more emotionally sensitive. The author's approach might be effective in keeping work boundaries, but the lack of empathy during the emotional breakdown is questionable. So, I think the author is at least partially in the wrong for not showing some level of concern, even if they kept the workplace professional.\n"
