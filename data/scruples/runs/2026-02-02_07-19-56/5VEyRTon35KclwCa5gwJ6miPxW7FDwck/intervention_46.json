In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves the girl confessing her feelings twice, the author rejecting her, leading to emotional outbursts, and the author not comforting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is at work, so maintaining professionalism is important. The girl is new, younger, and seems emotionally vulnerable. The first confession led to crying, which the author then minimized contact with. The second time, in a public setting, the author shut her down again, leading to more crying. Then, during the car ride, the author didn't console her, even increasing the radio to avoid the conversation.\n\nThe key points here are the author's response to someone in an emotional state. Even if the feelings are unreciprocated, the girl is clearly distressed. While the author has the right to not be in a relationship, there's a line between being professional and being cruel. Not offering any comfort, especially when the person is crying and screaming, could be seen as lacking empathy. The author's silence and ignoring might have worsened the situation instead of de-escalating it. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girl moved on quickly, but that doesn't negate the need for compassion at the time. In a workplace, handling such situations sensitively is part of being a good colleague. The author's actions might have been harsh, even if their intention was to keep things professional. So, maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't show empathy even when the girl was clearly upset, despite the professional setting. It's possible to be both professional and compassionate.\n"
