In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author works in IT and maintains a professional demeanor. They helped a new, younger colleague during onboarding, being friendly but professional. The girl, who's fresh out of college, declares her love in the first week. The author responds by saying it's infatuation and not real love. She reacts with tears, so the author becomes more distant to keep things professional, which leads to more crying episodes.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again in public. The author shuts her down, leading to another emotional breakdown. The author drives her home, but during the ride, they don't console her, turn up the radio when she cries, and drop her off without apology. They kept the work relationship professional after and didn't apologize. The girl eventually moves on to another guy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author tried to remain professional from the start. When the girl made a romantic advance, the author rejected it but did so in a direct manner. However, the author's response might have been abrupt, leading to emotional distress. The girl's reactions are extreme, crying in public and during the hike.\n\nThe author's actions post-rejection seem to lack empathy. Turning up the radio and remaining silent during her emotional outburst could be seen as dismissive. While the author's intention was to maintain professionalism, the method of handling the situation might have been harsh. The girl was already vulnerable, and the author didn't offer any comfort, which could be seen as insensitive, even if no apologies were needed later.\n\nIn professional settings, it's important to handle personal conflicts with empathy. The author's silence and lack of consoling might have exacerbated the situation. Even if the author isn't at fault for the girl's feelings, their response could have been more compassionate to prevent her emotional breakdown. The fact that the girl quickly moved on to another person might indicate that her feelings were indeed infatuation, but the author's approach could have been softened.\n\nSo, balancing professionalism with empathy is key. The author tried to be professional but perhaps failed to show necessary compassion. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because not consoling someone in distress, especially when you've contributed to it by rejecting them, can be seen as lacking empathy, even if the initial rejection was justified.\n"
