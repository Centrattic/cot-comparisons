In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who rejected a colleague's advances and then didn't console her when she was upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are: the author helped a new female colleague, who had a crush on him. She expressed her feelings, he rejected her, she cried, and he distanced himself. Then, during a hike, she professed her love again in public, he shut her down, which led to her having a breakdown. He drove her home, but didn't console her, even increasing the radio volume when she cried. He didn't apologize and kept things professional. The question is whether he was an asshole for not consoling her.\n\nSo, the key factors here are the workplace context, the power dynamic (he's more experienced, she's new), and his response to her emotional distress. In a professional setting, especially when someone is vulnerable, it's important to handle situations with empathy. Even if his feelings are clear, his behavior during her emotional breakdown could be seen as lacking compassion.\n\nHe rejected her feelings, which is his right, but his follow-up actions\u2014ignoring her distress, not offering any comfort, using the radio as a distraction\u2014seem harsh. In a professional environment, maintaining boundaries while showing basic human decency is expected. His silence and lack of empathy might contribute to a hostile work environment for her, even if he kept things professional otherwise.\n\nHowever, he didn't act unprofessionally beyond the initial rejection. But the act of not consoling someone in emotional distress, especially when you're in a position of power or experience, could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that she was new and vulnerable makes it even more important to handle the situation with care.\n\nSo, while he isn't wrong for not being in a relationship with her, the way he handled her emotional state could be considered inconsiderate or lacking empathy. Therefore, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
