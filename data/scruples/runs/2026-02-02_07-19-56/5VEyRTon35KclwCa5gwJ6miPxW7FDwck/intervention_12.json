In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves the author working in an IT company, being professional, helping a new employee, then the girl confessing her feelings. The author tells her it's infatuation, leading to her crying. Then on a team-building hike, she confesses again publicly, and the author shuts her down, leading to more crying. The author takes her home but stays silent, even increasing the radio volume when she's upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's actions were to maintain professionalism and avoid any romantic involvement. However, the way they handled the situation might be problematic. When someone is clearly emotional and distressed, especially in a public setting, the appropriate response is usually to show empathy and compassion, even if you're not interested. The author's silence and ignoring her emotional state could be seen as cruel or inconsiderate. \n\nThe key points here are professional boundaries versus empathy. While it's valid to keep things professional, the author's response was extreme. By not consoling her and even increasing the radio volume, they might have contributed to her emotional distress. Even if the author isn't interested, the colleague's well-being should be considered. The fact that she later moved on to someone else might suggest she's okay now, but the immediate handling could still be seen as harsh.\n\nAdditionally, the author's approach of avoiding any communication after the initial incident might have been too abrupt, leading to more emotional episodes. A more compassionate approach could have been to acknowledge her feelings and set clear boundaries without being dismissive. The lack of any apology or effort to console her during the ride home is a red flag. It's possible the author prioritized their own comfort over the colleague's emotional state, which could be considered unkind.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that the author was maintaining professionalism and not engaging in inappropriate workplace behavior. But professional boundaries don't mean being indifferent. The line between professional and inconsiderate is thin here. The author's actions, while perhaps intended to keep things professional, came off as uncaring.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to stay professional, their method was flawed. They should have shown more empathy and support, even while rejecting the romantic advances. Not consoling someone who's clearly upset, especially in a vulnerable situation, is where they went wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
