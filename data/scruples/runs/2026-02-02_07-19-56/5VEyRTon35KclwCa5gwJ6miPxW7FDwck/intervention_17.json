In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling the girl who had a crush on him. The situation is that the author works in IT, helped a new colleague who was fresh out of college, and there was an age gap. The girl confessed her love early on, and the author dismissed it as infatuation. She started crying, so he became more distant and professional, which led to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she confessed again publicly, leading to another breakdown. The author didn't console her, increased the radio volume to drown out her crying, and dropped her off without speaking. The author didn't apologize and maintained professionalism. The person is asking if the author is an asshole for not consoling her.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how to handle a workplace situation where a colleague has a crush and then becomes emotional. The author's approach was to distance and not engage emotionally. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nFirst, in a professional setting, it's important to maintain boundaries. The girl's actions (professing love at work) might be unprofessional, but the author's response could be seen as harsh. When she cried after the first confession, the author's reaction of becoming distant probably wasn't helpful. Then, during the hike, instead of handling the emotional situation with some empathy, the author chose to ignore her and even used the radio to block out her emotions. That seems insensitive, even if the author is trying to stay professional. The author could have acknowledged her feelings without showing interest, maybe by expressing that they need to keep things professional and offering support if she needed to talk. By not consoling her at all, the author might have exacerbated her distress. Also, the fact that the girl moved on quickly doesn't negate the immediate impact of the author's actions.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author tried to remain professional. The girl's behavior was perhaps inappropriate for the workplace, especially since she was new and there was an age difference. The author's refusal to engage in a romantic relationship is understandable. However, the way he handled the emotional fallout could be questioned. The author's silence and avoidance might have been more harmful than necessary. There's a balance between professionalism and basic human empathy. The author's actions might not be malicious, but they show a lack of compassion. So, even if the author wasn't intentionally cruel, the way he handled it might make him an asshole in the eyes of others. The correct answer might be A (Yes), because he didn't console her even when she was clearly upset, which could be seen as unkind, regardless of professional boundaries.\n"
