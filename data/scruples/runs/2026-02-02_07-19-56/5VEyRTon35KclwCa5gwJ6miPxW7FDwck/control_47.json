In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author works in an IT company, helped onboarding a new colleague who was fresh out of college. There's an age gap, and this girl tells the author she loves him. The author responded by saying it's infatuation and changed their behavior to be more professional, which led to her crying. Later, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again publicly, and the author shuts her down, leading to another crying episode. On the ride home, the author ignores her emotional outbursts, even turning up the radio to drown out her crying. The author never apologized and kept things professional after that. The question is whether the author was an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace boundaries. The author was helping a new employee, which is reasonable. However, when the new employee expressed romantic feelings, the author dismissed it as infatuation. That part might be okay, but then the author's reaction to her crying could be an issue. The key points are: the girl was new and possibly vulnerable, there's an age difference, and the author's response was to shut her down both times. \n\nIn the first instance, when she told her feelings, the author didn't console her but instead distanced themselves. The second time, during the hike, the author didn't provide any comfort, even though she was clearly upset. The author increased the radio volume to avoid engaging, which seems cold and unempathetic. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. While it's important to maintain professionalism, especially when someone is in a vulnerable position (like a new, younger employee), there's also a responsibility to handle such situations with care. Dismissing someone's emotions and not offering any support could be seen as cruel, even if the author didn't reciprocate the feelings. \n\nThe age gap and her being new to the workforce might mean she's less experienced in handling rejections or understanding professional boundaries. The author's actions could be contributing to a hostile work environment for her, especially with the public rejection and the lack of empathy during her emotional breakdown on the ride home. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did change their behavior to be professional, which is correct. But the lack of any attempt to console her during the crying episodes might be crossing a line. Even if the author doesn't want to engage romantically, there's a basic human need to acknowledge someone's distress. \n\nThe fact that she moved on to someone else isn't the point here. The issue is about how the author handled her emotional state. The author's response could be seen as callous, not because they rejected her, but because they didn't offer any compassion during her obvious emotional pain. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with empathy, even if they maintained professional boundaries. The key is the response to her emotional distress, not just the rejection itself.\n"
