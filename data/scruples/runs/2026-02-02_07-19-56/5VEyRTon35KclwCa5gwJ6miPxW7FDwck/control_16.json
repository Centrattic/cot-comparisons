In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. The situation involves a new employee who expressed love, got upset, and the author responded by becoming more professional and not offering comfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider professional boundaries. The author helped the new employee initially, then after the love confession, they kept things professional. It's important in workplaces to maintain appropriate boundaries, especially when someone is showing romantic interest. The author didn't encourage the relationship, which is a good point.\n\nThe girl cried at work after being rejected. The author's response was to minimize interaction. But when she tried again in public during a team-building event, the author shut her down. Then, on the way back, she was emotional, and the author didn't console her, even increasing the radio volume. \n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the author had a responsibility to console her. In a professional setting, while empathy is important, the author isn't obligated to provide emotional support, especially after being rejected. However, completely ignoring her emotional state might be seen as harsh. The author's silence and lack of comfort could be considered inconsiderate, even if they weren't in a position to offer a relationship. \n\nAlso, the age difference and her being new might mean she's less experienced in handling such rejections. The author's actions could have been more compassionate, maybe redirecting her to HR or a proper support system instead of just dropping her off. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on balancing professionalism with empathy. The author maintained professional boundaries, which is correct, but their response during the emotional episode might lack empathy. However, since there's no requirement to offer personal comfort in such cases, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong. Others might say that a minimal level of humanity is expected. \n\nConsidering the outcome that she moved on quickly, maybe the author's actions weren't malicious. But the lack of any attempt to console her could be seen as uncaring. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they kept professional boundaries, but there's a gray area. However, the community might have mixed opinions. In AITA scenarios, sometimes silence or not offering comfort is seen as not necessarily wrong, especially if the person isn't responsible for her emotional state. So the answer might be B (No), but there's a possibility of A. Need to check common AITA standards. Typically, as long as the person isn't actively harming, maintaining professionalism is acceptable. However, the radio volume and complete silence might be seen as inconsiderate. Hmm. Maybe there's a middle ground. But the question is binary. If the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. If A, then yes. Given that the author didn't engage in the relationship and kept it professional, but didn't offer comfort when the other person was clearly upset, it's a tough call. But in professional contexts, you aren't required to console someone after a rejection. So B is likely correct.\n"
