In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author works in an IT company and has been professional but also friendly with colleagues. A new girl starts, and the author helps her onboard. They were friendly, but there's a big age difference. The girl tells the author she loves him in the first week, and he responds that it's just infatuation. She starts crying. He then keeps communication professional, which makes her cry more. Later, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again publicly. The author shuts her down, leading her to have a fit. He takes her home, and during the ride, she's crying and screaming, but he doesn't console her, just turns up the radio and stays silent. Afterward, he keeps things professional and never apologized. The girl moves on to someone else in a few weeks.\n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole for not consoiling her.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: he rejected her feelings, which she took very emotionally. He tried to maintain professionalism after the initial rejection. The second incident happened in public during a team-building event. The author's response was to shut down her confession, leading to her breakdown, and then during the ride home, he didn't console her but instead turned up the radio. \n\nNow, considering workplace dynamics. It's important to maintain professionalism, especially when there's an age gap and a power dynamic (he might be more experienced). The girl is a new employee, and her emotional response could affect her work. However, the author's approach of keeping professional distance might be justified to avoid any favoritism or inappropriate workplace relationships. \n\nBut when she's having an emotional breakdown, even if he doesn't reciprocate her feelings, there's an expectation to show empathy. Not consoling someone in distress could be seen as uncaring. However, the author might be trying to avoid encouraging her feelings further, so his silence is a way to not give false hope.\n\nThe key points here are: Is emotional support expected from a professional relationship? Did the author's actions contribute to her distress, making him responsible? Was his response during the ride home acceptable?\n\nIn a professional setting, even if personal feelings arise, maintaining empathy is usually expected. The author's refusal to engage in any emotional support during her breakdown might be seen as harsh. While he isn't obligated to have a relationship, ignoring someone's emotional state when they're clearly upset could be considered inconsiderate. Additionally, the public rejection and then not offering any support during a private moment might make him an asshole for not showing compassion.\n\nOn the other hand, he tried to keep his interactions professional, which is right. But when someone is in emotional distress, especially after your actions, providing some level of support is generally expected. The fact that he increased the radio volume to avoid conversation could be seen as avoiding the situation instead of addressing it.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because even though maintaining professionalism is important, not offering any consolation during her emotional crisis could be seen as lacking empathy. However, some might argue that he had the right to avoid involvement in a personal relationship. \n\nBut considering that his actions (public rejection, then ignoring her during the breakdown) directly contributed to her emotional state, he might be at fault for not showing support, even if he didn't want to engage further. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
