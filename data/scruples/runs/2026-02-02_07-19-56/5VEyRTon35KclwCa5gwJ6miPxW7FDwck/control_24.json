In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author works in IT and maintains a professional demeanor. A new female colleague, fresh out of college, started and developed a crush on him. He helped her onboard, being friendly as he does with others. When she told him she loved him in the first week, he told her it was just infatuation. She cried, and he then kept communication minimal and professional. This led to more crying episodes from her.\n\nLater, during a team-building hike, she publicly professes her love again. He shuts her down, leading to a breakdown, and he accompanies her home. On the way, he stays silent, even turning up the radio when she's upset. He doesn't console her, drops her off, and never apologizes. The colleague moves on after a few weeks.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are professional boundaries and handling the situation appropriately.\n\nFirst, the author was aware of the age difference and the colleague being new. He tried to be friendly but set clear boundaries when she expressed feelings. However, he dismissed her feelings as \"infatuation\" and didn't provide emotional support, especially during her crying episodes. Even when she's clearly distressed during the ride, he doesn't engage or console her. \n\nWhile maintaining professionalism is important, completely ignoring someone's emotional distress, especially after they've been hurt by your actions, might cross into being unkind or inconsiderate. Even if he doesn't want a relationship, a basic human response of empathy or offering some comfort could be expected. His silence and increasing the radio might be seen as neglecting her emotional state.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was new and possibly more vulnerable adds another layer. He had a role in her onboarding, so his actions might have had a bigger impact on her. Not apologizing later could be seen as not taking responsibility for his part in the situation, even if he believes he was right to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, he did try to keep things professional and avoid encouraging her feelings. Public declarations are challenging, and he might feel justified in not engaging. However, the lack of any comfort during her breakdown could be seen as harsh. The community often values empathy, even in professional settings.\n\nSo, the author might be seen as in the wrong (A) for not showing empathy and consoling her during her emotional distress, even if he was maintaining professional boundaries. The key here is the response to her emotional state, not just the initial rejection. The answer is likely A.\n"
