In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario did something wrong by not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author helped a new, younger colleague during onboarding. The girl confessed her love early on, and he rejected her, causing her to cry. He then kept professional distance, which led to more crying episodes. Later, she publicly declared her feelings again during a team hike, and he dropped her off without offering comfort, even turning up the radio during her emotional outbursts.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The key points are professional boundaries, emotional response, and responsibility towards a colleague's well-being. \n\nThe author initially rejected the girl's advances, which is reasonable if there's no mutual romantic interest. However, publicly humiliating her by ignoring her emotional distress might cross a line. Even though he tried to maintain professionalism, his silence and lack of empathy could be seen as cruel, especially since she was a new employee and clearly distressed. \n\nWorkplace relationships require sensitivity. While he's not obligated to have a romantic relationship, ignoring her emotional state could contribute to a hostile work environment. The fact that she moved on quickly might not absolve him of responsibility for his actions during the incident. \n\nPossible arguments: He had the right to decline, but the manner in which he handled her emotional reactions could be considered unkind. Consoling someone in distress is a basic human decency, even if it's not a requirement. His silence and actions during the ride back might have exacerbated her emotional state, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, maintaining professional boundaries is important. He tried to keep things professional post-rejection, which is good. But the public declaration and his response might have been mishandled. \n\nIn conclusion, while rejecting her affection isn't wrong, failing to show any empathy or support during her emotional breakdown could make him the asshole. The answer is likely A (Yes), because even if he's not required to comfort her, his actions were inconsiderate and possibly contributed to her distress.\n"
