During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on them. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author works in an IT company and tries to be professional. They helped a new colleague get on-boarded and were friendly, which is normal. The girl, who was fresh out of college and had an age difference, told them she loves them in the first week. The author told her it's just infatuation and that she doesn't really love them. She started crying, and then the author changed their behavior to be more professional and minimal, which led to more crying episodes.\n\nThen, during a team-building hike, she professed her love again in public. The author shut her down, leading to a fit where she couldn't continue. The author took her home, and during the ride, she kept crying and screaming. The author didn't console her, instead turning up the radio, and dropped her off without saying anything else. They kept the relationship professional after that and never apologized. The girl moved on to someone else in a few weeks.\n\nSo, the key points here are about professional boundaries and how to handle a romantic interest in the workplace. The author's actions seem to be about maintaining professionalism, but the way they handled the emotional situation is questionable. \n\nWhen someone is emotionally distraught, especially in a professional setting, it's generally considered appropriate to show some level of empathy or at least not actively ignore or avoid comforting them. The author's response of increasing the radio volume and remaining silent could be seen as dismissive and lacking in compassion. Even if the author didn't want to engage in a romantic relationship, responding to someone's emotional distress with silence and avoidance might be considered harsh or inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, considering the professional context, the author might argue that they were trying to maintain boundaries and avoid any personal entanglements. But the act of not consoling someone who is clearly upset could still be seen as unkind. The fact that the girl was new and perhaps more vulnerable (being fresh out of college) might also play a role here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did not engage in any behavior that encouraged the crush; they were clear that they weren't interested and adjusted their interactions to be professional. But the aftermath, where the girl was clearly in emotional distress, the author's lack of response might be seen as contributing to a negative work environment or being insensitive.\n\nIn many workplace scenarios, even if you're not interested in a romantic relationship, it's important to handle the situation with empathy to prevent the other person from feeling humiliated or distressed. The author's approach might not be malicious, but the lack of consolation could be seen as a failure to manage the emotional fallout, which might make them the asshole in the situation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not showing any empathy during the girl's emotional breakdown, even if their intention was to maintain professionalism. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong)."
