In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not consoling a girl who had a crush on them. The situation involves workplace interactions where the woman develops feelings, declares them, and the author responds by keeping things professional and not providing emotional support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author helped the girl during onboarding, which is part of their job. The girl had a crush and expressed it, which the author dismissed as infatuation. The key points here are professional boundaries and emotional responsibility.\n\nThe author changed their behavior to be strictly professional after the initial declarations of love. When the girl cried, the author kept silent and even turned up the radio. The question is whether the author was wrong to not console her. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. While it's important to maintain professionalism, there's a line between being professional and being cruel. The girl was new, maybe emotionally vulnerable, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive. However, the author didn't encourage the relationship and tried to avoid being rude. \n\nAnother angle is the author's responsibility. Even if the feelings aren't reciprocated, there's an argument that showing some empathy is necessary, especially when someone is clearly upset. The author's silence and increasing the radio might have been harsh, potentially making the workplace uncomfortable for the girl. \n\nBut the girl later moved on to someone else, suggesting she recovered quickly. The author's main goal was to maintain professionalism, which they did. However, the lack of any attempt to console her, even if just to be polite, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether professional behavior requires some level of empathy even when rejecting someone's feelings. If you're in a position where someone is emotionally vulnerable, a minimal response might be necessary to maintain a positive work environment. The author's actions, while professional, might have been overly cold. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though maintaining professional boundaries is important, completely ignoring someone's emotional distress could be seen as unkind and detrimental to workplace morale. However, there's also the counter-argument that the author isn't responsible for the girl's feelings and it's not their role to console someone they don't have a romantic interest in. \n\nBut I think the consensus would lean towards the author being wrong for not at least showing some empathy, even if they didn't reciprocate the feelings. Turning up the radio and staying silent seems unnecessarily harsh. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
