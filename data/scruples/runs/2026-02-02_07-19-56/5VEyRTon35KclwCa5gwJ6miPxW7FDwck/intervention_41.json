In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not consoling the girl who had a crush on him. The author helped onboarding her, then she confessed her love, he rejected her, and she cried. He tried to remain professional but avoided her, which made her cry more. Then, during a team-building event, she confessed again in public, he shut her down, and she had a breakdown. He drove her home, she cried, he didn't console her, just turned up the radio, and dropped her off.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: He rejected her feelings, which is his right. But how he handled it might be an issue. The girl is new, young, and clearly emotionally vulnerable. He initially helped her, which might have led to her developing a crush. Then he changed his behavior to be more professional, which could have made her feel rejected. The public rejection during the hike might have been harsh, even if he didn't mean to. Then, in the car, he didn't console her. Instead of trying to de-escalate the situation, he used the radio to avoid interaction. That seems cold.\n\nProfessionally, maintaining boundaries is important, but there's a balance. Even if he didn't want to be in a relationship, he could have shown more empathy. The girl was upset, and not offering any comfort might be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that he didn't apologize later also adds to the impression that he didn't care about her feelings. However, he did keep things professional after that, which is good. The question is whether he was wrong to not console her. The girl eventually moved on, so maybe it wasn't a big issue, but his approach might have been unnecessarily harsh. So I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he could have handled it with more kindness without compromising professionalism.\n"
