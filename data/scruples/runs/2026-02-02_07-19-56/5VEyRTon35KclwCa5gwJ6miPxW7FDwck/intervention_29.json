In the process I behaved in a friendly manner as I do with all the other colleagues. It's important to note that she was fresh out of college and there was quite a few years of age difference between us. The very first week she told me that she loves me. I told her that it's just infatuation and she doesn't really love me. Her first reaction was to start crying at the workplace. Anyways, I changed my behavior with her and kept the communication to a minimum and completely professional just to the point while trying not to be rude. This sent her into more crying episodes.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA few weeks later while on a team building hike, she thought it would be a good idea to profess her love to me again in public. I completely shut her down which sent her into a fit and she was unable to carry on. I volunteered to drop her back home and accompany her on the way back. During the ride back it was just me and her. She kept crying and screaming at me for how I was breaking her heart and rejecting her, all the while I just kept silent. Every time she would start crying or screaming I would increase the radio volume even higher without saying a word. At the end I just dropped her off at her place and never said anything more. I kept the relationship at work professional afterwards and never apologized for anything.  \n\n\nWas I an asshole for not consoling her?\n\nP.S. She got over it and moved on to the next guy in a few weeks.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not consoling a coworker who had a crush on them. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author helped a new employee get on-boarded and was friendly. The new girl, who's fresh out of college and younger, tells him she loves him early on. He responds that it's infatuation, which leads her to cry. Then he distances himself professionally, leading to more crying episodes. Later, during a team-building hike, she professes her love again in public. He shuts her down, and she has a breakdown. On the ride back, he's silent and even turns up the radio when she's crying, eventually dropping her off without consoling her. The author doesn't apologize and maintains a professional relationship after that.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The girl is new, younger, and possibly inexperienced. The author is in a position of influence. When someone is vulnerable and expressing emotions, even if it's unrequited, there's an expectation of some level of empathy. The author's response was to shut down, ignore her emotional state, and even escalate by turning up the radio. This could be seen as callous, especially in a professional setting where maintaining a supportive environment is important. \n\nHowever, the author did try to keep things professional. The girl then moved on to someone else, which might suggest she didn't suffer long-term damage. But the immediate reaction of not offering any support could still be seen as harsh. The author's silence and lack of empathy during her emotional breakdown might have been unkind, even if not malicious. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that he was maintaining professional boundaries and avoiding any potential harassment claims. Still, the way he handled it could have been more compassionate. Instead of increasing the radio, he could have at least acknowledged her feelings or provided some comfort. The fact that he never apologized and continued to be professional after doesn't absolve him of the initial response.\n\nIn professional environments, especially with junior employees, it's important to handle such situations with care. Even if the feelings are unrequited, a more empathetic approach would be better. The author's actions might be seen as neglecting his responsibility to support a colleague in distress, hence making him at fault.\n"
